This pool of experts includes experts in digitalisation and green engineering who accompany applicants by coaching and mentoring them. This enables Partners to implement the coaching and mentoring services (CMS) by supporting companies in the strategic design and implementation of new and innovative digital and green approaches, technologies, business models, and ensuring a successful implementation. The pool of experts is expected to grow steadily during the project lifetime.The applicant SME, start-ups, VSB may contact one or more experts either from the list available on the submission platform: https://clustersubmissionplatform.eu/service-providers-resist/and the ECCP or propose an expert outside the list and invite them to submit an offer for the respective coaching and mentoring service, and finally selects one expert. If the selected expert is not an expert listed in the pool, he can join the pool of experts to expand the range of offered services to SMEs in the Mobility-Transport-Automotive within the RESIST project. Experts interested in joining the pool of experts have the option to apply for the Open Call for expression of interest for service providers either before or after the contract is signed. Experts can apply throughout the duration of the RESIST project until 10/10/2024 00:00. This step is not obligatory but provides an opportunity for experts to express their interest in participating. Participating in a pool of experts offers the expert two key advantages:Collaboration and knowledge exchange: By being part of the pool, the expert can collaborate with other skilled professionals, fostering a learning environment and leading to the development of new ideas and approaches.Increased visibility and opportunities: Joining the pool exposes the expert to a larger audience of potential beneficiaries, creating more opportunities to work on projects or provide services to a diverse range of clients. The applicants receive financial support in the form of grants through reimbursement of actual cost for the CMS from the consortium. This support is named FSTP = financial support to third parties. 1. Financial support Two types of financial support are offered in the frame of this Call about coaching and mentoring services (CMS):a. Assessment financial support, for assessing the current status regarding green/digital maturity of the SME, start-ups, VSB and giving advice for improvements.b. Feasibility financial support, for implementing a detailed analysis that considers all the critical aspects of a proposed improvement plan, innovation project or similar, in order to determine whether this is likely to succeed. Assessment financial supportThe Assessment financial support consists of a one-time support per applicant in the form of specific high-level expert consulting on a specific topic related to the applicant's digital and/or green transformation. The financial support covers up to 5 sessions with experts and the expected outcome is a documented report prepared by the applicant, supported by the expert, describing the maturity status and possible improvements. Assessment services funded under the FSTP must be conducted within three months from the date of award of the grant.Eligible applicants receive a financial support of maximum 4.000 € or 75% of the expert's bill for an assessment service, whichever is lower.The RESIST consortium offers in total 25 financial support assessment services. Feasibility financial supportFeasibility financial support provides support for theoretical, lab-environment study on feasibility of implementation of a new technology, new materials, or a new approach related to the applicant's services, products, manufacturing processes, or business models towards digital and sustainable transition. Market studies for international markets or new markets for applicants are also covered by the Feasibility financial supports. The outcome of this financial support can be, e.g., practical roadmaps, feasibility studies with technical specifications, new digitalised business models, other plans and arrangements for green/digital transformation, or market studies.The Feasibility service, funded under the FSTP, must be conducted within six months from the date of award of the grant.The implementation of the Assessment service or feasibility service, respectively, can start immediately after the bi-lateral contract is signed by all parties.

The funded activities must be documented by the beneficiary, supported by the expert, in form of an English publishable report (2-4 pages) that is one mandatory condition for the payment of the financial support.The RESIST Eurocluster expects to finance around 37 CMS (25 assessment services and 12 feasibility services).However, this figure could be lower, if the evaluators consider the applications received do not reach the minimum quality or are incoherent with the project requirements.

Although these areas are very distinct in terms of challenges, stakeholder communities and expected impacts, they have their cross-cutting nature as a unifying feature and are therefore grouped, if not addressed in other places of this work programme, under this Destination.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ 'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;D: Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions. It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for peopleAffordable and clean energySmart and sustainable transport The expected impact, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to the 'Clean and sustainable transition of the energy and transport sectors towards climate neutrality facilitated by innovative cross-cutting solutions”, notably through:Nurturing a world-class European research and innovation eco-system on batteries along the value chain based on sustainable pathways. It includes improvement of technological performance to increase application user attractiveness (in particular in terms of safety, cost, user convenience, fast charging and environmental footprint), in parallel supporting the creation of a competitive, circular, and sustainable European battery manufacturing value chain (more detailed information below).Nurturing the development of emerging technologies with high potential to enable zero-greenhouse gas and negative emissions in energy and transport (more detailed information below). A competitive and sustainable European battery value chainBatteries will enable the rollout of zero-emission mobility and renewable energy storage, contributing to the European Green Deal and supporting the UN SDGs by creating a vibrant, responsible and sustainable market. Besides climate neutrality, batteries also contribute to other UN SDGs directly and indirectly such as enabling of decentralized and off-grid energy solutions.The strategic pathway is, on the one hand, for Europe to rapidly regain technological competitiveness in order to capture a significant market share of the new and fast-growing rechargeable battery market, and, on the other hand, to invest in longer term research on future battery technologies to establish Europe's long term technological leadership and industrial competitivenessThe Partnership 'Towards a competitive European industrial battery value chain for stationary applications and e-mobility”, with as short name Batt4EU, to which all battery-related topics under this Destination will contribute, aims to establish world-leading sustainable and circular European battery value chain to drive transformation towards a carbon-neutral society.The main impacts to be generated by topics targeting the battery value chain under this Destination are:Increased global competitiveness of the European battery ecosystem through generated knowledge and leading-edge technologies in battery materials, cell design, manufacturing and recycling.Significant contribution to the policy needs of the European Green Deal through new solutions for circularity and recycling of batteries.Accelerated growth of innovative, competitive and sustainable battery manufacturing industry in Europe.Development of sustainable and safe technologies and systems for decarbonisation of transport and stationary applications.Contributing to the strategic independence of Europe through investigation of alternative battery chemistries using non-critical raw materials and efficient recycling technologies.Increasing synergies with other partnerships and initiatives. Emerging breakthrough technologies and climate solutionsAlthough the contribution of a wide range of technologies to reach climate neutrality is already foreseeable, EU R&I programming should also leave room for emerging and break-through technologies with a high potential to achieve climate neutrality. These technologies can play a significant role in reaching the EU's goal to become climate neutral by 2050.Relevant topics supported under this Destination complement the activities supported under Pillars I or III. They address emerging technologies that can enable the climate transition with a technology-neutral bottom-up approach. Research in this area is mostly technological in nature but should also, where relevant, be accompanied by assessments of environmental, social and economic impacts, by identification of regulatory needs, and by activities supporting the creation of value chains to build up new ecosystems of stakeholders working on breakthrough technologies.The main expected impacts to be generated by the topic targeting breakthrough technologies and climate solutions under this Destination are:Emergence of unanticipated technologies enabling emerging zero-greenhouse gas and negative emissions in energy and transport;Development of high-risk/high return technologies to enable a transition to a net greenhouse gas neutral European economy.

Scope:To ensure the safety of CCAM, it is essential that vehicles are not only safe during the (first) type approval, but also during their complete lifetime in a fast-changing road transport system. Changes can result from the evolution of the CCAM system itself, for example, as a result of increasing connectivity using V2X communication, the use of AI-based systems, and OTA (over-the-air) software updates. The traffic system, in which CCAM systems are being deployed, is changing at a rapid pace as well, with an increased market share of vehicles with higher levels of automation, new (personal) mobility devices and autonomous mobility robots (e.g., for package delivery). At the same time, the way CCAM systems interact with humans in traffic is changing. Until full automation in transport is reached, the human driver will keep on playing an essential role. Also, the interaction with other road users will change, supported by technologies that allow a CCAM system to communicate its intentions to other road users. As a consequence of these innovations and developments, the safe deployment of CCAM systems needs an extension of the safety validation procedures and certification schemes, taking advanced human-machine interaction and a continuous in-service monitoring approach into account. Due to the many different scenarios and variations that can occur realistically and that consequently need to be tested, it should be possible that a large part of the assessment is performed in a virtual simulation environment. The proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Developing a validation methodology for scenario-based safety assurance of AI-based CCAM functions. Trustworthiness of the AI-algorithms depends on how well the system responds to scenarios in its Operational Design Domain (ODD) - specificity and how it responds in case it ends-up outside its ODD - robustness. Consequently, methods need to be developed on the use of scenarios to describe the ODD of AI-based systems.Connectivity. Developing validation procedures for CCAM systems that rely on V2X for safety-critical functions i.e., the inclusion of the connectivity context. Ensuring aspects of reliability, trustworthiness and cyber-security with respect to V2X is essential. The approach to V2X connectivity is technology neutral.Continuous Safety Assurance approach. Developing an approach for a continuous safety validation methodology, to monitor the safety state of deployed CCAM systems in operation (real traffic) during its service life, following type approval. Performance metrics for the reliability of the monitored data, including cyber-security aspects, and indicators for the safety state should be proposed. Also needed is the development of requirements for the monitoring system for use in future standardisation, regarding the exchange of data and safety performance indicators with service organisations and authorities.Validating the virtual approach. Developing tools that ensure the relevant degree of detail and the appropriate representation of other road users' behaviour (incl. Vulnerable Road Users such as pedestrians and/or bicyclists) in virtual scenario-based testing. This includes methods to deal with perception, localisation, and world modelling errors in the validation procedures.Human Machine Interaction. Developing a safety assurance methodology that incorporates the assessment of Human Machine Interaction (both driver-vehicle and vehicle-road user) concepts for higher levels of automation (conformity checks as well as test set-ups with suitable metrics) ensuring safe communication between driver and vehicle and between vehicle and other road users, making Human Machine Interaction inclusive (i.e. in terms of age, mental and physical ability, cultural aspects, etc.). Proposed actions are expected to develop recommendations for harmonisation and standardisation and to feed into on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.Actions should be based on the outcomes of previous methodologies developed in HEADSTART[1], as well as research funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-02[2].Upcoming CCAM projects, in particular in the area of large-scale demonstrations, validation, digital infrastructure and key enabling technologies should be taken into account to ensure compatibility.Links should be established with the Mobility Data Space initiatives from Digital Europe, federated data infrastructure projects (Gaia-X, International Data Spaces, Big Data Value - BDV).

These management tools should be robust and able to address uncertainty due to uncertain technological developments, performances, services and business cases that go beyond what is available through current research results. Tools should support orchestration by, among others, integration of ad-hoc and manoeuvre coordination (SAE cooperation classes[7]), efficient route guidance and capacity aware demand management.Defining and demonstrating business and governance models (including for public actors) for the orchestration of traffic management in real-time CCAM traffic conditions in urban and motorway environment, allowing actors to address their needs on a win-win basis.Developing measures and KPIs to demonstrate the benefits and added value of orchestration for traffic management actions (in terms of traffic efficiency, energy efficiency, safety etc.).Demonstrating a process that ensures trust in the traffic orchestration scheme proposed as well as sufficient accessibility to quality data for all traffic actors involved and readiness for large-scale demonstration actions.

Interactions with AI-based vehicles are understandable, human-like and reflect human psychological capabilities. Scope:Today's mobility landscape is rapidly changing, as is seen in the recent boom in the detection of advanced and/or complex urban scenarios that add new challenges to the development of CCAM technologies. These novel scenarios are especially emerging with the establishment of new urban traffic regimes and cultures, such as restricted zones, shared zones, and cycle-streets, which need to be taken into account when designing and developing CCAM solutions.To integrate and tackle complex traffic scenarios, CCAM technologies will require highly advanced decision-making based on enhanced collective awareness - the stage beyond on-board perception, advancing on e.g. results from projects under CL5-2022-D6-01-05[1] - incorporating information from multiple sources and including interpretation for the aggregation of this information. Developing collective awareness should take into account the state of the vehicle, the driver and the road user environment. It can also involve the tracking of other road users' behaviour and generating predictions on a short horizon, which can be based on the input from advanced behavioural models, e.g. those developed within CL5-2022-D6-01-03[2] projects. The integration of these findings will lead to collective awareness for CCAM.The use of multiple sources (sensors and sensor fused information, maps, infrastructure, other road users, and localisation systems) and the sharing of the overall situational information and related intentions of the vehicle and that of its direct environment will be an important building block towards collective awareness. Eventually, in future work this can be incorporated in complex, self-organised bottom-up models of collective behaviour based on the change/modelling of individual interactions. Collective awareness should create a larger time window in safety critical situations and generate benefits for the overarching mobility system, which include efficient traffic management and improved traffic flow as it incorporates situation prediction capabilities and environmental benefits (which can eventually include e.g. smart charging strategies).AI is a key enabler to bring these increasing amounts of information together, with decision-making enabled both at vehicle level (including safety critical decisions) and at a mobility system level. In order to continue to define the role and limits of AI and of emerging new developments within AI, this topic recommends exploring Hybrid Intelligence (HI) as such a new subset of AI. Hybrid Intelligence is the process of developing and mobilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) to expand on human intelligence and expertise, thereby ensuring human-like control of CCAM operations. Applying an HI approach will allow CCAM technologies to integrate human expertise and intentionality into its decision-making in order to generate meaningful and appropriate actions that are aligned with ethical, legal and societal values. This will be essential to foster user acceptability, trust and adoption, especially when appropriate SSH expertise is included.Proposed R&I actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Methods to establish collective awareness of CCAM applications that are resilient to faulty sources, thereby ensuring safe operations. Guidance for failsafe designs should be developed.Methods to embed an HI approach in the entire action chain towards collective awareness (from basic perception to driving functions) to allow for seamless operation and real-time decision-making while enabling human-like control of CCAM applications by combining system and domain knowledge (of the vehicle and its technologies on one hand and of the transport environment including all the human interactions on the other, thereby understanding of potential risks and capabilities and needs of other road users). Tooling will be required to deliver situational awareness information in a structured way, based on multiple sources and in real-time. In addition, the development and integration of ethical goal functions to support collective awareness should be included. Work is expected to be based on: At least perception systems, sensor fusion, high-level world models/maps, vehicle positioning information. Guidance on common reference systems for positioning and time for synchronisation should be included in order to secure robustness and traceability.Relationships between the vehicle and forecasted intentions of other road users (e.g. a pedestrian crossing the street at a zebra crossing), as such including spatial temporal relation of elements in the driving-situation. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.Proposals should monitor and align relevant developments under this topic with on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on 'Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility' (CCAM).

Scope:A common basis for CCAM Knowledge in Europe is available today with the online CCAM Knowledge Base[2] which constitutes a one stop shop for all relevant R&I initiatives, tools, methodologies, regulations and standards in the field. Targeted content will be available for some stakeholder categories. The Knowledge Base should be expanded and further adapted to the needs of all relevant stakeholders. Results and lessons learned from the EU, national and international projects should be made available and accessible to targeted user groups. Proposed actions should in particular provide support for stakeholders to move into operations by identifying key building blocks and standards for deploying pilot services and enable capacity building for key actors of different use cases /applications domains as well as for citizens and non-experts on how to use CCAM systems and services and to become aware of new developments and related risks.The EU Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) developed in project 'FAME” funded under CL5-2021-D6-01-06[3] aims at becoming the basic methodology for all CCAM related evaluations to support collaboration, exchange and harmonisation. The methodology will need to be implemented for existing and innovative use cases by CCAM projects and aligned with national mobility strategies and approaches. Training programmes for CCAM projects will be necessary to integrate the methodology and to collect feedback on lessons learned during its implementation.A States Representatives Group (SRG)[4] has been created within the CCAM Partnership to ensure a continuous dialogue at European and national level for the sharing of information on CCAM R&I to increase coordination between European and national R&I funding schemes, and among national programmes. To carry out its mission efficiently, the SRG will need support to collect and analyse information on national R&I initiatives and to implement cooperation activities.To successfully contribute to the expected outcomes, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Ensure the maintenance and expansion of the Knowledge Base to support the CCAM stakeholder community and CCAM Partnership for the identification of future needs for R&I, testing and demonstration initiatives and for moving into operations (minimum block requirements, standards and common definitions to run pilot services across Europe). The content of the Knowledge Base should support the monitoring of the progress made on the targets and impacts set by the CCAM Partnership[5]. More specifically, the proposed action should regularly collect from the CCAM Partnership projects the data and information needed to track the KPIs set out in the CCAM SRIA[6], using a survey developed and maintained in agreement with the Partnership.Identify further needs for targeted content for specific stakeholder categories and in particular, develop content that is accessible to non-experts, thereby supporting capacity building of the general public. The proposed action should define the above-mentioned stakeholder categories, and develop a subsequent communication strategy (content, material, media, etc.) using realistic and accessible terms to address different target groups (including non-experts).Provide effective dissemination and concertation mechanisms and means for the stakeholder community (e.g., workshops, symposia, international cooperation, capacity building content for non-experts) and organise the EUCAD2027 event (as a conference with a side exhibition and demonstration site) together with the European Commission and the CCAM Partnership, to enable the exchange of experiences and practices, stimulate collaboration and cooperation between all CCAM stakeholders (including at international level) and reach consensus on challenges and future R&I needs within the thematic clusters of the Partnership.Facilitate the work of the CCAM SRG and stimulate the cooperation between EU Member States/Associated Countries for improved coordination of activities in the areas identified as priorities by the SRG.

Scope:Building on previously funded projects and ongoing activities (e.g. Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects), ensuring compliance with the data sharing framework pursued by the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), and taking into account the development of the common European mobility data space, proposals will pilot, demonstrate and scale up systemic collaborative solutions regarding logistics nodes, multimodal logistics networks connectivity, business and governance models. The focus will be on both digital and physical interoperability as well as on the adoption of zero-emission vehicles/vessels.Proposals will have to research and demonstrate in a structured and systemic way all of the following points:Demonstrate at least 10 working open standard processes, procedures and services across several logistics nodes providing seamless access to users. Processes, procedures, and services are expected to have an open access definition and scalability aspects need to be addressed.Develop and demonstrate further compatibility and interoperability of the full range of standardised multimodal transport units (from containers to boxes), also across transport modes.To achieve scalable multimodal logistics networks connectivity, demonstrate models and processes, supported by Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, etc., which can increase utilisation of assets and resources in actual logistics service providers' networks dynamically. These models should also consider how to increase the adoption of automated and zero-emission vehicles/vessels and the use of rail and inland waterways through multimodal solutions.Demonstrate tools, technologies and processes to achieve different types of flows compatibility (e.g. through shared standard boxes) and synchro-modal solutions over the logistics service providers' networks, involving shippers and retailers to that purpose.Demonstrate the benefit (e.g. GHG reductions vs increased operational costs) of decentralised inventory positions in the pooled logistics network allowing low speed multimodal transport for (re-)positioning stock levels and answering short term lead times with closer to consumer inventory positions (e.g. full visibility of inventory positions in retail networks extended to suppliers and logistics service providers).Test and demonstrate sound business and governance models and rules (including organisational change requirements) for resource-sharing across logistics networks, to ensure operational efficiency of freight movements irrespective of mode, nodal operations and freight characteristics.Test and demonstrate the functionalities and relevance of the data sharing framework, serving for optimisation of the logistic system, including through the establishment of an appropriate semantic model and its components, such as for instance Digital Twins with specific algorithms allowing for predictive planning of logistic related events. Synergies for rail will need to be sought with the EU-Rail Programme projects implementing the Transversal Topic on Digital enablers and Flagship Area 5[3].Develop and demonstrate scalability of the proposed solutions providing open access mechanisms and low thresholds to the system of logistics networks. Consider realising visualisation and simulation models and tools to show the practical use of collaborative models for the various types of stakeholders and the potential benefits based on actual cases. Develop specific actions to encourage, facilitate and ensure the access of SMEs and smaller players.Measure and demonstrate the benefits in terms of use of resources, affordability of proposed solutions, throughput capacity and environmental impact of the scaled up horizontal collaboration among logistics networks (system of logistics networks).

Scope:Increasingly, modern waterborne transport relies upon smart digital and connected systems to ensure safe and efficient operation. Within large complex vessels, system of systems approaches are used together with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence approaches to integrate diverse systems ranging from sensors, business and cargo management systems, power and engine management, electronic navigation and situational awareness. System integration of systems with proprietary digital control systems has become more and more critical in terms of ensuring safety and efficiency. The complexity and foundation upon software, makes assurance of the resilience of such systems challenging and requires a different to that applied to hardware- based systems. Waterborne digital system can be vulnerable to both malicious intervention and the consequences of system failure. Examples have included the spoofing of navigational GPS signals, ransom wear attacks on integrated container management systems, complete power shutdown and the helicopter evacuation of a large passenger ship when engine protection systems identified a common fault across all engine waterborne systems. The challenge to assure the safety and resilience of digital systems is particularly important within large complex vessels where the level of integration and connectivity is high and where the consequences of failure can be particularly severe.In the domain of power generation and management the vastness of new technological solutions, often driven by environmental regulations, poses new challenges in ships' design and management, where the need for integration of diverse energy converters (ICEs, batteries, fuel cells, wind, capacitors, etc.) confront designers and operators with systems based on profoundly different operating principles coming together with different requirements and control and digital systems. Integration for harnessing the full potential in a safe and secure frame is key to their implementation.Furthermore, the capability of integrating different systems (and their dynamics) involve an always increased number of sensors, whose data, fused, should become available for optimisation and increased awareness during normal and safe critical operations.Comprehensive HAZOP (Hazard Operability) studies are essential for such vessels, yet the methodologies are poorly established within the waterborne sector whilst other sectors operating safety critical digital systems (aerospace, nuclear, medical automotive etc.) have well established practices. Furthermore, applying 'hardware in the loop” to simulation and validation of digital systems in dependent on the quality of the digital simulation model. This can be difficult for waterborne transport due to the variability of ship designs, complexity and lack of relevant data concerning the integrated components. Pre-delivery testing and sea trials could include fault simulation and digital testing founded upon the identification of critical digital systems identified by the HAZOP, yet such trials focus on hard-ware or subsystems such as rudder control rather than addressing the entire integration. For safety critical systems, reliability regimes need to be established to identify the safe default state in case of system failure or the identification of malicious intervention. In this respect the best system state could be: 'fail operational”, 'fail soft”, 'fail safe”, 'fail secure”, 'fail passive”, 'be fault tolerant”.Activities will address the development of a HAZOP methodology for whole system assessment of highly digitised, connected complex vessels. The methodology should include system, system of systems designed for specific function or sets of functions and/or a methodology for the entire vessel, including when application of artificial intelligence algorithms is foreseen. The methodology will be developed with relevant stakeholders including shipbuilders, system designers and equipment providers, IT professionals, operators, class societies, regulators. The acceptability of the methodology to all stakeholders will be assessed and an implementation roadmap will be developed to account for any identified barriers. Work will draw upon the expertise of other sectors with more developed procedures for the assessment and assurance of digital safety.On-board systems and functions integration by design, for safe and secure operation should be used to test and demonstrate the safety and security of the applications.The developed methodology will be applied to a representative complex highly digitised vessel, safety critical systems and functions will be identified, and appropriate reliability regimes and mitigation measures will be established with consideration of both malicious intervention and system failure.Cost effective methodologies for validating the safety, resilience and correct functioning of digital and connected safety critical ship systems, including system of systems, will be developed and demonstrated.In case of validation on the basis of a theoretical digital models and/or digital twinning (e.g. hardware in the loop) then the validity of the model should be proven as well as its flexibility to be applied towards a range of vessel designs.In case of validation on the basis of physical testing of the responses of the final system to a range of fault conditions and malicious interventions during the final trials, there should be assurance that test conditions are representative of the identified risks. Guidance should be produced and disseminated concerning the recommended methodology for assuring the safety and resilience of complex digitalised and connected shipping.The safety assessment should be developed by using methodologies suitable for being assessed in international fora such as the International Maritime Organisation.

At the same time, novel forms of mobility (e.g. shared, micro-mobility or even hyperloop) and new services (e.g. Mobility as a Service) present new challenges, but also great opportunities for enhanced management and optimisation of the transport network. This includes advances to fully utilise dynamic and interoperable data exchange from multiple actors and transport modes, for well-tested and validated systems and operations, with appropriate governance arrangements in place.In this context, building on best practices (technological, non-technological and socio-economic), ongoing projects on multimodal network and traffic management, as well as other initiatives (e.g. the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum and the common European mobility data space), actions should address at least 6 of the following aspects:Developing and testing new generation multimodal, flexible, agile and adaptable, secure and resilient transport network and traffic management systems, leveraging state of the art technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, big data, edge computing, internet of things, blockchain).Assessing and simulating the effects on multimodal network and traffic management of new forms of mobility (e.g. zero-emission, connected and automated vehicles and vessels, car sharing/pooling, active-/micro-mobility, sustainable land/air transport modes and drones), as well as of innovative services (e.g. Mobility/Logistics as a Service), in different urban and rural environments, considering the socio-economic acceptability and different user needs (including vulnerable and gender groups).Performing simulations for network-wide optimisation of traffic models, aiming towards a 'social optimum” and an evaluation of mobility options for multimodal mobility and freight flows (including last-mile), enabling a modal shift to more sustainable modes (leveraging public transport), while addressing planned and unplanned events of mobility and freight systems under disruption.Demonstrating the collection, aggregation, analysis and use of network-wide data from infrastructures, vehicles/vessels and users (using ICT and EU satellite-based systems), from across transport modes (modal and intermodal data), stakeholders and national borders, while preserving data privacy, security and confidentiality to data providers, thereby enabling effective and intelligent multimodal network and traffic management, and even further data exchanges with other sectors (e.g. energy and telecoms).Performing early pilot activities on multimodal network and traffic management of limited scale in mobility hubs (e.g. rail nodes, maritime or inland ports), where cross-modal or hinterland inter-connections are present for passenger and freight traffic flows.Designing and testing innovative multimodal network and traffic management services, offered by public and/or private stakeholders, which can be operated at network centres (e.g. at cities or hubs) and/or at decentralised level (e.g. by users or vehicles/vessels themselves).Developing and showcasing workable governance and dynamic incentive models, for the effective engagement of public and private stakeholders in interoperable data exchange, in the optimisation of transport network and traffic management and in promoting a better use of (public) transport systems.

Providing concepts and policy recommendations sustainably integrating passenger and freight transportation in order to create a future proof holistic mobility system. Scope:Governance, policies and incentives play an important role in shaping transport and mobility systems and influence the development and implementation of different technologies and modes of transport (e.g. walking, cycling, public transport and rail). It is therefore important to study how policies and regulations could be best used to govern transport and mobility systems in desired directions, so that they become more sustainable and just, for instance with regard to gender, place, or low-income households, as well as their fiscal impacts.In addition, the COVID-19 crisis has significantly altered commuting habits; remote and telework have become widespread together with other flexible work arrangements. The true impact of these changes on gas emissions and on the well-being of people as well as on the real-estate market (offices) are not known. This is now an opportunity to leverage on an ongoing change in habits that could result in significant GHG reduction.Proposals should address all of the following aspects:Analyse the influence of politicians on the making of sustainable and non-sustainable transport policies, as well as the impact of their design on accessibility in peripheral areas, identifying synergies with the reform of governance instruments of the European Union (e.g. Trans-European Transport Network, Urban Mobility Framework) to enhance the gradual phase-out policy effect for private car ownership.Propose approaches that better integrate mobility policies with policies from other sectors (e.g. energy efficiency, renewables, gender mainstreaming, healthcare, retail and poverty and low income population reduction).Consider the benefits of public/private partnerships towards future transport and mobility system, as to secure local adjustment and solutions that are effective and economic for private stakeholders, with a long-term sustainable horizon for the society.Identify and assess the potential of (shared) mobility hubs at neighbourhood-level and define the role of organisational innovations in supporting them.Explore how small, medium cities and metropolitan areas manage the emergence of micro-mobility and how driverless vehicles are likely to affect urban areas and land use (e.g. mixed use of urban space, dynamic parking).Identify the major flaws on national transport and mobility regulations in EU countries and provide recommendations on how to better harmonize them trans-nationally (e.g. incentives for putting bicycles on trains etc.).Identify regulations and accountability measures to ensure that mobility data are best utilised for the common good, for example, harnessing the potential of data to stimulate innovation for more sustainable mobility behaviour patterns and guide urban planning, while also protecting citizen privacy.Analyse the drivers for public acceptability of stringent and mandatory transport policies (e.g. carbon taxes, urban traffic bans).Examine the most effective strategies in promoting the transition to more sustainable freight transport in Europe following the recent and ongoing changes in consumer culture, such as the increase in e-commerce and online. A 'social optimum' balance should be included to developing research knowledge within new governance models from several perspectives (e.g. socio-economic, environmental, health, accessibility, gender and inclusion, safety and security aspects). Synergies with the projects GECKO[3], ACCTING[4] and SHARED GREEN DEAL[5] should be explored, given that mobility behaviours and the role of cities as agent of change will influence policy makers in enabling adaptive and anticipatory regulatory schemes and governance with novel policies contributing to sustainable mobility goals.In addition to the research activities, actions are expected to involve citizens from different backgrounds and origins in the policy analysis to gather and study their understanding, perceptions, opinions and positions, thus contributing to co-designing and co-assessing the most appropriate policies' recommendations. Citizen platforms if existing, can be used for this purpose.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research. [1]Governance is all the processes of interactions be they through laws, norms, power or language of an organized society over a social system, done by the government of a state.[2]Policies are deliberate systems of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within a national or local authority.[3] https://h2020-gecko.eu/[4] https://www.esf.org/eu-projects/accting/[5] https://mailchi.mp/06ac151106cf/shared-green-deal",,"This Destination includes activities addressing safe and smart mobility services for passengers and goods.Europe needs to manage the transformation of supply-based transport into safe, resilient and sustainable transport and demand-driven, smart mobility services for passengers and goods.

Scope:The importance of a robust transport systems becomes highly evident in times of rapid, changes that are neither planned, scheduled nor predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic has pointed at several issues (e.g. delivery of essential goods, ensuring uninterrupted and safe public transport operations for essential workers etc.) that need to be addressed to secure future resilience of the transport system and to ensure that the level of transport safety is not only maintained, but also meeting more demanding targets. For instance, the decreased use of public transport during the pandemic has to some extent led to increases in both biking and walking, but also an increased use of cars in some parts of the world. At the same time, decreased traveling has meant fewer vehicles on the roads in certain areas, whereas others have seen an increase of delivery vehicles, as home deliveries have surged. Likewise, the current energy market realities have made even more pressing the need of an energy efficient mobility system that could absorb disruptions in the fuel supply chain.Digital tools/services and new transport means (e.g. urban air mobility and micro mobility), new ways how to use the infrastructure (e.g. even more shared spaces with different types of vehicles, both highly automated and manually controlled) in a more energy efficient manner and new behaviour should be included in the research.In order to provide safe and resilient transport for all, many aspects are expected to be considered in a clearly multidisciplinary approach. Proposed actions are expected to address at least three out of the following aspects:Scenarios of disruptive changes that can make a transport system unstable should be identified, the consequences on transport safety be analysed, and solutions to tackle them developed. This includes safety implications of rapid changes / new incentives (sometimes contradictory to previous ones, e.g. regarding the use of public transport in a pandemic situation).Analysis of how socio-economic differences may affect the safety of individuals in case of disruptive changes (e.g. individual mobility options are determined by the socio-economic status).Study of how the concept of resilience at the system level can be applied and used for the improvement of transport safety.Evaluation of the potential and development of recommendations on how to improve transport safety and resilience through suburban planning and future housing developments with their effects on the demand for transport and through the design of transport infrastructure networks. A definition of resilience in the context of transport systems should be provided, and factors of transport safety and energy efficiency that are essential to take into account should be determined. Moreover, scenarios for disruptive changes should be identified that can make a transport system instable, the consequences on transport safety be analysed, and solutions to tackle them be developed. Hence, a structured method to secure safety as an integrated part in resilient transport systems should be provided.A solid foundation for this research is the Safe System Approach.

Facilitation of a shift to increase efficiency in road safety related public spending across Europe together with a shift towards more energy efficient mobility choices.Development and evaluation of strategies to transform the traffic safety culture of road users and stakeholders based on a valid model that identifies the key components defining traffic safety culture, including, for example, social norms, attitudes, perceived control, values, and system assumptions (including its energy efficiency and consumption)Concepts and guidelines to make the concept of traffic safety culture an integral part of road safety work of actors across the socio-economic systems of European societiesBetter understanding of the link between road safety outcomes and safety culture; pilot implementation of road safety education at secondary school level and also for decision makers and practitioners in EU Member States/Associated countries. Scope:A Safe System entails the understanding and managing of all elements of the transport system, including the behaviour and interplay of its actors. Comparative analysis shows persistent differences in road safety performances between EU Member States/Associated countries. These differences may be attributable to differences in culture, which are hard to explain with classical risk models. Efforts should therefore be made to complement road safety initiatives by a safety culture perspective, i.e., the values, beliefs, priorities and viewpoints shared among groups of road users and stakeholders that influence their decisions to behave or act in ways that affect safety, while also considering energy consumption. This concept is already well established in organisational research.Assessing road safety cultures in different national, regional or local systems, groups and organisations is believed to help understanding and explaining different patterns of risk perception and risk taking across communities and countries - and can likewise inform tailored interventions for these (sub-)cultures, which all come with their specific norms, values, beliefs and behaviours (including gender-related behavioural patterns). These interventions should address all relevant actors in the system for road transport of people and goods, and consider future developments, such as potential impacts by increasing automation levels or by the introduction of new means of road transport such as e-scooters and hoverboards.Within this context, actions should contribute to establishing a framework for cultural transformation in road safety across the EU and thereby address all the following aspects:Better understanding of the link between road safety outcomes and safety culture, i.e. of sociocultural factors like values, beliefs, attitudes, and norms and their effects on actual behaviour of road users (including subjective perception of safety as well as implications of value of time and institutionalised travel costs) - and the ways how these factors can be sustainably transformed.Consideration in particular - but not exclusively - of traffic behaviour with high safety impacts, such as inadequate speed choice, distraction by communication or control devices, driving or riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs, non-use of protective devices, and risks triggered by professional drivers' requirements to multitask and report while driving.Assessment of safety cultures and respective activities from other transport modes such as aviation and rail and their potential for road safety.Assessment of the interplay between shifting to more energy efficient mobility solutions and traffic safety.Consideration of safety impacts of new technologies (including better understanding and use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)) and emerging transport means and services.Consideration of the safety impact of the increasing penetration of urban micro-mobility systems in mixed traffic scenarios and evaluation of potential safety improvements for the protection of micro-mobility users.Stocktaking of good practices from countries and companies worldwide already successfully applying cultural approaches to (road) safety work, including countries outside of the EU such as the US and Australia.Targeting all levels of the socio-economic systems of societies in the EU, i.e. from European to national, regional and local communities, including entities such as schools and workplaces. Also, NGOs, victims' organisations etc. can play an important role in that regard.Clear guidance & hands-on advice on the design and evaluation of interventions to define, measure, transform and institutionalise traffic safety culture across all areas affecting road safety - for decision-makers and practitioners, with a good geographic coverage across EU institutions, EU Member States/Associated countries. At the level of individual road users, including VRUs, such interventions may entail targeted educational and communication efforts to challenge wrong beliefs or to clarify misperceived social norms, and the use of incentives and nudging to encourage compliant behaviour. At the level of enterprises and authorities, initiatives may include the take-up of safety culture principles in sustainability reporting and encompass various activities from staff training and supervision to procurement and operations - at best permeating work culture and norms of an organisation. Advice at the level of EU Member States/Associated countries and the EU is sought on how to support such transformation such as with legislation, enforcement, and data.At least three different pilot tests of selected interventions at various levels in different EU Member States/Associated countries. Actions should be based on the results of previous research projects in this domain, such as the TraSaCu project, and make advances by completing and updating their theoretical foundations, teaming up with EU stakeholders and bringing their findings to life by establishing a framework for true cultural transformation in road safety both among stakeholders and road users. Making use of data that is already being collected in EU Member States/Associated countries about traffic safety culture such as the ESRA initiative (which already involves 60 countries, including over 20 European ones) and Baseline[1] project is strongly encouraged.Special attention should be given to EU countries with lower safety performance[2]. Integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) and international cooperation with partners from the US and/or Australia is encouraged.

A framework for cooperation will enhance the efforts to achieve this pan-European challenge by joining forces, sharing knowledge, bundling financial resources and coordinating activities, creating complementarities, coherence and building synergies across the EU (e.g. 2ZERO partnership) and EU Member States (MS) and Associated Countries (AC)´s R&I funding programmes, national plans, efforts, approaches and in collaboration with the Associated Countries.Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:Stronger harmonised national policy plans, efforts, approaches with a focus on R&I funding programmes of the different EU Member States/Associated countries, accelerating zero-emission road mobility.Maximally deployed and effectively utilised synergy effects, pooled resources and aligned R&I funding programmes to support the EU 2030 and 2050 CO2 emission goals for the road mobility sector in an affordable and effective way, in line with the scope of the National Emission Reduction Commitment Directive for all emissions and the Zero Pollution Action Plan.Exchange of knowledge and experiences and mutual coordination at multiple levels (EU/ national / regional / cities and stakeholders, funding organisations, OEMs, fleets, social partners, users, etc.), implementation activities, regulations, incentives and demonstrations and the sharing of data, information and best practices.Provide companies, regions, cities and the research community with a holistic overview of policy plans and R&I funding programmes across EU (and Associated Countries) to maximise synergy effects and the efficient utilisation of resources, such as from recovery packages and cohesion funds.Allow a clear overview of the national projects and better take into account their results in the development of their research and deployment actions.In order to facilitate the above-mentioned coordination of efforts at national and EU level and the sharing of best practices and results, data on national projects (to a level at least equivalent to those present in the CORDIS database) should be made available by EU Member States (MS) and Associated Countries (AC). The consortium will endeavour to promote and harmonise the registration of data on national projects of participating countries, to make data more accessible internationally and to facilitate their exchange and comparison. This will be supporting the integration of data on national projects into existing databases, such as TRIMIS and CORDIS.Long lasting, strong coordination and cooperation between the European Commission, MS and AC and the Stakeholders involved in the 2ZERO Partnership, facilitated by the States Representatives Group (SRG). Scope:Although there is a relatively large degree of similarity in the targets and approaches of the EU Member States and Associate Countries to address the climate change and air pollution targets, still considerable differences in the paths can be observed: more coordination and collaboration is urgently needed to promote zero emission road mobility, building on the policy cooperation network of the EU Member States/Associated countries built-up in ERA-NET Transport, Electromobility+ and ERA-NET Co-fund Electric Mobility Europe (EMEurope) with over two decades of experience.Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspectsAddress zero-emission road mobility for people and goods programmes supporting all phases of the innovation: technology development, demonstration, deployment and implementation will be considered.Develop a long-lasting network (beyond the project duration) of public and private stakeholders connecting EU Member States/Associated countries and European initiatives, under the umbrella of the 2ZERO partnership States Representative Group (also building on existing links with the supporting European technology platforms ALICE, ETIP-SNET, EPoSS, ERTRAC and Batteries Europe) to share knowledge, coordinate activities and bundling financial resources to achieve synchronicity, synergies and complementarity in the R&I-related plans, efforts, approaches, incentives and funding programmes to effectively support the EU and national objectives for 2030 and 2050.More concretely contribute to: Support EU Member States/Associated countries in fostering synergies with the national and regional funding and implementing and accelerating priority actions identified in the 2ZERO Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) in coordination with the 2ZERO States Representatives Group.Collect and share, up-to-date and targeted information on European and national R&I funding programmes, demonstration projects and testing activities, test sites, living labs with their features and capabilities, standards, testing and assessment methodologies as well as programmes in the field of zero emission mobility in Europe and beyond. Exchange knowledge and experiences on zero emission road transport programmes in Europe, building on and connecting existing database platforms, such as TRIMIS, 2ZERO events and conferences, including the H2020RTR series, Member State's and stakeholder's information sharing portals. Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC), whose contribution could consist of supporting the establishment of harmonized and shared national data on projects.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on 'Towards zero emission road transport' (2ZERO). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the European Partnership 'Towards zero emission road transport' (2ZERO) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.",,"This Destination includes activities addressing safe and smart mobility services for passengers and goods.Europe needs to manage the transformation of supply-based transport into safe, resilient and sustainable transport and demand-driven, smart mobility services for passengers and goods.

Development and adoption of new knowledge and innovations contributing to climate change mitigation by farmers is a priority to ensure that the objectives of the European Climate Law (climate-neutrality by 2050)[1], the EU zero pollution ambition[2] and the proposal for a nature restoration law[3] are met. Farming is also vulnerable to impacts of climate change; hence research and innovation into the adaptation possibilities is of utmost importance, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[4].Generating new knowledge and innovative climate-smart practices and mainstreaming their use has been recognised as a priority at the global level, including by the G-20. The project to be implemented is, therefore, expected to conduct research and innovation activities for climate-smart agriculture that contributes to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:The knowledge base of climate-smart farming practices is significantly expanded beyond the state of the art;Additional effective and innovative approaches for climate-smart agriculture in plant and animal production are developed and assessed in real conditions with all relevant actors involved;The widespread adoption by farmers of new knowledge, skills and innovative farming practices that mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (in particular CO2, methane and nitrous oxide), and that foster adaptation of the sector to climate change, is accelerated. Scope:The overall aim is to establish a three-level network in a phased manner over Cluster 6 work programmes 2021-2022 and 2023-2024. The first level is a network which engages front-runner farmers introducing on-farm trials and demonstration of climate-smart innovations, using existing knowledge (project 'Climate Farm Demo”). The second level is a network to connect all advisors on the subject in the Member States, building on achievements of Horizon 2020 projects, EIP-AGRI operational groups and the development of Member States' AKIS, to ensure the provision of targeted advice (project 'ClimateSmartAdvisors”). The third level of the network - the present topic - will engage and strengthen the capacity of experimental research stations and develop new knowledge and innovative solutions for climate-smart agriculture.Proposals should:Using a multi-actor approach, develop practice-oriented new knowledge, skills and innovations for adaptation to and/or mitigation of climate change in agriculture, taking into account a range of farming systems, land uses and pedo-climatic conditions across the EU and Associated Countries;Collect and compare tool-kits for assessing GHG balances at farm level, monitoring of performance in reducing emission, decision-support tools, climate services, etc. for possible use also on average farms;Systematically consider the synergies and trade-offs that exist between productivity, adaptation and mitigation, and between mitigation of different GHGs;Foster the role of ecosystems, where appropriate, in particular those with the most potential to capture and store carbon and to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters;Include a task and allocate adequate resources to closely collaborate with projects 'Climate Farm Demo” funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-04 and 'ClimateSmartAdvisors” funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-03, to test and assess the new knowledge and innovative solutions developed within the project in real conditions within the networks of pilot farms and of advisors, and to scientifically validate the contribution of practices emerging from those networks to the mitigation of or adaptation to climate change;Stimulate networking and collaboration between research stations and similarly focused research projects, including those funded under the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' and EJP SOIL, to avoid duplications and support cross-fertilisation between them;Foster knowledge exchange within and among Member States and regions, and establish links with EIP-AGRI stand of the EU CAP Network and Member States' AKIS networks and coordination bodies. The project should operate for at least four years and build on the outcomes of the climate-related projects from various funding sources.The project must implement the multi-actor approach and may involve social innovation.In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.

Achieving sustainable ocean, water and land management, and using natural resources efficiently to help mitigate climate change implies finding the right balance between productivity, climate, biodiversity and environmental goals in the agriculture and forestry sectors, with a long-term perspective. R&I activities will support solutions for climate and environmentally friendly practices to reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases, other pollutants and the environmental impact of ocean and land use changes and agricultural activities. R&I will rely on the application of digital technologies where relevant.The EU climate law[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&from=EN]] states that to reach 2030 and 2050 climate targets and to restore biodiversity, the EU needs to immediately and decisively restore and increase its natural carbon sinks. In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a communication on sustainable carbon cycles, including carbon farming and certification of carbon removals[[https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf]]. R&I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will help coordinate the research community and key stakeholders in developing, testing and demonstrating carbon farming practices and in certifying carbon removals. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&I on manure management will help implement the EU methane strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf]]. R&I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest as a natural and man-made carbon sink and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the Fit for 55 package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new EU forest strategy.Strengthening the nexus between the ocean and climate change is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture. Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the ocean and climate change.Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the EU Arctic policy; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on sustainable blue economy and its offshoot initiatives as well as implementing the Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives; and iii) helping to achieve the clean planet for all's aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.In line with the climate adaptation strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.In the area of forestry, R&I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.R&I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[ This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].Expected impactsProposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to climate action on land - including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;advancement of science and technology to support the adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;increased climate change mitigation in the primary sectors, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining natural and man-made carbon sinks and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;improved capacity to climate change of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;sustainable management of scarce resources, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.

Projects should also help creating a channel of communication with the EU level to report on the state of the civic space in their countries and voice their concerns.More specifically, projects could create a systematic and comprehensive monitoring system to regularly and consistently monitor the environment in which civil society organisations work in the national contexts, building on the Fundamental Rights Agency indicators about the shrinking civic space and of internal organisations' data, and in particular of breaches of civil society organisations and human rights defenders' fundamental rights.Projects could also support and enhance the protection of civil society organisations, their members and human rights defenders working to protect and promote EU values under attack, including by facilitating access to dedicated support services. As such, they could also contribute to strengthening the resilience of civil society actors against attacks, including cyber threats, and their capacity to fully exploit the possibilities of the converged media to carry out effective, visible and impactful advocacy activities in the digital environment.Transnational partnerships with mutual learning possibilities for partners in several EU Member States are particularly encouraged to apply, as well as networks of relevant actors at national level such as National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), equality bodies, Ombuds-institutions, and the national Charter Focal Points.",,,,,

Hatred affects the individual victims and the groups they belong to, generates societal polarisation and silences wide sectors of the population, weakening pluralism and undermining respectful public democratic debates. The online world has amplified the negative effects of hate speech. Hate crimes are a direct violation of the victims' fundamental right to dignity, to equality and non-discrimination. Combating hate speech and hate crime is therefore a key part of the Commission's action to promote EU values and to ensure that the Charter is upheld.At EU level, the 2008 Council Framework Decision requires the criminalisation of certain forms of hate speech and hate crimes. Also, the Commission adopted a Communication in December 2021 inviting the Council of the European Union to extend the legal basis for EU-level criminalisation to other forms of hate speech and hate crime beyond the racist and xenophobic grounds already covered by the Framework Decision.Recently, the EU is experiencing an alarming increase in hate speech and hate crime, including physical and online attacks targeting in particular the Jewish and Muslim communities in Europe. The Joint Communication on 'No Place for Hate” confirms a strong commitment to step up EU efforts to fight hatred in all its forms, by reinforcing action across a variety of policies.As recognised by the Communication, civil society organisations play a crucial role in combating hate speech and hate crime, thereby safeguarding and promoting fundamental rights. Projects under this priority should aim to enable civil society organisations to establish mechanisms of cooperation with public authorities in particular to support the reporting and recording of episodes of hate crime and hate speech; to ensure support to victims of hate speech and hate crime; and to support law enforcement, including through training or data collection methodologies and tools. Projects should also focus on activities to tackle hate speech online, including reporting content to IT companies, designing countering narrative and awareness raising campaigns, and educational activities to address the societal challenges of hate speech online.",,,,,

In this context, the support and assistance to victims provided by civil society organisations, NHRIs and equality bodies and Ombuds-institutions is instrumental.Projects under this priority should, through training, knowledge sharing and exchange of good practices, strengthen the knowledge and ability of civil society organisations and human rights defenders as well as of practitioners, legal professionals and independent human rights bodies, to effectively engage in litigation practices at national and European level and to improve access to justice and enforcement of rights under EU law, including the Charter.Projects under this priority can also include a focus on countering manifestly unfounded or abusive court proceedings against journalists and human rights defenders who engage in public participation (Strategic lawsuits against public participation).",,,,,

Businesses are one of the key contributors to the clean energy transition. However, many homeowners, building owners or small businesses lack the skills and capacity to set-up, implement and finance complex and ambitious clean energy transition projects. In addition, many project developers face high implementation costs, given the relatively small size of the investments and the lack of turnkey solutions, and have limited access to adequate and attractive financing solutions on the market.This topic aims at supporting the creation or replication of One-Stop-Shops, proposing integrated services for clean energy transition in buildings and businesses.Proposals submitted under this topic (depending on the specific scope) are expected to tackle, but are not limited to, the following aspects:1. Improve market conditions and develop integrated building renovation service offers to:Reduce complexity, simplify decision making and stimulate demand for investment in energy performance improvements and decarbonisation.Connect all relevant actors in the value chain (e.g. construction companies, architects, engineers, urban planners, financers, etc.).Streamline access to various support measures, especially where there is support for specific target groups (e.g. energy poor households).Improve awareness and trust towards such integrated services, through clear accountability, quality assurance and/or dedicated consumer protection policies.Develop a robust pipeline of investments in building renovations, able to increase interest and participation from financial institutions and exploit synergies on the market, for instance via the development of dedicated financial products for building renovations mediated by One-Stop-Shops. 2. Provide methods and support:Implemented, operationalise and test integrated services.Build expertise and organisational innovations needed for project development.Reduce costs and time on-site through standardised approaches (e.g. optimised business processes, standardised contractual arrangements, branding of the proposed services, district approaches, etc.).Ensure cost effectiveness and price transparency of services provided to final beneficiaries. 3. Aim at a self-sustained business model taking into account that:Integration of services can be developed through dedicated operators and/or through an improved co-ordination between existing local actors.The prospect of economically viable business models is expected, targeting self-sustainability in the medium to long term, i.e. ultimately running without subsidies to cover running costs. 4. Communicate results:Disseminate innovative solutions (e.g. organisational and contractual), suited to the targeted contexts.Help improve legal and regulatory environments. communicating project results to competent authorities and bodies.Demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across the EU. Proposals should be well integrated in their local and national context, making best use of what is locally available, notably in terms of local market conditions and public support schemes, and contribute to develop partnerships between local authorities and the relevant market players, in the construction, heating and cooling, and wider energy sectors. The targeted territories and/or sector should be clearly identified and justified, notably segmenting and quantifying the potential target users, and a first detailed concept of the services should be presented in the proposal. Scope:Based on the generic approach and common objectives presented above, proposals submitted under this topic are expected to focus on one of the three specific scopes below. The scope addressed should be specified in the introduction of the proposal. Although this does not exclude the possibility of addressing, in addition, some aspects of the other scopes, proposals must be fully clear on what the core focus of the approach is, and who the main final beneficiaries will be.Scope A: Integrated Home Renovation ServicesUnder Scope A, actions should clearly focus on the energy efficient renovation of existing single or multi-family buildings in the private residential sector. Actions in ""complex buildings"" (e.g. coexistence of owner-occupied and rented housing; coexistence of private and social housing; coexistence of housing and business premises, typically on the ground floor; etc.) may be included in this scope. Specific approaches to deal with subsets of the residential sector (e.g. focus on condominiums, focus on energy poor households, etc.) are also welcome, as long as the main focus is on private non-professional homeowners (including homeowners' associations in the condominium sector).Beyond the common objectives presented above, the proposals presented under this scope should meet the following specific objectives:The services developed under Scope A should cover the whole ""customer journey"" of the homeowners aiming to renovate their home. Dedicated structures (legal entities or consortia of organisations) should provide integrated home renovation services, with the explicit intention of delivering services that belong in the competitive sector. In particular, proposals are expected to provide proactive support to homeowners ranging from technical design, obtention of permits, selection of qualified professionals, contracting of works, structuring and/or provision of finance (e.g. loans), to the supervision of contractors to carry out the renovation works and quality assurance. Those services can be implemented by public or private entities, either on a not-for-profit or for-profit basis. Proposals addressing only the provision of generic information and diagnosis, and/or limited to internet platforms without on-site interaction are not within the scope. Proposals covering regions with low development of integrated home renovation services to date will be given higher priority.Scope B: Integrated services for private rental housing energy upgradeUnder Scope B, actions should clearly focus on the energy performance improvement of existing buildings owned by private professional entities operating under private law, with a core focus on rental housing. Examples of stakeholders that could be targeted by the services developed under Scope B are, among others: housing companies, housing cooperatives, real-estate investors, property managers (on behalf of multi-owner households or real estate investors), building administrators, non-profit organisations, etc.Beyond the common objectives presented above, the proposals presented under this scope should meet the following specific objectives:The type of integrated solutions developed must be particularly tailored to the specificities of rental housing in the local context, especially from a real estate portfolio management and asset valuation perspective. Services developed under Scope B should not be limited to first level information and generic diagnosis, but should also address: the development of strategic partnerships with construction companies and/or financial institutions (notably in the context of the EU taxonomy regulation, see 2020/852/EU); the development of dedicated financial and/or fiscal schemes; the development of a sustainable business model. Proposals should also pay particular attention to governance issues, e.g. developing a framework to facilitate decisions and conflict resolution among co-owners, or developing a framework so that tenants can participate in decisions and partly share risks and benefits, etc. Proposals addressing only the provision of generic information and diagnosis, and/or limited to internet platforms without on-site interaction are not within the scope.Proposals under Scopes A and B may be submitted by a single applicant from a single eligible country.For Scopes A and B, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Expected Impact:Proposals submitted under this topic should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.Proposals should demonstrate how they will contribute (depending on the specific scope) to:Integrated services implemented, operational and tested at the end of the action. Projects should necessarily set up and launch the services on a pilot phase, although upscale may happen after project completion.Strong and trustworthy partnerships with local actors (e.g. SMEs, architects, engineers, ESCOs, financial institutions, chambers of commerce, professional federations and networks, local and regional authorities, energy agencies, NGOs).Prospect of economically viable business models, in the medium to long-term running without the need for public subsidies to cover running costs.Increased awareness and trust of end-users through clear accountability, quality assurance and/or dedicated consumer protection mechanisms.Data and guidance made publicly available in order to facilitate replication of the approach by other market actors. Evidence that the value of the services offered is recognised by the market. Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project.The indicators for this topic include (depending on the specific scope):Number of initial contacts (households, private companies) made by the integrated service provider.Number of investment projects effectively implemented (number of housing units).Average conversion rate of initial contacts into effective investments, demonstrating the value of the services offered.Investments in building energy renovation triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).Average percentage of energy savings per investment project. All proposals submitted under this topic should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme:Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year). Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).",,,,,

Projects under this topic are expected to develop replicable solutions that are mobilising private capital, blending public with private financing, setting up long-term and scalable financial instruments and at the same time overcoming legal and structural barriers. Projects shall demonstrate an innovative approach, for example in advancing existing procurement procedures, in aggregating and structuring investment projects, in advancing market boundaries, improving organisational and regulatory structures or in achieving high levels of energy savings and ultimately decarbonisation.PDA projects contribute significantly to the European Green Deal goals[1] and will help pave the way for a decarbonised and clean energy system. In the next years, PDA actions are expected to significantly contribute to accelerating the clean energy transition, as pointed out in the REPowerEU plan[2] to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuel imports, and to contribute to the Green Deal Investment Plan[3], by stimulating market demand for Net-Zero technologies and assisting in their uptake. A range of very innovative solutions with regard to the financing and mobilisation of investments were demonstrated in past PDA projects (e.g. under Horizon 2020), which helped to shift market boundaries and demonstrate practical application of inspiring solutions. Examples include the development of a revolving loan fund combining European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding, low interest-loans and third-party financing through Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to deeply refurbish hospitals in a region, the development of a forfaiting fund using private investments[4], or the development of sustainable public real estate management and subsequent energy efficiency investments in municipal assets[5]. PDA projects can also help to implement investment concepts developed under the European City Facility.PDA projects are expected to mobilise private investments and increase cost-effectiveness of national and Union public budgetary resources by developing ready-to-finance and bankable projects. Scope:Project Development Assistance (PDA) will support project promoters in preparing and launching investment pipelines of sustainable energy projects.

LIFE-2024-CET-BETTERRENO,"Energy Performance of Buildings - Making renovation faster, deeper, smarter, service- and data-driven",LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,6000000,6000000,,46900460,46900425LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"Objective:This topic contributes to the goals of the EU Renovation Wave strategy[1] and aims to help implement current and future buildings policies, notably in view of the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), but considering as well aspects of the New European Bauhaus initiative[1]. This topic addresses several areas that are key for the achievement of the ambitious EU targets for the decarbonisation of buildings. It aims to develop and deploy approaches that bring actors, markets, frameworks and innovative solutions together to increase the attractiveness of building performance up-grades and to reduce the administrative, logistic and financial burden that still goes along with (deep) retrofitting of buildings. The topic also aims to address the need for quality data to make verification and financing more robust and to help deploy services that valorise building energy efficiency and smartness. Proposals should, where appropriate, explore synergies, while linking to, building on, complementing or promoting the market uptake of results from projects funded under other EU programmes, notably Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. Proposals are expected to focus on one of the two scopes (A or B) established below. In their introduction, proposals should clearly identify one scope against which the proposal shall be evaluated. In case a proposal addresses elements of more than one scope, this should be duly justified. Scope:Scope A: Facilitating large-scale deep renovation Actions under Scope A should stimulate volume and demand of deep renovation, by aggregating demand and deploying business models for district level deep renovation projects, by rolling out tools such as building renovation passports or by improving coordination of small and medium actors in the supply chain.The topic welcomes action in all markets regardless of their readiness or maturity, and in particular in less mature markets.Proposals should explain and adapt the proposed activities to the context in which they will be acting.Applicants are referred to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive which provides legal definitions for concepts such as 'deep renovation”, 'staged deep renovation” or 'zero emissions building”. Besides energy efficiency upgrades and the switch to sustainable energy sources, proposals should consider Indoor Environmental Quality[3] (IEQ) and comfort aspects.Proposals should address at least one of the following areas/aspects: Remove market barriers and stimulate the development of business models for the implementation of large-scale deep renovation projects, e.g. at district or neighbourhood level. Proposals should make the whole renovation process easier and more attractive for all those involved, from construction stakeholders and investors to building owners and occupants. Proposals should facilitate demand mobilisation and aggregation and the links between supply and demand, e.g. interaction between building owners, managers and suppliers. Proposals should not focus on technology and/or material development, but on rolling-out market-ready technology and packages and targeting building segments or typologies that would allow for a fast and large-scale deployment. Proposals can also address standardisation of building renovation solutions and circularity-related aspects where relevant. Proposals can address the roll out of materials and solutions that improve energy efficiency and wellbeing in buildings, including industrialised prefabrication and modular solutions or other solutions, considering also circular and bio-based materials. Proposals should seek to reduce construction costs, time on site for renovations, to reduce material use and the impact of potential supply-side disruptions, to improve carbon footprint and whole life cycle emissions, and to increase circularity. On top of technical solutions, business models, financing solutions, performance guarantees, design and procurement processes should be taken into account.Roll out renovation passports for buildings. This is a tool introduced by the recast of the EPBD, to equip building owners planning a staged renovation of their buildings. Renovation passports provide a clear strategy for staged renovation with the objective to transform the building into a zero-emission building by 2050, helping owners and investors plan the best timing and scope for the interventions, and linking to finance and funding schemes. As indicated in the revised EPBD, Member States will have to introduce a scheme of renovation passports, in order to give their citizens access to the use of this tool. Therefore, proposals should follow the evolutions in the territories where they will be working and align with the EU and national frameworks where available. The interrelation of this tool with other building related instruments should be considered, i.e. energy performance certificates and digital building logbooks. Proposals should also coordinate with existing support and funding schemes and one-stop-shops or renovation support services for homeowners in their area of action.Remove barriers linked to the lack of coordination between the different actors and trades involved in the supply side of renovation works (in particular SMEs and individual craftspeople), and the capacity needed in the sector to deliver the 'Renovation Wave” objectives. Actions should incentivise collaboration and result in the establishment of partnerships and consortia able to deliver business models and long-lasting collaboration models between MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) which effectively reach the building and homeowners and enable deep renovations with guarantees (including the switch to efficient renewable-based heating and cooling), reducing risks and transaction costs for companies. This could include standardising contractual aspects, e.g. liabilities in case of low quality work, putting together different trades and/or training them to deliver joint quotes and work together on projects for deep renovation, ensuring a more robust information sharing between companies, showcasing integrated offers for deep renovations to potential customers, etc. These activities could be linked to the services provided by one stop shops for renovation, marketplaces, or other facilitation structures. Proposals should also integrate aspects related to quality and guarantees, giving confidence to present and future customers, including for example potential linkage of performance guarantees to payments and procedures for post-completion evaluation of works to integrate lessons learnt. Proposals should ensure uptake of the results in the targeted local, regional and/or national markets, and for the sub-sector of the building stock tackled, for example through the involvement of professional organisations/associations and/or other relevant stakeholders. Scope B: Buildings energy data and services Actions are expected to improve the availability, quality and accuracy of buildings data and the access to these for multiple usages and parties including financial institutions and data aggregators; they are moreover expected to explore and foster the use of data for the development and financing of services that enhance the energy performance of buildings and the efficiency of the system. Actions may also develop and deploy approaches for use of better data to improve the reliability and consistency of key instruments, such as Energy Performance Certificates.Technological, including innovative, solutions may be employed as enablers but must not be at the centre of the action.Actions should address for example one or more of the following areas/aspects:Develop methodologies that make the collection and structuring of data more robust and contribute to the systematic integration and use of conventional and metered data including, where relevant, big data. This includes innovative methods and tools to measure and/or estimate and/or calculate energy performance and energy savings, facilitate financing of energy renovation and roll-out of energy services. This could also address non-energy benefits, notably health, wellbeing and productivity through the improvement of Indoor Environmental Quality.As established in the recast of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), help improve the access of building owners, tenants and building managers to buildings data; help improve access of third parties, notably financial institutions, and service providers such as Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) and aggregators, to buildings data, e.g. by supporting evolutions of national regulations related to energy data access.Develop, implement and roll-out approaches that use metered data and integrated data collection/processing for Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) towards a) improving the accuracy and reliability of EPCs and/or b) enhancing the market uptake of EPCs; this includes for example actions that help link the rating of EPCs and the improvement of the rating to the value of a building in view of potential investments; c) factoring in new aspects to be reflected in EPCs, such as Indoor Environmental Quality and related elements.Promote and support the use of innovative technologies and digital tools for inspections, notably following constructions and renovations.Support the coordination across initiatives and projects in the area of buildings, buildings policies and buildings data, including promoting the collaboration and communication towards projects and activities for which building policies and data are an essential element.Support the establishment, and manage the operation of, an agile market-based community of data providers for the EU Building Stock Observatory, seeking to involve all relevant sectors and (private and public) players; define and implement an effective set-up to perform extensive and long-lasting data collection from the community, in cooperation with the EU BSO, in view of maximising the continuous expansion of the EU BSO database.Integrate tools and platforms that would contribute to the coordination and harmonisation of data models, methodologies and standards for the energy performance of buildings.Develop services that make use of actual energy consumption data, metered savings and measured flexibility provided by active buildings, building on and contributing to the Smart Readiness Indicator (SRI) testing and implementation in EU Member States, and explore the contribution of active buildings to the efficiency and stability of the energy system, in particular from large tertiary buildings. For actions specifically providing support for national authorities in contributing to the EU BSO, please refer to topic LIFE-2024-CET-POLICY.For all Scopes, proposals must be submitted by at least 3 applicants (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) from 3 different eligible countries.For all Scopes, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Expected Impact:Proposals submitted under this topic should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts (depending on the scope). This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts. For Scope A: Proposals submitted under Scope A should demonstrate how they will contribute to the following impacts, depending on the area addressed: Development of business models for the implementation of large-scale deep renovation projects allowing to reduce costs and time-on-site. Roll out of renovation passports for buildings. Improved coordination between the different actors and trades involved in the supply side of renovation works (in particular SMEs and individual craftspeople). Effective and replicable solutions leading to increased rates of renovation. Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for Scope A, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project. The indicators for Scope A include: Increased renovation rates. Increased deep renovation rates. Number of deep renovations with reduced costs. Number of buildings equipped with a renovation passport. Number of companies benefiting from improved coordination for deep renovation projects. For Scope B:Proposals submitted under Scope B should demonstrate how they will contribute to the following impacts: Improved availability, quality and accuracy of buildings data. Improved access to and use of buildings performance data by financial institutions, service providers and building owners/operators, e.g. to deploy innovative financing schemes and/ or dedicated financial products. Improved reliability and consistency of Energy Performance Certificates; increased up-take of EPCs in the market, including stronger consideration in the valorisation of buildings and building portfolios. Better quality and cost-effectiveness of inspections and of the assessment procedures carried out for the Energy Performance Certificate. Up-take of improved methodologies to measure and monetise primary benefits and co-benefits of innovative services, such as environmental and health externalities. Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project. The indicators for Scope B include: Number of methodologies and interoperable data models taken up by stakeholders, including market and public/ policy-relevant stakeholders. Number of references evidencing the use of improved buildings data by market and public/policy-relevant stakeholders. Number of third parties, including financial institutions and energy service companies, benefitting from access to building performance data.

Number of innovative inspection procedures and tools developed, tested and/or deployed. Number of consumers (residential, commercial, public) offering or benefitting from new and smart service offers. Proposals under Scopes A and B should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme: Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year.Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year).Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).

LIFE-2024-CET-HEATPUMPS,Supporting the roll-out of high-quality heat pump installations,LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,5750000,5750000,,46900460,46900440LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"Objective:Heat pumps represent one of the key technologies to meet the 2030 EU energy and climate targets and towards the climate neutrality of heating and cooling by mid-century. As part of the REPowerEU[1] Plan to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuels imports the European Commission has called for 10 million additional heat pumps installed within 5 years. While market growth of 2021 and 2022 alone - cumulatively amounting to slightly below 5 million new units - is already overshooting on this aspiration, it is becoming increasingly clear that the present market deployment alone will be insufficient to deliver a profound transformation of the heating sector in view of delivering in line with the Fit-for-55 target and beyond. Furthermore, through the Net-Zero Industry Act[2] which is part of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the European Commission is aiming at increasing the manufacturing capacity of strategic net-zero technologies to meet at least 40% of the EU's annual deployment needs by 2030.In this framework, the aim of this topic is to strengthen the enabling framework for the accelerated roll-out of high-quality heat pumps, complementing existing legislative and financial incentives at the EU, national and local levels. In particular, the topic aims to accelerate the deployment of heat pumps in existing buildings through alternative business and delivery models as well as in industrial sectors through a closer collaboration between different industrial sectors and industrial heat pump technology providers. Scope:Proposals should address only one of the two scopes below. The scope addressed should be clearly specified in the proposal's introduction.Scope A: Alternative business and delivery models Proposals should stimulate large-scale demand for heat pumps in existing buildings, while significantly reducing or spreading over several years the initial costs for product acquisition and installation.To that end, the proposed actions should develop, demonstrate, upscale and/or replicate alternative business and/or heat delivery models.For the purpose of this topic, business and delivery models refer to the arrangements between the involved parties and their roles involving a defined set of relationships, responsibilities and rights, including arrangements about equipment ownership and payment.Proposals should ensure that installations are of high quality, that the selected buildings are suitable and ready (e.g. in terms of thermal insulation, internal distribution systems) for a heat pump prior to any installation, and that building heating needs and heat pump size are properly evaluated. To that end, proposals may apply innovative methods/tools simplifying processes and assessments.Proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness and replicability of the proposed approaches.The focus of the proposed actions should be at least on space heating; however, this does not preclude considering additional functions such as water heating and space cooling. Actions may address any type of buildings, although multi‐apartment and commercial buildings are especially encouraged. Synergies of heat pumps with PV installations and/or hybrid renewable heating and cooling systems could also be promoted.Heat pumps should be designed and installed by professionals with relevant qualifications and skills. All relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved; if not directly involved, their support should be demonstrated in the proposal.In this context, proposals may put in place new or strengthen existing strategic partnerships between relevant stakeholders (e.g. industry, installers, local authorities, consumer associations, integrated home renovation services) and consider the objective of the European Commission's Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age of strengthening, among others, the heat pump supply chain within the EU[3].The proposed actions are invited to build on experiences and lessons learned from other relevant projects and programmes[4].Scope B: Collaboration between industrial sectors and industrial heat pump technology providers Proposals under this scope should promote a sustainable and efficient use of energy in at least one industrial sector by bridging the gap between users and providers of industrial heat pump solutions. Most notably, proposals should facilitate the collaboration between industrial sectors/sub-sectors sharing similar processes and energy related needs with heat pump manufacturers and providers. On the user side, specific industrial sectors could survey their sector's processes to define an 'average' process and reassess its operational energy needs in a most cost-effective way through a closer exchange with technology suppliers in order to effectively design sustainable energy solutions. On the provider side, manufacturers and providers of industrial heat pumps could optimise and standardise their existing technological offer, products and solutions to meet the industrial sector needs.This aligned cooperation for creating demand and ensuring supply would benefit certain industrial sectors progress in their path towards decarbonisation. The goal is to move from custom-built project by project approach for each specific industrial plant and process, to more streamlined, standardised, turn-key solutions for industrial sector(s) and/or processes with similar energy needs.Proposals are expected to facilitate the establishment of concrete collaboration initiatives, proving optimisation and integration of industrial heat pump solutions in industrial processes. Activities should include not only the assessment and optimisation of technical aspects but also the creation and exchange of knowledge and expertise, including guidelines on how to deploy the solutions, and the development and validation of business models for the deployment of the specific solutions explored in the sector(s) addressed.Proposals should ensure dissemination and replication of the proposed approaches for wide deployment, including advising and building capacity among the relevant actors and initiatives as well as identify and map possible synergies with relevant funding instruments at regional, national and European level that could help build, disseminate, and exploit knowledge and results.Involvement of the relevant user sector(s) and of technology provider representatives is recommended for effective market acceptance and implementation.Proposals should focus on existing technologies already available on the market. Activities aiming at technological and first deployment on the market, including for products at Technology Readiness Level 8, are not in the scope of this topic.For both scopes, proposals must be submitted by at least 3 applicants (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) from 3 different eligible countries.For Scopes A and B, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Expected Impact:Proposals should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.For Scope A proposals should demonstrate how they will tackle the high-upfront costs of heat pumps in existing buildings through alternative business and delivery models. For Scope B the aim is to accelerate the deployment of industrial heat pump solutions in industrial sectors by developing standardised approaches.Proposals under Scope A and B should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project.The indicators for this topic include:Number of new installations of heat pumps triggered by the action (including commitments).Number of key actors along the value chains with improved skills/knowledge during the action.Number of new customers benefitting from alternative business and delivery models.Number of standardised solutions to implement heat pumps in industrial processes.Natural gas savings triggered by the project (in million cubic meters/year), where appropriate. Proposals should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme:Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year).Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).

This is particularly needed for small and medium municipalities, rural and isolated areas, and carbon-intensive regions - which might also benefit from previous successful experience and know-how of frontrunners on similar challenges.Delivering the energy transition in a holistic manner requires LRAs to put in place an integrated approach to implement sustainable energy actions, ensuring a strong political commitment, the allocation of clear responsibilities and the identification of appropriate resources and financing opportunities. This could be supported by robust and long-lasting organisational structures, with the aim of mainstreaming the carbon neutrality goal within all relevant sectors (energy production and consumption, buildings, district heating and cooling, mobility and transport, land-use, waste, water, health, etc.), mutually reinforcing sectoral policies and accelerating on the implementation. These new or existing structures could include, for instance, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral teams within the LRAs and should facilitate timely and relevant dialogue and collaboration with other governance levels and key stakeholders.Actions should consider potential synergies and cooperation with complementary EU initiatives addressing the role of LRAs in the clean energy transition, notably the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the Clean Energy for EU Islands Initiative [8], the Horizon Europe Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission [9], ManagEnergy [10], BUILD UP Skills [11], and other potentially relevant initiatives. Existing technical assistance and private financing support initiatives such as the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) Facility [12], LIFE CET Project Development Assistance (PDA), Smart Cities Marketplace [13], the EU City Facility [14] should also be taken into account in view of accessing dedicated support for financing the implementation of sustainable energy actions foreseen under the local and regional CET plans. Scope:Actions should provide technical support to a significant number of LRAs, depending on the targeted context, and build their capacities to deliver and implement ambitious short and medium-term CET plans and strategies for 2030 - with a potential to pave the way for the 2050 carbon neutrality goal - in coherence with the EU energy and climate targets and relevant policies and initiatives.The focus should be on delivering the right mix of activities that will build/increase lasting technical, legal, financial, administrative and social innovation skills among LRAs with a clear aim to initiate the implementation of sustainable energy actions with an integrated approach in their constituencies.Proposals should address one or more of the following bullet points, provided the proposed activities are relevant and coherent. Addressing more than one point does not necessarily increase the relevance of the proposal.Deliver extensive and in-depth capacity building programmes for policy-makers and public officers on the implementation of CET plans and actions. Capacity buildings programmes should be of scale, ambitious in terms of number of trained participants and volume and depth of the training offer, with lasting effects and tailored to specific needs and national languages, as appropriate.Develop and pilot blueprints and integrated approaches that help municipalities develop and streamline actionable heating and cooling plans which align with the carbon neutrality goal and other sectoral policies. Bundle efforts at regional or other appropriate levels to provide support services for municipalities on this theme. Facilitate dialogue with relevant stakeholders, citizens and various governance levels including national authorities.Establish and/or enhance organisational structures to mainstream the carbon neutrality goal and coordinate the implementation and monitoring of integrated clean energy transition plans and facilitate effective exchanges among different governance levels and active engagement of public and private stakeholders, including citizens and/or communities.

In order to meet the required level of investments, it is necessary to progressively maximise the mobilisation of private capital, using public funds as a catalyst, and to put in place an enabling regulatory framework. This has been at the heart of the works of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG)[3] and will remain a central objective of the recently established European Energy Efficiency Financing Coalition[4]. In addition, the revised Energy Efficiency Directive and Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aim to increase the cost-effectiveness of public funding and the mobilisation of private investments in energy efficiency measures, including by promoting innovative financing mechanisms. National Energy and Climate Plans provide a solid framework for Member States to evaluate and report on investment needs and gaps to achieve their 2030 national energy and climate targets, including regarding the mobilisation of private investments. The Smart Cities Marketplace offers an investor matchmaking platform for investments in clean energy, ICT solutions and sustainable mobility.While significant public sector expenditure is allocated to leverage private finance for energy efficiency and small-scale renewables (e.g. through the InvestEU facility), most private investors still view this type of investments as risky, complex and/or insufficiently profitable. This is due to the limited availability of investment opportunities which comply with the requirements of financial institutions in terms of size, scale, standardisation and transaction costs. There is a need to set up and roll-out private financing schemes which can be expanded and/or replicated at scale, and contribute to the national strategies to achieve the 2030 energy efficiency targets and the building renovation policy objectives. These schemes have to be adapted to the specificities of energy efficiency investment profiles, as well as those of small-scale renewables, in buildings, SMEs, district heating and other relevant sectors.The financing schemes can be initiated by private sector stakeholders or local and regional authorities, as well as other types of actors. Scope:Proposals should clearly focus on tailored, market-oriented solutions to crowd in private finance at scale for sustainable energy investments, understood as investments in energy efficiency and/or small-scale renewable energy sources and storage.Proposals should set-up innovative financing schemes leveraging private finance for sustainable energy investments, with a dedicated and clear focus on energy efficiency, in at least 1 eligible country with a clear ambition and effort towards expansion in additional eligible countries. The financing scheme should be operational by the end of the project, whereas the related investments may be implemented after project completion.The financing schemes can involve, for example, but are not limited to:Equity, debt, mezzanine financing, potentially combined with non-reimbursable grants ('blending”).Local or regional investment funds, including blended financing. Guarantees, risk-sharing, insurances or other de-risking instruments.Energy services such as energy performance contracting, efficiency as a service, and variants thereof, if used to finance the investments.On-bill, on-tax and building-based financing, where the debt is attached to the energy meter or the building rather than the household or company.Schemes complementing, with a dedicated financing component, already existing local and regional technical assistance facilities, in particular integrated home renovation services.Schemes targeting the secondary market, including refinancing mechanisms, specialised securitisation vehicles and green bond schemes.Local investment structures, including citizen financing (e.g. crowdfunding) for energy efficiency.Market-based instruments relevant for sustainable energy (e.g. carbon finance instruments, energy efficiency obligations, etc.).Brokering, aggregation or clearing houses, which facilitate matching of demand and supply of sustainable energy finance. Proposals should take into account all the following elements:Establish an innovative, operational financing scheme for energy efficiency and/or integrated renewables in at least 1 eligible country. Proposals can build on and/or upscale innovative financing schemes successfully tested previously[5].Address the provision of finance as well as the structuring of demand, in particular at regional and national level.Define the target region(s) and sector(s) and justify how the proposed scheme is innovative and complements available funding schemes.Clearly demonstrate the business case and financial viability of the proposed scheme (including e.g. market analysis, investment sizes targeted, transaction and management costs, expected energy/cost savings and other returns, etc.).Plan replication and/or rollout of the scheme envisaged beyond the region(s) targeted for the establishment, including the analysis of legal and market conditions for replication. Proposals should demonstrate support of the targeted stakeholder groups and present in a detailed manner how they will be involved throughout the project. For actions addressing innovative financing schemes focused specifically on heat pumps, please refer to topic LIFE-2024-CET-HEATPUMPS. Proposals must be submitted by at least 3 applicants (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) from 3 different eligible countries.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.

Evaluating the impacts of EU Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Regulations following these standards can lead to overestimations, as pointed out in the 2020 European Court of Auditors ecodesign and energy labelling audit[1].To address this, the topic aims to improve understanding of the actual impacts of EU Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Regulations and facilitate the implementation of related test methods that reflect better product use in real life, in terms of energy consumption and, when appropriate, pollutant emissions. In addition, actual energy consumption data would inform on the one hand future reviews of ecodesign and energy labelling rules, while providing added value for preparatory studies. On the other hand, it would also contribute to improving the ecodesign impact accounting model[2] utilised for reporting the impacts of these rules. Scope:Proposals should set-up and implement in-situ measurement campaigns to capture the actual energy consumption, or energy efficiency where relevant, in EU households and to better understand the determinants of energy use for the selected products. Data collected should be statistically analysed and policy recommendations formulated on the related EU ecodesign and energy labelling rules. Proposals should build on relevant studies, including on the recommendations from the recent JRC technical report[3].The following aspects should be taken into account for the measurement campaigns:Product selection: while multi-product monitoring would be preferable, an appropriate balance should be sought between the number of samples, geographical focus and the range of products selected. Priority should be placed on products which are simple to measure and relevant for policymaking, including displays, household refrigerators and cooking appliances, considering also their expected overall energy consumption;Sample and geographic focus: a representative sample and a good geographical spread among EU Member States (ideally representing over 70% of EU households) should be ensured; depending on the products selected, different climatic zones, socio-economic, cultural, and other aspects should be considered;Duration: should be decided based on relevant criteria, including the intrusive character of testing from the household's perspective, the effect of seasonality on products considered, cost/benefit, the possibility to rotate monitoring among households etc.;Determinants influencing energy use of the selected products should be investigated (e.g. thermostat settings of a refrigerator, functions aiming to optimise consumption) and other relevant data should be collected, such as the model identifier, energy class and corresponding product information (e.g. information sheet, technical documentation), as applicable. Consideration could also be given to registering user patterns/ significant user interactions and observations in a logbook (e.g. refrigerator door-openings). Particular attention should be paid to ensuring a sufficient household engagement and retention, including to factors that could influence this, such as the type of products selected (e.g. plug-in domestic appliances compared to other products requiring expert installation), data protection issues etc.Proposals should involve a consortium with multidisciplinary expertise and resources, including on technical aspects (e.g. installing equipment, with remote accessibility, and capacity to tackle on-site issues, such as malfunctions), household engagement, statistical evaluation. Monitoring instruments of adequate precision should be installed, but the use of existing and embedded meters would be also possible, if their precision is known or can be established.Relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved, including consumer organisations at the European or national level. Access to experts with technical knowledge on the concerned products, regulations and standards as well as the wider legal framework will be necessary.Proposals must be submitted by at least 3 applicants (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) from 3 different eligible countries. The Commission considers that proposals requesting an EU contribution of up to EUR 2 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.The Commission intends to select one single proposal under this topic. Expected Impact:Proposals submitted under this topic should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.Specifically, proposals submitted under this topic should demonstrate how they will contribute to understanding better the actual impacts of EU Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Regulations.Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic when they are relevant for the proposed activities.

SAPs are a flexible tool available to support actions from key commercial and non-commercial actors of the EU energy transition, which includes entities from all sectors (public, non-governmental and private). They are preferably close-to-market (i.e. aimed not only at delivering improved clean energy solutions, but also at making sure such solutions are widely taken up by society in general and, more particularly, by the economy through an explicit market-oriented approach). In this case, applicants will be required to highlight specific market-related information in their application (e.g. planned production capacity, reference market, economic feasibility etc.).Actions under this topic should contribute to the implementation of the EU's energy efficiency and renewable energy policy and legislation and demonstrate their positive contribution to the overall clean and fair energy transition.This topic aims to support actions from key commercial and non-commercial actors in the clean energy transition, involving in particular local and regional authorities, energy agencies, energy service companies (ESCOs), financial institutions and EU manufacturers of net-zero energy technologies. Scope:The focus of the actions under this Call should address one of the following areas:Support local and regional authorities in establishing new energy agencies to support the delivery of the clean energy transition on the ground, including synergies with other areas addressed by the LIFE Programme and contributing to a carbon neutral future;Support energy service companies (ESCOs) in piloting and rolling-out ambitious investment and financial solutions for deep energy renovation of buildings, such as EnPC or similar contractual arrangements.Support financial institutions, brokers, insurers and other actors involved in the energy financing areas, as well as public-private partnerships, in developing and marketing financial products and solutions to finance investments in energy efficiency and integrated renewables.Support EU manufacturers of net-zero energy technologies to roll-out innovative techniques, including activities such as the identification of needs for regulatory updates where relevant (e.g. regulatory sandboxes), along with fostering collaboration with all actors in the value-chains to increase the market uptake and large-scale deployment of their clean energy solutions in line with the Green Deal Industrial Plan and the Net-Zero Industry Act. Proposals should address one of the above listed points. Addressing more than one point does not increase the relevance of the proposal.Actions should provide the right mix of activities that will ensure their sustainability and replicability after LIFE CET support.Proposals may be submitted by a single applicant from a single eligible country.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.

In that context, in particular modern and efficient district heating systems can connect local demand with low-temperature renewable and waste energy sources, as well as the wider electric and gas grids, thereby contributing to the optimisation of supply and demand across energy carriers.The REPowerEU Plan, the revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED)[1] set out ambitious measures, including the increase of the share of renewable energy and waste heat in district heating systems, and how to facilitate the achievement of efficient district and cooling networks. District heating and/or cooling operators/owners need to prepare and implement plans so that existing systems fulfil the criteria for ""efficient district heating and cooling"", defined in the EED. This will require, among other aspects, the integration of low-temperature renewable energy (e.g. from solar thermal, ambient energy and geothermal resources) and waste heat as well as the cost-effective and energy efficient retrofitting of existing, inefficient district heating networks. Furthermore, district heating has been identified as a key option for the decarbonisation of the heating sector in countries and regions without long tradition and experience in the technology.The option to further develop district heating and cooling systems should be integrated in energy planning and heat mapping by public administrations, taking a district approach when addressing the policy priority of deploying renewable and efficient heating and cooling, including for instance building or modernising district heating systems when planning renovation programmes.Guidance, recommendations and technical advisory services have already been developed and tested at the national and local levels. Notwithstanding, a large share of existing district heating and cooling systems still overly rely on fossil fuels. Additionally, the switch to low-temperature renewable energy and waste heat and the development of new systems in emerging markets is hampered, among other factors by limited human, technical and financial capacities. Technical support and enabling frameworks are therefore needed to support the preparation of modernisation and development projects. Scope:Proposals are expected to work eitherwith operators/owners of existing district heating systems and provide them with the required technical support for the preparation of investment plans for the fuel switch of existing district heating systems to fulfil the criteria for ""efficient district heating and cooling"" as defined in the Energy Efficiency Directive. This can include the extension of existing district heating and cooling networks provided that they are fully based on low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat; orwith municipalities or relevant key stakeholders in the development of investment plans for new district heating and/or cooling networks, provided that they are fully based on low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat, and with particular attention to existing buildings. The focus should be on identifying and offering concrete ways to integrate low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat as defined in the revised Renewable Energy Directive.The investment plans to be developed should include the technical part and detailed identification of the investments, their timing, the internal and external resources required, the public and private funding sources, in particular for the first tranches of investments and the potential identification of alternative funding sources and models. Activities should include, among others, financial planning and pre-feasibility studies including, where relevant, the assessment of the compatibility with the existing building stock and options to link district heating retrofitting to local building renovation plans.The investment plans to be produced should enable the targeted district heating system to fulfil the criteria for 'efficient district heating and cooling” as specified in the Energy Efficiency Directive Recast within a timeline of 10 years. However, the transformation into low-temperature of the district heating networks is not compulsory and other feasible approaches enabling the fuel switch to low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat are possible.Proposals should support the development of a substantial number of investment plans in at least 3 eligible countries. Proposals should demonstrate, in a clear and convincing way, the commitment of operators/owners of the district heating networks that will be targeted for the collaboration, explain the content of the support to be provided and how the consortium will deliver this support on the ground. Additionally, proposals should engage and involve required stakeholders, in particular potential waste heat suppliers, work closely with the potential customers, provide an adequate risk assessment, identify barriers, provide recommendations for regulatory bodies, inputs for local administrations for the preparation of the local heating and cooling plans and promote replication through other district heating operators/owners.Proposals under this scope are not expected to finance the equipment or development of new tools (e.g. software, or the upgrade of existing ones, platforms, applicants are encouraged to make use of existing commercial software, as needed).In line with the Renewable Energy Directive, actions may also include the assessment of the potential to participate in electricity markets by providing balancing, storage and other flexibility services.Proposals must be submitted by at least 3 applicants (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) from 3 different eligible countries. The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Expected Impact:Proposals submitted under this topic should demonstrate the impact of the supplied investments plans and guidance on the transition towards 'efficient district heating and cooling” networks, and on integration of low-temperature renewable energy and waste heat. The expected results together with a detailed analysis of the starting point, with a set of well-substantiated assumptions, with clear links between the results, should be given in the proposal. Proposals should demonstrate how they will contribute to equip district heating and/or cooling operators and/or local authorities and other key stakeholders with investment plans, guidance, internal capacity and other elements which are required to either build new systems or to meet the criteria defined for 'efficient district heating and cooling”, encouraging potential waste heat suppliers to consider becoming heat suppliers to district heating. Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project. The indicators for this topic include: Number of investment plans for existing or new district heating and/or cooling systems, allowing them to fulfil the criteria for 'efficient district heating and cooling” defined in the Energy Efficiency Directive. Number of follower cases (DH companies) selected during the project life for which transfer of knowledge was effectively provided. Number of local and regional authorities integrating the outcomes of the project in their energy planning. Investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources triggered by the implementation of the investment plans developed thanks to the project (cumulative, in million Euro). Proposals should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme: Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year).Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).

LIFE-2024-CET-RENOPUB,Facilitation structures for the renovation of public buildings,LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,3500000,3500000,,46900460,46900400LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"Objective:The public sector plays a key role in delivering the energy transition, with a unique mandate over their public assets and a unique convening power on actors across the value chain. The European Green Deal's Renovation Wave[1] aims to double the renovation rate of buildings by 2030, which requires also massive investment into the public building stock. In line with the REPowerEU plan[2] to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuel imports, the public sector is called to play a key role in reducing its energy consumption through building renovations. The revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)[3] requires the public sector at local, regional and national levels to reduce their total final energy consumption by 1.9% annually and to renovate at least 3% of the total floor area of their heated and/or cooled buildings annually, which should be transformed into at least nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB) or zero-emission buildings (ZEB).Currently, a substantial barrier to increased renovation rates in the public sector is to create and sustain in the long-term the financial and technical capacity amongst public authorities to develop projects. In particular, small and medium-sized municipalities often do not have sufficient resources to dedicate staff towards developing a project pipeline.The challenge remains to upscale renovations of public buildings to nZEB or ZEB standards and to demonstrate the exemplary role of the public authorities in decarbonising their assets and leading the way towards the European clean energy transition. Hence, facilitation structures (e.g. one-stop-shops or similar) are needed at regional and national levels that can support a larger number of public project promoters in designing and delivering ambitious renovation projects in the public sector at scale and capitalising on existing solutions. The experience from the technical assistance facilities (ELENA, H2020 PDA, eee-f) has shown that a range of competences are needed in public project promoters to bring sustainable energy projects alive, namely expertise in technical aspects (energy audits, project design), financial engineering (Energy Performance Contracts, blending different finance sources) and legal aspects (bundling, pooling, procurement, applying Energy Performance Contracts). Scope:Proposals should establish and operate regional/national facilitation structures, for example one-stop-shops, to accelerate the renovation wave in the public sector (e.g. office buildings, social housing, schools, leisure facilities etc.) covering a larger territory and offering to public authorities a comprehensive, all-inclusive service from technical, financial to legal advice, procurement and quality assurance of works.Actions should clearly focus on the ambitious energy renovation of existing public buildings (e.g. administrative buildings, hospitals, schools) to nZEB or ZEB standards, and should target legal entities operating under public law (e.g. public authorities, public bodies, social/public rental housing operators, etc.) as the main final beneficiaries of the services to be put in place.Proposals should describe the services that will be developed and offered to public authorities, which should include:Reduction of complexity and simplified decision making for public authorities to stimulate demand for building renovation and energy performance improvements.Proactive outreach to public authorities and identification of public buildings for energy renovations.Renovation of buildings to nZEB and ZEB standards in line with the revised EED.Provision of legal assistance to facilitate and prioritise the aggregation of building renovation projects (belonging to one or several public entities) with the aim to upscale overall renovation and attract private investors.Development of efficient procurement processes ensuring that renovations are delivered at pace, enabling the bundling/upscaling of renovation projects and ensuring high quality of renovation works as well as facilitating the use of energy performance contracting and third-party financing mechanisms on a long-term contractual basis.Financial engineering support to facilitate the use of financial instruments and market-based instruments such as Energy Performance Contracts, refinancing models, Green/White Certificates, energy efficiency obligation schemes, energy efficiency as a service, and to increase blended finance of public and private sources and uptake of EU funding sources such as InvestEU, Recovery and Resilient Facility and EU Cohesion Policy funds including REACT-EU and Just Transition Mechanism.Systematic collection, aggregation and assessment of energy related public buildings data for informing local, regional or national policy developments and reporting. Proposals should clearly describe how they will achieve long-term sustainability of the facilitation structure. For example, this could include a clear outline of a sustainability strategy, business plan and/or dedicated tasks in the proposed work plan to that effect.Proposals may be submitted by a single applicant or by applicants from a single eligible country.The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a range of EUR 1 million to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts. Expected Impact:Proposals submitted under this topic should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.Proposals should result in long-term facilitation structures which are tested, implemented and operational at the end of the action, i.e. delivering renovation projects to nZEB and ZEB standards.Proposals should quantify their impacts using the indicators listed below, where relevant, as well as other project-specific performance indicators:Number of public buildings renovated to nZEB or ZEB standards targeted through the facilitation structures.Average percentage of energy savings per investment project.Number of public authorities supported through the services of the facilitation structures.Additional amount of funding support (EU and/or private sources) leveraged into the territory thanks to facilitation services.Number of jobs directly and indirectly created. All proposals submitted under this topic should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme:Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO2-eq/year).Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro). The impacts of the proposals should be demonstrated during the project and within 5 years after the project lifetime.

CERV-2024-CHAR-LITI-CHARTER,Capacity building and awareness raising on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights,CERV-PJG CERV Project Grants,CERV Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-23T00:00:00,2024-09-18T17:00:00,,16000000,16000000,,46904303,46904287CERVProjectGrants1713830400000,"Scope:Capacity building and awareness raising on the EU Charter of Fundamental RightsThe Charter Strategy underlines the importance of strengthening the application of the Charter in the Member States, through awareness raising and capacity building initiatives. Accordingly, projects under this priority are intended to raise the fundamental rights knowledge of relevant actors. Building on the central role of civil society organisations and human rights defenders, funded projects could involve national, regional and local authorities as partners (co-applicants), with the aim of supporting joint capacity building and awareness raising efforts.The projects funded under this priority could address the capacity building and awareness raising needs on the Charter in general, or they could focus on one or several of the topics below:• Rights enshrined in the Charter and awareness of the Charter's scope of application. In accordance with its Article 51, the Charter is applicable to Member States only when they are implementing EU law. Given the specific scope of application of this instrument, unlike that of international human rights agreements, and considering the increasing number of references to the Charter in the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU, there is a specific need to promote an understanding of when the Charter applies, i.e. when EU law is being implemented, and of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter. Relevant projects could therefore focus on the scope of application of the Charter and/or on the contents of an individual Charter right and/or several rights.• Protecting fundamental rights in the digital age. To follow up on the Annual Charter Report 2021 on fundamental rights in the digital age, the aim of the priority is to protect fundamental rights by strengthening accountability for the use of automation where rights are at stake. This includes approaches for addressing and combatting bias and multiple/intersectional discrimination based on gender and on other grounds including ethnic and racial origin, caused or intensified by the use of artificial intelligence systems. Projects could aim to develop guidelines (including measures that ensure gender sensitive implementation), technical benchmarks and tools, including for algorithm-audits. Projects are expected to develop a concrete tool or a benchmark process in an area of the applicant's choice with demonstrated relevance for fundamental rights, without prescribing the area or the type of the tool (e.g. it could be software, a benchmark data set, a simulation environment, a procedure).",,,,,

It contributes to the achievement of the EU4Health Programme's general objective of protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination among the Member States to cope with serious cross-border threats to health (Article 3, point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522. Scope:This action aims to diversify and advance the pipeline of BSA candidates. More specifically, it will support the development and further characterisation of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting identified HERA priority viral families, which largely can be divided among respiratory RNA viral families, such as Paramyxo-, Orthomyxo and Coronaviridae, as well as those targeting viral families known for causing viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), such as Arena-, Bunya-, Flavi-, Filoviridae. The action aims to identify a potent BSA candidate, in order to advance its clinical development. A robust pipeline should contain multiple BSA candidates for each viral family that are developed in parallel. When selecting the BSA candidate, attention will be paid to the complementarity with existing Horizon Europe projects.The proposal would need to cover early safety and efficacy trials for testing new or improved anti-viral therapeutics, with a clear regulatory and clinical pathway, including first in humans.Innovative delivery systems and suitable safety profiles for broad use should be considered when possible as well as the application of novel approaches and widely applicable workflows (e.g. artificial intelligence) for rapid and reliable identification of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapeutics. Expected Impact:HERA's threat assessment of 2022 included a vulnerability analysis with regard to the availability or absence of medical countermeasures, in particular the availability of vaccines and treatment options. Given that the large majority of identified virus families lack effective vaccines and/or effective therapeutics at the EU and global levels, HERA's long-term aim is to, inter alia, support the creation of a diverse portfolio of BSAs and BCCs that can be further developed in clinical by identifying most promising candidates and supporting their characterisation and assessment, including through clinical trials. Actions funded under this topic are therefore expected to either bring innovative, emerging, and cutting-edge elements with significant economic potential to the internal market or to reduce or prevent strategic dependencies of the Union, including by contributing to the Union's technological leadership in the innovation and development of BSA and enhancing the access to these products in the EU.",,,,,

They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees[2] recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.Supervisory BoardEach MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.Training activitiesMSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training[3]. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).SupervisionParticular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.Career Development PlanA Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.

Scope:Scope: The nuclear and radiation protection sector demands a consistently high level of diverse skills[1], and is experiencing challenges to attract the younger generation. Possible gaps in human resources and skills could become critical when considering the importance of the sector in EU Member States.In this context, the Commission is offering funding through a coordination and support action for a long-term, industry-, research- and training-led public & private initiative to maintain and further develop the skills necessary to ensure the availability of high-level expertise for the safe use of current and future nuclear technologies in the EU. This initiative will prepare a strategy to identify and quantify nuclear skills shortages across the EU, drawing on approaches from different industries (such as the MATCH programme[2]), the European Human Resources Observatory for the Nuclear Sector (EHRO-N) and Member States, in particular building upon the work already initiated in job taxonomy and national workforce assessments under EHRO-N.Overall, the proposed strategy should contribute to maintaining the highest levels of nuclear safety and radiation protection. Achieving this objective requires the strategy to also cover aspects relevant to the recently established SMR Industrial Alliance. The initiative's strategy and multi-annual action plan should consider increasing (i) activities across sectors and Member States, (ii) collaboration and transnational mobility and (iii) vocational training programmes and should identify the reskilling and upskilling needs of job holders in the sector (identification, validation and certification of skills), including access to nuclear research facilities.Additionally, the strategy should identify ways to promote nuclear and radiation protection careers and job paths among young people and with teachers, instructors and professors. At the same time it should improve diversity, inclusion and gender representation in the nuclear sector (fission and fusion), including by sustaining in its current form the existing European Masters in the nuclear and engineering field (i.e. organised and delivered by academics in at least three Member States).The proposed project will benefit from past and current education and training efforts under various programmes and instruments (cf. Euratom Research and Training Programme, Erasmus+, EIT, Instrument for Nuclear Safety, Pact for Skills[3], SAMIRA Action Plan[4]), carried out by national service providers, the JRC and the European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN). It will also draw on best practice from various industries and countries.The consortium will involve a wide variety of stakeholders, from industry, research and training organisations, as well as academia, regulatory bodies and professionals from the fields of education and human resources management.The initiative should leverage existing EU instruments where appropriate, including the Pact for Skills. The feasibility of the proposed strategy should be demonstrated by a pilot action implemented by the consortium during the lifetime of the project.

Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps after the research project.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.",,"Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing carbon sinks in primary production and natural systems as well as in harvested wood products and other carbon storage products are key components of the European Green Deal[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN]]. Achieving sustainable ocean, water and land management, and using natural resources efficiently to help mitigate climate change implies finding the right balance between productivity, climate, biodiversity and environmental goals in the agriculture and forestry sectors, with a long-term perspective. R&I activities will support solutions for climate and environmentally friendly practices to reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases, other pollutants and the environmental impact of ocean and land use changes and agricultural activities. R&I will rely on the application of digital technologies where relevant.The EU climate law[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&from=EN]] states that to reach 2030 and 2050 climate targets and to restore biodiversity, the EU needs to immediately and decisively restore and increase its natural carbon sinks. In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a communication on sustainable carbon cycles, including carbon farming and certification of carbon removals[[https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf]]. R&I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will help coordinate the research community and key stakeholders in developing, testing and demonstrating carbon farming practices and in certifying carbon removals. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&I on manure management will help implement the EU methane strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf]]. R&I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest as a natural and man-made carbon sink and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the Fit for 55 package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new EU forest strategy.Strengthening the nexus between the ocean and climate change is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture. Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the ocean and climate change.Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the EU Arctic policy; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on sustainable blue economy and its offshoot initiatives as well as implementing the Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives; and iii) helping to achieve the clean planet for all's aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.In line with the climate adaptation strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.In the area of forestry, R&I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.R&I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[ This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].Expected impactsProposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to climate action on land - including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;advancement of science and technology to support the adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;increased climate change mitigation in the primary sectors, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining natural and man-made carbon sinks and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;improved capacity to climate change of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;sustainable management of scarce resources, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.

HORIZON-EURATOM-2024-NRT-01-01,European Fusion Industry Platform and preparation for a Public-Private Partnership on Fusion Energy,EURATOM-CSA EURATOM Coordination and Support Actions,EURATOM Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-05-28T00:00:00,2024-09-17T17:00:00,,1500000,1500000,1,47011859,47011845EURATOMCoordinationandSupportActions1716854400000,"ExpectedOutcome:the action is expected to prepare for a potential future Public-Private Partnership (PPP) on Fusion Energy, in the form of a European co-programmed partnership, by:establishing an industry-led European association, representing the European fusion industry and relevant fusion-related technology centres and research organisations, which could possibly evolve into a long-term European Technology and Innovation Platform;laying down a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Fusion Energy,meeting other relevant requirements, such as drafting a memorandum of understanding with provision for managing intellectual property and technology transfer. Scope:The Commission aims to support and incentivise the European fusion community and industry and to act decisively to strengthen and deploy the EU's technological leadership and expertise in this field. This will ensure the EU's strategic autonomy and competitiveness for the future commercial deployment of fusion energy.The EU has a world-leading industrial capability in mainstream magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). The know-how in the construction and assembly of tokamaks and stellarators has primarily been developed through involvement in ITER and other publicly funded devices either via F4E or EUROfusion.However, large-size EU industries have been mainly involved as suppliers rather than R&D partners. There is also a significant risk that the engineering fusion know-how and industrial potential could be lost and migrate to other countries with a more favourable economic and regulatory landscape.In this context, the Commission aims to engage the EU fusion industry to tackle the critical bottlenecks that need to be addressed to design a first viable and cost-effective fusion power plant. This will ensure that EU industry masters and exploits the relevant technologies and consolidates the range of components and processes needed to establish a competitive EU value supply chain, also in connection to the completion of ITER construction and its operation. At the same time, in addition to the current mainstream MCF approach, the Commission intends to support innovation in alternative fusion concepts and in the development of key enabling technologies to address specific technical and industrial challenges.Fusion is one of the most ambitious engineering feats and will require the integration of knowledge and expertise from several different fields and stakeholders. Neither the public nor the private sector acting alone will be able to successfully tackle this challenge. For this reason, it is necessary to create a new collaborative environment in the form of a PPP.This action will provide key support to a representative stakeholder consortium. This consortium will act as a single-entry point managing activities towards the development of a potential future PPP. The action will, in particular:identify and create, in an inclusive manner, a stakeholder network bringing together industry (including supply chain, startups, energy providers and investors), technology centres, academia and research organisations (including EUROfusion and the Joint Undertaking 'Fusion for Energy');support the creation of an organisation (entity with legal personality) which is expected to become the lead organisation in the potential future PPP;put in place the legal and financial arrangements required to ensure the sustainability of this organisation beyond the duration of this action and throughout the duration of the PPP, with a view to the organisation possibly evolving into a long-term European Technology and Innovation Platform in the field of fusion, integrating wider R&I efforts across the EU;define a suitable governance structure for the PPP in the form of a co-programmed European partnership;develop a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Fusion Energy in coordination with the Commission, industry and the EU fusion community;coordinate and leverage commitments, expected in the form of in-kind contributions, from the private partners;undertake preparatory work for the possible establishment of a separate trade association representing the EU fusion industry. Among the objectives mentioned above, priority should be given to those required to launch the PPP within the period covered by the extension of the Euratom Research and Training Programme (2026-2027), subject to the Council's adoption of a Regulation on this extension.The duration of the action is expected to be 2 years.",,,,,

In this context, it implements the EU4Health general objective of improving the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicinal products and medical devices, and crisis-relevant products in the Union, and supports the innovation of such products (Article 3, point (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.The objective of this action is to foster innovation and support the development of next-generation respiratory PPE that overcomes the limitations outlined above and result in increased availability of enhanced medical countermeasures for pandemic preparedness and response. Scope:Applicants might develop completely new technologies or rely on reformulated designs and novel applications of existing materials and technologies. Applicants need to propose a detailed plan to design, prototype, validate, and CE-mark innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable next-generation respirators. To overcome the limitations outlined above, they need to offer higher levels of protection than FFP2 respirators while being universally fitting, enabling comfortable multi-hour use.Different solutions may target different populations (e.g., clinicians, critical workers, the public, etc.). Proposals should include a dissemination and market readiness plan that ensures a market for the product in preparedness times - e.g., through stockpiling or active use. This plan should generate sufficient demand to set up production.Importantly, developers also need to demonstrate feasibility for a rapid production scale-up once a public health emergency materialises, possibly relying on distributed manufacturing solutions and use of accessible raw materials. Products should demonstrate the potential to be at a cost that will allow for a switch from the currently used PPE. To encourage sustainability, products should be reusable, less harmful to the environment and ideally foster environmentally friendly production. Proposals need to take into consideration that next generation respiratory devices should be easy to store (e.g., occupying minimum space in stockpiles and having long expiry dates) and simple to use by the target population. Expected Impact:This action will support bringing next-generation PPE to the market to provide sustainable, universal and effective choices for the personal protection of healthcare and other essential workers, patients and the public. Superior respiratory protection will be available for stockpiling, scale-up and uptake by healthcare systems and the public in response to future pandemics or epidemics. The reduction of the use of single-use products will make the EU less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.Cost-effective and user-friendly next-generation respirators will slowly replace regular respirators and be deployed at national, regional, and local levels, ensuring better preparedness for future pandemics and other cross-border health threats. Widely incorporating improved respirators into clinical practice will also lead to better protection for healthcare workers and patients already in preparedness times, and overall improved health outcomes.",,,,,

The action has a centre of gravity in Widening countries. It fits within the overall Union policy of promoting more attractive research careers, implemented through Action 4 of the ERA Policy Agenda 2022-2024, and responds to the Council Conclusions on 'Deepening the European Research Area: Providing researchers with attractive and sustainable careers and working conditions and making brain circulation a reality”[1].Projects are expected to contribute to several of the following outcomes:Strengthened R&I human capital base in Widening countries with more entrepreneurial and better-trained researchers, innovators, research managers and/or other R&I talents;Boosted R&I support capacity in academic and non-academic organisations;A more balanced geographical and cross-sectoral talent circulation;Increased access for private entities to public R&I institutions, including R&I infrastructures and their know-how across Europe and beyond;Increased excellence of the research performing organisation in Widening countries;A more structured and impactful collaboration between the academic and non-academic sectors;Increased research, entrepreneurial and other transferable skills for the R&I talents exchange in the action;Improved employability and sustainable career prospects for R&I talents within the academic and non-academic sectors. Scope:ERA Talents scheme promotes inter-sectoral collaboration in R&I through cross-sectoral exchange of staff with a focus on Widening countries. With Action 4 of the ERA Policy Agenda (2022-2024), the European Commission aims, amongst other targets, to support and incentivise transformations towards a more geographically balanced talent circulation, increased interoperability of careers across different sectors, and improved employability of researchers and other R&I talent. Within this scope, ERA Talents seeks to support the training and mobility of researchers, innovators, and/or other R&I talents across sectors, focusing on Widening countries.The proposals should address one or both of following aspects related to improving training and lifelong learning opportunities for researchers, innovators, and other research and innovation talents. In particular:training in skills and competences following specific demand from other sectors (notably the business sector), leading to improved employability of individuals, increased access to knowledge for the host organisation, and overall strengthened interoperability of careers between the sectors involved; skills can particularly include entrepreneurship, use of digital tools, knowledge valorisation, intellectual property rights, and the greening of society;training to build R&I support capacity in both the academic and non-academic sectors, such as administrative, managerial, and technical staff supporting R&I activities and capacities in their organisations (e.g., data stewards, research managers and administrators, research infrastructure operators, knowledge valorisation officers). Proposals must involve organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors, exploit the complementary competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them. It is expected that this action creates a win-win situation for all consortium partners by upskilling their human capital, thereby strengthening their future competitiveness and level of excellence.Secondments:should be open to researchers, innovators, and other R&I talents (for example administrative, managerial, and technical staff supporting R&I activities and capacities in their organisations) at any career stage;should be between different sectors (from academic to non-academic or vice versa) or between non-academic participants; secondments can take place between academic participants only in the specific case of other R&I talents (for example, administrative, managerial, and technical staff supporting R&I activities and capacities in their organisations);should involve at least one participant from a Widening country;should in principle be cross-border, but in exceptional and justifiable cases, secondments can also take place within the same Widening country, e.g., to strengthen local innovation ecosystems;can only take place between independent legal entities;may be split into several stays with one or several participating organisations, but cannot exceed 24 months in total for the same staff member. Budget & applicable contribution: At least 70% of EU requested contribution should be dedicated to the beneficiaries from the Widening countries.The grant covers expenses related to the participating organisations and individual staff members hosted/seconded (e.g., administrative costs, training costs, travel and subsistence costs, salaries for seconded staff, and costs associated with dissemination, communication and knowledge valorisation).Proposals are requested to estimate the number of secondees the mobility opportunity will be provided for. The proposals, if funded, are expected to establish a Personal Career Development Plan for seconded staff, including where relevant a return plan for the seconded staff, in particular if the sending organisation is located in a Widening country. The return plan should define the support package after the secondments are ended. Approaches promising improved and more sustainable career prospects for the secondees will be regarded positively during evaluation, thus maximising the impact of the action on employability, knowledge sharing and long-term collaboration.Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations' commitments through their adopted gender equality plans and in line with the ERA objectives, as appropriate.Grants should have an expected duration of up to 4 years. [1]https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8621-2021-INIT/en/pdf",,"Introduction:In line with the strategic priority 'Deepening the ERA” this part of the work programme will support further progress on the free circulation of knowledge in an upgraded, efficient and effective R&I system. The destination will be pursued both at the level of individual researchers e.g., helping to develop the skills that researchers need for excellent science and, connecting all actors across the European Union and at the level of institutions and smaller research teams around future ERA Chair holders.ERA Chairs will support universities or research organisations from eligible countries to attract and maintain high-quality human resources under the direction of an outstanding researcher and research manager (the 'ERA Chair holder'), and to implement structural changes to achieve excellence on a sustainable basis.The institutional dimension will be complemented by opportunities for brain circulation for research and innovation talents across the ERA and across sectors, aiming to revert the brain drain from Widening countries. It will focus support to early career and experienced talents to explore unknown personal territories for professional development and training, by being mobile in the European Research Area in other sectors and in less obvious knowledge hubs across the European Union, notably in Widening countries. It will put emphasis on intersectoral mobility for early career researchers and innovators and foster a better exploitation of existing (and possibly jointly managed) research infrastructures in the targeted countries through the mobility of researchers and innovators. This aims to reinforce and strengthen the interaction between education and research, such as through the research and innovation dimension of European Universities, training and mobility. Furthermore, specific attention will be paid to promoting gender balance among the supported talents.Expected impact:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impacts:Effective institutional reforms in research institutions in Widening countries;Better use of existing research infrastructures;Excellent talents attracted in institutions and research infrastructures;Reverted brain drain;Improved linkages and increased mobility between academia and business, notably by overcoming sectoral barriers;Free circulation of knowledge and expertise in line with ERA priorities;Improved gender balance and equal opportunities.

The programme should connect local R&I communities with a broad group of stakeholders and, most importantly, citizens around the topic of science and its role in society.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:A year-long programme of diverse events and activities with a robust concept and brand, jointly developed and organised by a group of cities, promoting R&I in Europe and fostering dialogue and exchange on science and its role in society.Improved communication of science to the public through regular activities showcasing the latest developments and results in R&I and their relevance to citizens and their lives, and through experimentation with innovative ways of connecting citizens and scientists, involving different age and social groups at local, regional and European level.Enhanced discussion and debate on the future of science and R&I policy in Europe, with emphasis on inclusive and participatory approaches, involving all relevant stakeholders within and outside the EU (e.g., researchers, research funders, policy-makers, publishers, citizens, civil society organisations).Improved appeal of younger generations to careers in R&I (in academia, industry or starting own business) through organising European-wide science competitions, including the European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) and the European Union Contest for early-career researchers (EU TalentOn), as well as other similar initiatives. Scope:The new European Research Area (ERA) has the engagement of citizens, local communities and civil society at its core, seeking greater societal impact and increased trust in science. This action supports ERA Policy Agenda (2022-2024) action 14 - 'Bring science closer to citizens' through broad and inclusive engagement of all relevant stakeholders in a range of activities with a view to increasing the understanding, acceptance, uptake and impact of R&I in society.The action supports a consortium involving cities to host a coordinated joint 1-year programme with focus on connecting citizens and scientists in the participating cities and beyond, including the following:A year-long programme of various events and activities, such as lectures, workshops, exhibitions, competitions or prizes, in the spirit of the European Capital of Culture or the European Green Capital, that highlights the contribution of science to society and the results of R&I projects supported by national/regional/EU funds, including the Horizon Europe programme. In addition, the programme of activities must include the following two components:EUCYS 2026, the European Union Contest for Young Scientists, an annual science competition for 14- to 20-year-olds that brings together first prize winners of national science contests for pre-Higher Education Institution school science projects to compete for prizes and awards. The contestants are judged by a jury of eminent scientists selected by the European Commission. The jury award 1st, 2nd and 3rd monetary prizes as well as other prestigious prizes donated to the contest by international research organisations and other similar bodies. The EU Contest takes place each year in a different location. The organisation of the contest is based on the General Guidelines on the organisation of the European Union Contest for Young Scientists and its Annex 1 - Rules of the contest. These are updated annually by the European Commission[1]. The participating city that the proposal designates as host for EUCYS 2026 must provide as part of the proposal the commitment from its respective National EUCYS Organiser to run the 2026 competition as part of the project.EU TalentOn 2026, the European Union Contest for Early Career Researchers, is a biennial science competition for 21- to 35-year-olds that brings together at least 100 early-career researchers to work on scientific solutions to societal challenges[2]. The objective is to promote careers in research, facilitate cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration among early-career researchers, and to promote entrepreneurship and opportunities in academia and industry. The researchers are divided into small teams, which should be gender-balanced and be as much as possible geographically and socially inclusive, to compete for prizes and awards. The teams are mentored by experts from academia, industry and SMEs. Specific challenges are determined through a consultation with stakeholders in the field and are based on broader policy priorities. The programmed activities should target a wide population of European citizens with impact at local, regional and European level, and involve participants of different ages and across social groups and actors (students, researchers, citizens, policymakers, business and third sector organisations).Proposals should develop and test the overall concept and brand of 'Science comes to town” with a view to future editions. Proposals are invited to experiment with new interactive and engaging formats across the programmed activities. In this context, special emphasis is placed on exploring and supporting citizen science as an important dimension of open science and as a way to promote science education and various forms of public engagement with science. The programme should take place in the participating cities, but proposers are encouraged to design and implement outreach activities that reach communities beyond the ones in the cities directly participating. Wherever possible, synergies should be sought with the European Researchers' Night, Europe's largest science communication and promotion event which brings together over 1,5 million visitors across Europe every year; as well as the Researchers at School initiative, both funded under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions[3].The programme of activities must take place in at least 3 cities of 3 different Members States and/or Associated Countries, with the majority being in Member States. The consortium can comprise different types of legal entities that can represent the host cities and/or join them in designing and implementing the activities. Applicants must provide with their proposal commitment letters from the public authorities of the selected cities (city council or similar). The inclusion of local partners that provide the link to science, research and innovation is strongly encouraged.Applicants must submit as part of their proposal the overall concept for the annual programme of activities, including the vision for content (focus and scope of activities), outreach strategy, and contribution to long-term vision for the cities. The concept has to distinguish between:a) events, including EUCYS and TalentOn, that will be funded partially or fully by the Union contribution;b) activities, such as the overall coordination and communication activities, that will be funded partially or fully by the Union contribution;c) activities and events that will be financed by the participating cities; sponsorship and other resources (activities not funded by the Union contribution).The consortium has to quantify in their proposal their commitment to mobilise substantial resources beyond the Union contribution. Monetary or in-kind sponsorships are encouraged to support and broaden the programmed activities, and further increase the impact of the action. Already established activities of the participating cities and other partners are encouraged to be included in the programme, but are excluded from funding under this action. The consortium has to report on the implementation of the activities and events not financed by the Union contribution, but not the related costs.If participating cities wish to further expand the collaboration by engaging with other cities, e.g., with satellite events, they can consider to include them as partners without declaring costs in order to limit the administrative effort for them.Priority activity for the successful applicants will be to co-design the detailed draft programme of activities. This will be a deliverable, due not later than 3 months before the formal launch of the 'Science comes to town 2026”, subject to the approval of the Granting Authority.This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in the form of prizes to the total amount of:EU TalentOn: €80,000EUCYS: €70 000 The amount awarded to individuals must not exceed €60 000.The expected duration of the project is between 24 and 30 months.

It marks a paradigm change in the design of the European R&I framework programmes (FP) from an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme. Coupled to this ambition is the relaunch of the European Research Area (ERA) as described in the Commission Communication 'A new ERA for Research and Innovation” (COM/2020/628 final of 30.09.2020).The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of R&I cooperation to provide solutions to society's most demanding needs. With the priority on delivering Europe's recovery as well as on the green and digital twin transitions, a new level of ambition, linking R&I better with the economy, and with education and training, is needed to match these challenges and put scientific knowledge to work.The new ERA calls for deepening existing priorities and creating new initiatives by strengthening the mobility of researchers and the free flow of knowledge and technology, to improve access to excellence, boost market uptake and prioritise investment and reform. Working together has been the philosophy of the ERA since its launch; however, the green and digital transitions and the COVID recovery call for more and closer cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and stakeholders. They require the setting of new priorities, launching ambitious joint initiatives and developing common approaches between policies.To address these requirements, Destination 3 of part 11 of the Horizon Europe work programme will support efforts to reform and enhance the European R&I system. Destination 3 is built around four strands corresponding to the four objectives set out in the ERA Communication: Prioritising investments and reforms in research and innovation;Improving access to excellence, progressing towards excellence across the whole EU and striving for stronger research and innovation systems;Translating R&I results into the economy to meet the digital and green transition objectives, and boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies;Deepening the ERA, to further progress the free circulation of knowledge and to ensure an upgraded, efficient and effective R&I system. The principle of excellence, meaning that the best researchers with the best ideas that offer the best solutions to the societal challenges obtain funding, remains the cornerstone for all investments under the ERA.Strand 1 recognises the importance of prioritising investments and reforms to accelerate the green and digital transformation and to increase competitiveness as well as the speed and depth of the recovery. It offers support for policy-makers and addresses the need for better analysis and evidence, including simplifying and facilitating the inter-play between national and European R&I systems.Strand 2 addresses the need to improve access to excellence and to increase the performance of R&I systems, building on dedicated Horizon Europe measures as well as complementarities with smart specialisation strategies under the Cohesion Policy.Strand 3 focuses on the importance of translating R&I results into the economy. R&I policies should aim to boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies.Strand 4 addresses the challenge of deepening the ERA and includes Open Science, Higher Education and Researchers, Citizen Science, Science Education, Gender and Ethics. It aims at underpinning a new ERA benefitting from knowledge creation, circulation and use. This empowers higher education institutions and research organisations to embrace a transformative process; where a highly skilled workforce can circulate freely; and where research outputs are shared; where gender equality is assured; where the outcomes of R&I are understood, trusted and increasingly used, by educated informed scientists and citizens to the benefit of society.Expected impact: Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impacts, focussing on those that are most relevant to the respective topic: Reform and enhance of the European R&I system;Prioritisation of investments and reforms, accomplish the recovery and the twin transitions;Improved access to excellence;High quality scientific production and stronger translation of R&I results into the economy;Deepen the ERA;Coordinated national and regional R&I programmes by pooling national resources and contributing to the alignment of national research and innovation policies;Improved knowledge for policy making about the networking patterns of research support staff and research management;Synergies between research & innovation and higher education policies and programmes;Modernised higher education sector, adressing higher education, research, and innovation;Increased number of interconnected knowledge ecosystems, strong in knowledge creation, circulation and use;Researchers benefitting from attractive careers;Inclusive gender equality is promoted in the European research and innovation system;A more open and inclusive research and innovation system;Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science;Increased engagement of citizens with research and innovation;Increased alignment of strategic research with societal needs, expectations and values;Identify synergies between second and third level education, and between education and business;Increased trust in science and R&I outcomes, and greater two-way communication between science and society;Knowledge and a highly skilled workforce circulate freely;Improved capacities within the EU R&I system to conduct open science.

Scope:To emerge stronger from the pandemic and address the challenges we are facing, such as climate change, and enable the twin transition, Europe needs to translate available scientific knowledge and research results to innovative solutions, including technological as well as non-technological and social innovations, in the market, in society and for better policy making. To bring existing good practices in knowledge valorisation to support value creation across Europe, we need more experimentation, peer learning and testing of new models as well as trying out good practices in different environments.Replication and adaptation of best practices is a powerful way to support the design, implementation and evaluation of knowledge valorisation investments and measures that enhance the quality and extent of knowledge uptake at all levels. It involves identifying and taking inspiration from best practices developed across Europe, engaging in an exchange of experiences with peers and connecting to new partners, as well as driving and supporting the set-up of new measures or the reform of existing ones. Cross-border transfer of best practices in knowledge valorisation is challenging because the corresponding strategies, initiatives or tools need to be adapted to a different context and legal and financial framework and take into account skills and competences available in the new setting.Researchers can play an important role in engaging with citizens and bringing research results into communities that need innovative solutions. This can contribute to making research results more adapted to the needs of citizens and communities, and strengthen the uptake of research by society benefitting both the research communities and the citizens as users and co-creators.Proposals should address at least one of the following challenges: Experimentation in knowledge valorisation, developing innovative ways to strengthen channels of valorising knowledge and research results, in particular targeting activities that engage citizens together with researchers in producing and taking up innovative solutions.. Within the scope of the topic are schemes and incentives for researchers to engage with society and for citizens and citizens' groups to engage in knowledge valorisation and promote the co-creation of new solutions and uptake of research results. This can include means to incentivise researchers to engage with society, contributing to a stronger translation of research results to the economy and society through better adaptation to citizens' needs and collaboration with industry, as well as co-creation of innovation schemes so that citizens' needs are addressed from the beginning. The experimentation will highlight what works well and under what conditions and what are the barriers and opportunities for greater knowledge valorisation through the collaboration of researchers and citizens;Transfer of best practices in knowledge valorisation, in the area of 'academia-industry/SME linkages' or 'quadruple helix-based innovation' (i.e., involving academia/research; industry/SMEs; public administration/policy-makers and society/citizens in an ecosystem approach). Consortia are expected to involve partners that implement one or several best practices and partners that plan to introduce a new practice or reform an existing one. The action will lead to tangible change in some or all participating entities in terms of strengthening knowledge valorisation capacities, be it at strategic and/or investment level and/or through the implementation of new or adapted instruments, tools, guidelines, trainings etc. The action can also help develop and prepare knowledge valorisation projects and investments that receive support from the European cohesion policy or the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). If support from the European cohesion policy or the RRF is sought, the concrete measures planned to be taken should be described. Inspiration for best practices can be found in the repository on the EU Knowledge Valorisation Platform. The involvement of practitioners beyond academic institutions would allow to address the challenges appropriately.

The scheme aims to improve the inclusiveness of Horizon Europe by involving more research institutions from Widening countries under Horizon Europe Pillar 2 and EIC Pathfinder actions.Main selection criteria are excellence and added value of the new partner performing a relevant additional task in the project. All consortium partners need to agree on the accession of the new partner whereas the R&I relevance and complementarity needs to be demonstrated. The accepted application will trigger a GA amendment with the service in charge of the related topic.Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:At system level, it mobilises excellence in the Widening countries, increases visibility of the participants from the Widening countries, improves knowledge circulation, and reduces lack of participation of the Widening countries in specific thematic domains;At organisation level, it opens up silos of established closed consortia, improves research excellence of the Widening country's institutions in specific fields, enlarges outreach of the participants' R&I actions and provides access to new talent pools;At the level of the beneficiary, new competencies and skills for working in transnational projects including research management and dissemination and exploitation are acquired. Scope:The Hop On Facility integrates one additional participant from a Widening country to an ongoing project under Pillar 2 or the EIC pathfinder scheme while topping up a relevant task or work package and the cost incurred by the additional participant. This will happen on a voluntary basis without affecting the freedom of choice for the consortium and the principle of excellence. The Hop On Facility is open to all topics under Pillar 2 and the EIC pathfinder. Applications with activities that contribute to the policy objective of the transition towards a green and digital economy are especially encouraged.The action will be part of an existing project with a valid Grant Agreement.

The coordinator may request the coordination fee and provide an explanation on the additional integration efforts for the new partner.",,"Introduction The ERA Communication [[(COM(2020) 628 final, https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0628&from=EN)]] established the need to improve access to excellence as one of the four main strategic goals. Striving towards excellence requires a stronger R&I system where best practice is disseminated faster across the European Union. The strategic plan for Horizon Europe aims to underpin geographical diversity, building the necessary capacity to allow successful participation in the R&I process and to promote networking and access to excellence thus optimising the impact of Pillar 2 and contributing to the objectives of the entire programme.This destination will address 'improving access to excellence” through a portfolio of complementary actions that aim to build up R&I capacities in Widening countries, as well as through national and regional R&I reforms and investments, to enable them to advance to the competitive edge at European and international level. It will contribute to the development of a pan European innovation ecosystem and thus to innovation. This portfolio also constitutes the widening dimension of a broader European Excellence Initiative that reaches out beyond this programme as it is implemented in conjunction with ERASMUS+.Each of the seven proposed calls addresses a different target group of potential beneficiaries with a customised intervention logic. The use and appropriate design of partnerships with leading institutions abroad will be a key driver for accessing excellence. The intervention logic is designed to work points at a multitude of scales ranging from individual researcher through career development, focused networks, institutional development to a systemic impact on national R&I systems.Capacity building will go beyond purely scientific scope as it encompasses the development of management and administrative competencies for the benefit of institutions (notably in Twinning and the European Excellence Initiative) eager to take over consortium leadership roles especially under Pillar 2. Teaming actions will create new or modernise existing centres of excellence by means of close and strategic partnerships with leading institutions abroad. The impact will be amplified by the conditionality of securing complementary investment (especially for infrastructure, building, hardware) from the structural funds or other sources. Once established the centres will function as lighthouses with far reaching impact and role models for attracting the best talents. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the success of modern governance and management, and thus stimulate generalised reforms in the national R&I landscape.Two new actions will complement this portfolio as catalysts for better impact and sustainability of the widening actions. The dissemination and exploitation support facility will help beneficiaries of widening actions to improve the effectiveness of their dissemination and exploitation and unlock new sources of funding. The pathways to excellence scheme will unlock synergies of Horizon projects with funds under the cohesion policy in Widening countries.In a complementary manner with a focus on the academic and higher education system, the university-related scheme will foster reforms in Widening countries embedded in dynamic university alliances in Europe. Scientific excellence in the more traditional sense is the aim of Twinning where focused networks with excellent partners will develop new promising R&I domains and test novel approaches in smaller joint research projects.Innovation excellence is the focus of excellence hubs where innovation ecosystems in Widening countries and beyond will team up and strive to create better links between academia, business, government and society that will foster a real placed-based innovation culture in Widening countries based on a strategic agenda in line with regional or national smart specialisation strategies. In this context, synergies will be sought with the programme parts of the European Innovation Ecosystems and the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT).In addition, particular attention will be paid to cross-cutting objectives set for Horizon Europe, such as gender equality and open science practices, through the different funded actions.Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contribute to the following expected impacts:Increased science and innovation capacity for all actors in the R&I system in Widening countries;Structural changes leading to modernised and more competitive R&I systems in eligible countries;Reformed R&I systems and institutions leading to increased attractiveness and retention of research talents;Mobilisation of national and EU resources for strategic investments;Higher participation success in Horizon Europe and more consortium leadership roles;Stronger links between academia and business and improved career permeability;Strengthened role of the Higher Education sector in research and innovation;Greater involvement of regional actors in the R&I process;Improved outreach to international level for all actors.

Action 4 of the ERA Policy Agenda 2022-2024 - 'Promote attractive and sustainable research careers, balanced talent circulation and international, transdisciplinary and inter-sectoral mobility across the ERA” - annexed to the November 2021 Council Conclusions on the 'Future governance of the European Research Area' foresees the development of a European framework for research careers, together with the upgrade of existing instruments and initiatives, including the revision of the Charter for Researchers. It also includes amongst its expected outcomes the development of new instruments to support research careers, such as the one proposed with this call topic.This action will promote implementing the standards for attractive careers as laid down in the new Charter for Researchers and the Council recommendation on a European framework for research careers[1], responding to the political call for ""labour market players to join forces for attractive careers”. It will support cooperation between academic, private and public sector entities at organisational level to create ecosystems that ensure attractive early research careers perspectives, provide researchers with skill sets that match labour market requirements, thus providing the talent pool needed for a truly functioning internal market for knowledge. Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:Establishment of ecosystems for research positions, in particular for early stage researchers, in academia, R&I performing institutions and businesses, connecting research training providers (in particular academia) and the researchers' labour market (such as businesses, universities, research and technology organisations and government entities), supplying employers with skilled research talent that match labour market needs, including skills needs from the Green Deal, digital transition, and deep tech;Wide implementation of the standards for attractive researcher careers as laid out in the new Charter for Researchers, leading to more attractive, more diverse and more interoperable careers for researchers across all sectors, contributing to a better-balanced and sustainable circulation of skilled and entrepreneurial workforce;Improved early careers researchers' competences and employability within and beyond academia, as well as career interoperability between sectors. Scope:The action supports consortia to create 'talent ecosystems' with a large pool of research and innovation positions operating under good training and working conditions in line with the new Charter for Researchers and the Council recommendation on a European framework for research careers, providing non-academic organisations, particularly businesses, with well-skilled researchers and other R&I talents, thereby increasing employability of early career researchers and improving interoperability of their careers between sectors.This action particularly supports whole organisations and innovation ecosystems to implement the standards for attractive research careers laid down in the Charter for Researchers. A special focus is placed on organisational change in support of early career researchers[2], to offer them more and better career opportunities, including through strengthened coordination of measures at European, national, and regional level and increased cooperation between academia, industry, government and public sector.The action is expected to be implemented by consortia consisting of both training providers (in particular academia) and employers of researchers (academia and organisations from non-academic sector, in particular businesses[3]) from across the European Research Area, creating connected 'talent ecosystems” that allow the free flow of talents and create attractive perspectives for researchers' careers within this ecosystem and beyond. A talent ecosystem for researchers is to be understood as a cohesive and interdependent system that encompasses various elements related to HR management of research talent. It can be thematic (e.g., targeted to R&I on climate, pharma, automotive, music industry) or have a more comprehensive target. It is designed to adapt to the evolving needs of the researcher labour market and the different occupations for researchers across sectors along the R1-R4 profiles, ensuring more customised training, career development and talent flowthrough. Such ecosystem is built around delivering a better employee experience and aligning with frequently changing priorities; it is agile and flexible to environmental shifts in the R&I system, such as changing labour market dynamics and skills needs. It provides distinct strategies for managing different research profiles, essential for competing in the global labour market, while delivering skilled research talent that match European labour market needs.Consortia are expected to mainstream the Charter's principles and good working conditions across all participating organisations, which need to demonstrate in the application a high ambition as to the number of (new or existing) research positions that will benefit from the organisational change within the duration of the grant, ultimately leading to coverage of all its research staff. Participating organisations are expected to have received the HR Excellence in Research Award (HRS4R[4]) or commit to apply the new Charter for Researchers and commit to its implementation (i.e., start the HRS4R process) within the grant duration, as far as relevant for their operations linked to the employment of researchers.This action does not support salaries and mobility of individual researchers or teams of researchers. Instead, this action supports activities that lead to organisational change for more attractive research careers in line with the needs of R&I labour market players, towards the creation of sustainable talent ecosystems.Funding will support implementation of good working conditions and reinforce flowthrough of talents between sectors, towards better employability of talent trained as researcher and increased interoperability of research careers between academia and non-academic sector entities. Activities can include (non-exhaustive list) the mapping of challenges, the development of action plans to bring the organisations in line with the new Charter for Researchers, scaling excellence in HR, and networking and relationship building for connecting the talent ecosystem partners. On a more practical level, activities could include the roll out of ResearchComp[5] in the organisational training and career development activities, the establishment of career services and training systems for early career researchers, the involvement of non-academic sector in the training of researchers, and relationship building between sectors for talent circulation.This action is a pilot, testing the principles for a future investment strategy for attractive research careers at whole organisation and ecosystem level. Actions are therefore expected to provide policy feedback to the European Commission and Member States on the progress made, the success generated, and the obstacles encountered. Grants can have a duration of up to 3 years; a longer duration is possible if duly justified.

It marks a paradigm change in the design of the European R&I framework programmes (FP) from an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme. Coupled to this ambition is the relaunch of the European Research Area (ERA) as described in the Commission Communication 'A new ERA for Research and Innovation” (COM/2020/628 final of 30.09.2020).The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of R&I cooperation to provide solutions to society's most demanding needs. With the priority on delivering Europe's recovery as well as on the green and digital twin transitions, a new level of ambition, linking R&I better with the economy, and with education and training, is needed to match these challenges and put scientific knowledge to work.The new ERA calls for deepening existing priorities and creating new initiatives by strengthening the mobility of researchers and the free flow of knowledge and technology, to improve access to excellence, boost market uptake and prioritise investment and reform. Working together has been the philosophy of the ERA since its launch; however, the green and digital transitions and the COVID recovery call for more and closer cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and stakeholders. They require the setting of new priorities, launching ambitious joint initiatives and developing common approaches between policies.To address these requirements, Destination 3 of part 11 of the Horizon Europe work programme will support efforts to reform and enhance the European R&I system. Destination 3 is built around four strands corresponding to the four objectives set out in the ERA Communication: Prioritising investments and reforms in research and innovation;Improving access to excellence, progressing towards excellence across the whole EU and striving for stronger research and innovation systems;Translating R&I results into the economy to meet the digital and green transition objectives, and boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies;Deepening the ERA, to further progress the free circulation of knowledge and to ensure an upgraded, efficient and effective R&I system. The principle of excellence, meaning that the best researchers with the best ideas that offer the best solutions to the societal challenges obtain funding, remains the cornerstone for all investments under the ERA.Strand 1 recognises the importance of prioritising investments and reforms to accelerate the green and digital transformation and to increase competitiveness as well as the speed and depth of the recovery. It offers support for policy-makers and addresses the need for better analysis and evidence, including simplifying and facilitating the inter-play between national and European R&I systems.Strand 2 addresses the need to improve access to excellence and to increase the performance of R&I systems, building on dedicated Horizon Europe measures as well as complementarities with smart specialisation strategies under the Cohesion Policy.Strand 3 focuses on the importance of translating R&I results into the economy. R&I policies should aim to boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies.Strand 4 addresses the challenge of deepening the ERA and includes Open Science, Higher Education and Researchers, Citizen Science, Science Education, Gender and Ethics. It aims at underpinning a new ERA benefitting from knowledge creation, circulation and use. This empowers higher education institutions and research organisations to embrace a transformative process; where a highly skilled workforce can circulate freely; and where research outputs are shared; where gender equality is assured; where the outcomes of R&I are understood, trusted and increasingly used, by educated informed scientists and citizens to the benefit of society.Expected impact: Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impacts, focussing on those that are most relevant to the respective topic: Reform and enhance of the European R&I system;Prioritisation of investments and reforms, accomplish the recovery and the twin transitions;Improved access to excellence;High quality scientific production and stronger translation of R&I results into the economy;Deepen the ERA;Coordinated national and regional R&I programmes by pooling national resources and contributing to the alignment of national research and innovation policies;Improved knowledge for policy making about the networking patterns of research support staff and research management;Synergies between research & innovation and higher education policies and programmes;Modernised higher education sector, adressing higher education, research, and innovation;Increased number of interconnected knowledge ecosystems, strong in knowledge creation, circulation and use;Researchers benefitting from attractive careers;Inclusive gender equality is promoted in the European research and innovation system;A more open and inclusive research and innovation system;Increased capacity in the EU R&I system to conduct open science and to set it as a modus operandi of modern science;Increased engagement of citizens with research and innovation;Increased alignment of strategic research with societal needs, expectations and values;Identify synergies between second and third level education, and between education and business;Increased trust in science and R&I outcomes, and greater two-way communication between science and society;Knowledge and a highly skilled workforce circulate freely;Improved capacities within the EU R&I system to conduct open science.

The target group are host organisations located in Widening Countries.Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:For supported ERA Fellows:Increased set of research and transferable skills and competences, leading to improved employability and career prospects of fellows within academia and beyond;New mind-sets and approaches to R&I work forged through international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary experience;Enhanced networking and communication capacities with scientific peers, as well as with the general public, that will increase and broaden the research and innovation impact; For participating organisations in the Widening Countries:Increased alignment of working conditions for researchers in accordance with the principles set out in the European Charter for Researchers[1];Enhanced quality and sustainability of research training and supervision;Increased global attractiveness, visibility and reputation of the participating organisation(s);Stronger R&I capacity and output among participating organisations; better transfer of knowledge;Regular feedback of research results into teaching and education at participating organisations. For Widening countries:Increased attractiveness for researchers to entities in Widening countries, by providing competitive grants and spreading attractive working and employment practices;More postdoctoral researchers attracted to Widening countries. Scope:Fellowships should be provided to excellent researchers, undertaking cross-border mobility. Applications must be made jointly by the researcher together with a legal entity in the academic or non-academic sector located in a Widening Country.ERA Fellowships should take place in a Widening Country. Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to the EU from any country in the world or moving within the EU to a Widening Country.In order to apply for the ERA Fellowships call, applicants must submit their proposal to the Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024[2]. To be eligible to this call the host organisation must be located in an eligible Widening country. The application to the (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024 will be automatically resubmitted to this call in case the proposal fails to reach an adequate place in the ranking to be funded. This simplified submission procedure to the ERA Fellowships call presents applicants moving to Widening countries with an additional funding opportunity but there is the possibility to opt out during the application stage.The proposals submitted under the ERA Fellowships must fulfil all the admissibility and eligibility conditions of the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024 and pass all the thresholds for that call.ERA Fellowships will be implemented applying the award criteria, scoring and threshold for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions. The ranking order for the ERA Fellowships call will follow the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024 call scores and evaluation procedure and proposals will also retain the scores and comments included in the Evaluation Summary Report (ESR) of this call. The MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024 model grant agreement will be used to the ERA Fellowships.SecondmentsResearchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.Placements in the non-academic sectorERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.Training activitiesThe training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills[3], foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g., commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs, including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).Career Development PlanIn order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan has to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.

The destination will be pursued both at the level of individual researchers e.g., helping to develop the skills that researchers need for excellent science and, connecting all actors across the European Union and at the level of institutions and smaller research teams around future ERA Chair holders.ERA Chairs will support universities or research organisations from eligible countries to attract and maintain high-quality human resources under the direction of an outstanding researcher and research manager (the 'ERA Chair holder'), and to implement structural changes to achieve excellence on a sustainable basis.The institutional dimension will be complemented by opportunities for brain circulation for research and innovation talents across the ERA and across sectors, aiming to revert the brain drain from Widening countries. It will focus support to early career and experienced talents to explore unknown personal territories for professional development and training, by being mobile in the European Research Area in other sectors and in less obvious knowledge hubs across the European Union, notably in Widening countries. It will put emphasis on intersectoral mobility for early career researchers and innovators and foster a better exploitation of existing (and possibly jointly managed) research infrastructures in the targeted countries through the mobility of researchers and innovators. This aims to reinforce and strengthen the interaction between education and research, such as through the research and innovation dimension of European Universities, training and mobility. Furthermore, specific attention will be paid to promoting gender balance among the supported talents.Expected impact:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impacts:Effective institutional reforms in research institutions in Widening countries;Better use of existing research infrastructures;Excellent talents attracted in institutions and research infrastructures;Reverted brain drain;Improved linkages and increased mobility between academia and business, notably by overcoming sectoral barriers;Free circulation of knowledge and expertise in line with ERA priorities;Improved gender balance and equal opportunities.

Scope:The successful proposal should:Develop the UNCAN.eu platform by integrating and, where relevant, complementing existing or planned data nodes of European research infrastructures and/or other national infrastructures that may link various cancer data holders across Member States and Associated Countries (e.g. hospitals, research centres, comprehensive cancer centres, etc.). The number of Member States involved should be sufficient to demonstrate scalability and flexibility of the UNCAN.eu platform while allowing for stepwise onboarding of more countries.Provide tools, services and workflows to researchers across data nodes for dataset creation, standardisation, data discovery, secure access, management, visualization, harmonization, analysis and other functions as appropriate. This task should capitalise on EOSC4cancer's achievements, integrating and expanding as appropriate the available tools and solutions. It should also take advantage of the European Health Data Space and the European Open Science Cloud frameworks.Design and implement a rich and diverse portfolio of use-cases to inform, steer the development and demonstrate the validity of the UNCAN.eu platform. Use cases should focus on research questions that are in line with the Cancer Mission objectives and that may advance the understanding of mechanisms involved in cancer development and progression beyond the current state of the art. At least one use-case should target a cancer type with a 5-year overall survival of less than 50% from the time of diagnosis. A second use-case should target paediatric cancer.At the same time, use-cases should be functional to the design and implementation of UNCAN.eu to increase the diversity of digital tools and services available for cancer researchers. The mobilisation and integration of a large amount of research and real word data beyond current practice and a balanced participation of clinicians, disease experts and data scientists will be essential to achieve the objectives of this topic. Due attention should be paid to sex and gender, disaggregating the data as appropriate.The successful consortium should develop innovative approaches, to integrate and analyse heterogeneous data from multiple sources and different research domains[3], including the participation of the necessary interdisciplinary set of European infrastructures and national data nodes. In this regard, at least one use-case should integrate imaging, digital pathology and genomic data, using and/or contributing with new data sources to the Genomics Data Infrastructure (GDI)[4] and Cancer Image Europe (EUCAIM)[5].Give emphasis to data being managed and shared in line with the FAIR principles, and the concept of FAIR-by-design is applied wherever possible. The applicants must demonstrate that the necessary data sources are, or will be, effectively and timely available. During the project lifetime, new data sources that might become available at a later stage can be accommodated as well as allowing additional data holders to join the UNCAN.eu platform. Results must be open source and made available through a public repository under a permissive license. Open access data should be provided whenever possible.Give due consideration to, and establish appropriate links with, EU-funded initiatives such as EHDS-related governance and implementation actions[6], the European Network of Cancer Registries[7].Foresee to establish links with the successful proposal resulting from the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CANCER-01-02 'Support dialogue towards the development of national cancer data nodes'. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.The Commission will facilitate coordination. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings, and potential joint activities without the prerequisite to give details of these at this stage. Examples are organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate.Successful proposal will be asked to join the 'Understanding' cluster for the Mission on Cancer established in 2022[8].

HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-07,Development of high spatial-resolution monitoring approaches and geographically-explicit registry for carbon farming,HORIZON-RIA HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions,HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-05-08T00:00:00,2024-10-08T17:00:00,,11500000,11500000,2,46944843,46598018HORIZONResearchandInnovationActions1715126400000,"ExpectedOutcome:Activities under this topic will help to progress towards the objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', in particular specific objective 2 'Conserve and increase soil organic carbon stocks”. Activities will also support the proposed Carbon Removal Certification (CRC) Framework (including through collaboration with the Commission's Expert Group on Carbon Removals) [1], the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation [2], the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Action Plan on the development of Organic Production, and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 on Climate action.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:The confidence of stakeholders (including land managers) in participating in possible carbon farming certification schemes and the attractiveness of the carbon farming [3] business model are enhanced through better access to information and data regarding soil carbon (achievable sequestration and storage, risks of release, etc.). This should allow to improve soil management performance and mitigate the negative climate impact of activities in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Reliable benchmarks or baselines for soil carbon at land management parcel level across the EU are established, with a view to providing financial rewards to those farmers and forest managers/owners who go beyond the baselines within the proposed framework for Carbon Removal Certification.Improved decision making in the LULUCF sector at the regional or national level thanks to enhanced quality of national GHG inventories and geographically explicit soil monitoring elements that reflect action at the individual level.Market situation and social dimension are better integrated into EU carbon farming policy, in particular as regards the impact of carbon farming incentives on rural development, farmers' and foresters' incomes, competitiveness, food security and land access. Business strategies and (digital) marketplaces for carbon farming, including a registry for carbon farming credits/certificates, support EU carbon farming policy.Regulated EU carbon credits and environmental and financial incentives, within legal frameworks and for certified measures for carbon farming deployment strategies, specifically for foresters and agricultural land managers or owners, are supported. This should be aligned with the EU CRC Framework aiming at promoting carbon removal activities and fight greenwashing by encouraging forestry and agricultural sectors to act in this field and effectively demonstrate that carbon farming can be quantified through appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) methods. Scope:With the European Commission's proposal for a first EU-wide voluntary framework to reliably certify high-quality carbon removals (Carbon Removal Certification -CRC- Framework) [4], the EU aims to boost sustainable carbon farming solutions by significantly improving Europe's capacity to quantify, monitor and verify carbon removals. Higher transparency will ensure trust from stakeholders and prevent greenwashing. The development of soil carbon removal deployment strategies and a robust and validated soil carbon monitoring system approach, at scale relevant for land managers, are therefore crucial. This system approach is currently underdeveloped and solid and reliable data for establishment of baselines for soil carbon at parcel level across Europe are missing. The system approach should further the potential for financial rewards to farmers and forest managers/owners who excel in their carbon farming practices, in line with the CRC Framework proposal. It should also lead to enhanced quality of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories for the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, as well as be relevant for the establishment of the database for the proposed EU Soil Monitoring Law. To show the extent to which a carbon farming activity results in a positive climate impact, the European Commission will establish standardised baselines reflecting the standard performance of comparable activities in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances and geographical locations. This type of baselines ensures objectivity and transparency, minimises compliance costs and other administrative costs, and positively recognises the action of first movers who have already engaged in carbon farming activities. However, the geographically-explicit data needed to identify and set such standardised baselines and help prioritise regions and actions for carbon farming is currently missing.Moreover, it is important that the EU boosts sustainable carbon farming solutions by enabling a business model that financially rewards land managers for such activities, as stressed by the EU CRC Framework and the Commission's 2021 Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles. The EU CRC Framework aims to ensure that financial incentives from both private and public sources are channelled towards high-quality carbon removals and nature-based solutions. However, to ensure its correct functioning, interoperable public registries and MRV protocols compliant with standards and technical rules to be set out at EU level are needed. These will ensure transparency, full traceability of carbon farming certificates, an easily accessible marketplace for these certificates, and avoid fraud risk and double counting.Proposed activities should:Develop, validate and apply pilot, innovative, robust, local soil carbon monitoring systems in line with the CRC Framework proposal, able to gather the data needed for the European Commission to set out standardised baselines reflecting the standard performance of comparable activities in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances and geographical locations in Europe. These systems should also allow to evaluate achievable biophysical potential of carbon storage and related co-benefits of carbon farming activities, at land management parcel-scale [5] and for the whole European territory, and help prioritise regions and actions for carbon farming.Investigate and develop approaches and methodologies for soil [6] sampling pertinent to the granular level of the monitoring, including assessment and exploitation of the technological innovation opportunities and the potential to reduce monitoring costs.Leverage the power of existing remote sensing tools such as those typically employed in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) control, i.e., in conjunction with spatially explicit parcel data (e.g., Land Parcel Identification System - Geospatial Application (LPIS-GSA)); and develop a structured, standardized system for understanding and managing the direct effect of carbon farming practices on soil carbon (including the practices promoted by the CAP).Demonstrate and where possible expand the power of digital tools and technologies (including electronic databases and geographic information systems/geographically-explicit digital map data, remote sensing, artificial intelligence and machine learning) for (decreasing the costs of) the data collection, for establishing baselines and for the monitoring of carbon removal activities.Deliver guidance (e.g. manuals) for policymakers and certification bodies on soil monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), data collection protocols, and baselines against which action is quantified. Such guidance should be designed within the upcoming EU CRC Framework and in consultation with the Commission's Expert Group on Carbon Removals.Develop and test harmonisation protocols within a distributed data management system for the integration and direct comparison of upcoming CRC data and existing spatially explicit information contained in national LULUCF inventories and other soil organic carbon datasets (such as LUCAS, and pertinent national datasets).Develop a framework to collect and analyse data coming from certificates (both within existing voluntary carbon markets and the upcoming CRC Framework), to define reliable ranges of carbon sequestration and outliers, and consolidate interoperable, quality-checked datasets.Use results of the above work to calibrate and validate modelling frameworks applicable to the monitoring methodologies mentioned above in this topic.Create metrics to gauge carbon sensitivity to perturbations, particularly those linked with climate change, by analysing different soil carbon fractions.Evaluate the permanency-related risks of release of carbon, using modelling scenarios.Address key uncertainties and scientific knowledge gaps that currently exist within carbon removal quantification methods, helping to develop a standardised MRV approach.Undertake an in-depth assessment of the market situation for carbon farming, building on existing and ongoing research, to assess the (expected) overall market impacts of carbon farming, including the potential income opportunities for farmers and other land managers, impacts on land productivity and land prices, and sensitivities over the 'commodification” of carbon removals and ecosystem services, for different carbon farming activities (e.g. agroforestry, rewetting of land and other practices).Analyse the different channels and business strategies for the marketing of certified carbon removals, providing an overview of the current market and outlook for the next 10 years. This analysis should consider differences between marketing certified carbon removals within and outside the agri-food or forestry value chains and identify the relevant market players in each case.Create a network among existing carbon farming schemes across several European countries and scale up their activities by developing an interoperable digital marketplace, based on a geographically-explicit registry, that provides easier access to the carbon farming units certified by those different schemes. This registry should follow the rules set out in the CRC Framework and be consistent with Member States' reporting in the LULUCF sector so as to enable Member States to improve their GHG inventory data. The registry should enable monetary transactions involving carbon credits, however the project(s) should not directly carry out such transactions. The 'carbon farming' activities to be covered are those defined in the CRC Framework proposal. Whenever relevant, the synergies and trade-offs between carbon and nitrogen and their possible optimisation should be covered. All types of land, including forests and their above-ground biomass, where relevant, should be covered. In the case of the agricultural sector, organic farming, as an approach with potential to increase carbon sequestration in the soil, should be included.Key information/data on soil carbon should be shared with land managers, to enable them to learn from peers and facilitate access to tailored advice and certification services to improve their soil management performance and verify the mitigation impact of their activities in view of possible certification. Given the necessity for new ideas that meet social needs, create social relationships and form new collaborations within this topic's subject, proposals should integrate social innovation.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with other relevant forthcoming projects as well as to capitalise on activities and results from on-going, relevant projects. In particular, projects should build on the preparatory work done by projects funded by the EJP SOIL programme (e.g. CarboSeq project), AI4SoilHealth, BENCHMARKS, MaRVIC, MRV4SOC, CREDIBLE, HoliSoils, CLIMB-FOREST, INFORMA, OptFor-EU, the ORCaSa project, InBestSoil, NOVASOIL, SoilValues, and the project originating from the HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-09 topic (on carbon farming in living labs), as well as work carried out by the Joint Research Centre on the establishment of baselines for the implementation of the CRC Framework.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs, and between existing databases and models, through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), the upcoming EU Forest Observatory and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

Scope:Peatlands can provide multiple ecosystem services such as timber production, climate regulation, water quality control, flood abatement, biodiversity conservation, as well as recreational benefits. However, this potential is compromised due to drainage. Alternative soil management practices for forest peat soils, in particular through the combination of rewetting techniques and forest management (with the exclusion of afforestation), have the potential to improve the environmental, climate and economic performance of peatlands, as well as reduce the impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment and dissolved organic carbon exports. In particular, practices are needed that effectively address trade-offs from forests multifunctionality and apply an integrated approach to their management (considering biodiversity, climate change challenges, bio-economy needs etc.). This topic does not cover agricultural emissions.Proposed activities should:Establish demonstration(s) of sustainable, climate-positive and biodiversity-relevant forest management on peat soils, including rewetting;Assess the benefits of the practices regarding carbon sequestration, while taking into consideration any impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment and dissolved organic carbon exports from forest peat soils, thus providing information and indicators (such as baseline, quantification method, MRV) of the practices to maximise climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity and other benefits.Improve monitoring techniques, including remote-sensing and field-data methods integrating technologies such as AI and robotics, and develop large-scale, minimally invasive GHG measurement facilities on re-wetted sites, to better assess biodiversity and climate aspects of forest management.Consider and assess the potential of demonstrated activities to be replicated and scaled up, particularly with a view to developing financial incentives under the EU certification framework, and to this end develop approaches and recommendations for policymakers and land managers. The project(s) must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain and all relevant actors (landowners, foresters, scientists, advisors, local/regional/national public authorities, industry, etc.) throughout the different stages of project development and implementation.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to build on and collaborate with ongoing Horizon projects, notably MRV4SOC, MaRVIC, ALFAwetlands, WET HORIZONS, RESTORE4Cs and REWET and with projects to be supported through topics 'HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-8: Conservation and protection of carbon-rich and biodiversity-rich forest ecosystems”, 'HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-2: Socio-economic, climate and environmental aspects of paludiculture"", and ""HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-3: Paludiculture: large-scale demonstration'.Where relevant, proposals should also build links with projects funded under the Mission 'Adaptation to Climate Change”. Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this and future calls of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs, and between existing databases and models, through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), the upcoming EU Forest Observatory and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO [1]https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02018R0841-20230511[2]Commission proposes certification of carbon removals (europa.eu)","Life on earth depends on healthy soils.

Scope:Achieving climate neutrality by 2050 is a central goal of the European Green Deal. However, soil-derived gaseous nitrogen emissions from agriculture are often overlooked due to challenges in monitoring. A comprehensive assessment of both gaseous and non-gaseous nitrogen losses, including their geographical distribution and varying temporal resolution, is essential to inform effective greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies and encourage the adoption of higher Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tiers at the national level.Nitrogen losses are highly episodic, and the current temporal and spatial resolution of information regarding nitrogen dynamics across Europe is insufficient for a comprehensive estimation of the full nitrogen budget at a continental scale. The most commonly used methodology for measuring N-flux involves discontinuous flux measurements accompanied by standard gap-filling methods, which lead to large uncertainties and biased emission factors. Additionally, most existing observations focus on temperate zones and single flux exit pathways, neglecting the full spectrum of nitrogen forms, including both gaseous and non-gaseous forms across different climatic conditions. Data and observations are particularly lacking in the Mediterranean basin and some nitrogen transformation pathways are not well investigated. For example, widely used modelling approaches estimate the reduction of N2O to N2 by applying a conversion factor developed in laboratory conditions that do not comprehensively represent the vast array of soil types found in Europe. These ratios are subject to bias associated with the use of linear rates for nonlinear dynamics. To address these gaps, accurate information must be acquired, which will facilitate the development of effective management strategies that effectively minimise total nitrogen losses from soil. Additionally, this information will improve the parameterization and validation of models and increase the confidence of model predictions when scaled to the continental level. This will ultimately lead to a more refined and accurate estimation of nitrogen surplus, enrich existing dashboard estimates, and further support the evaluation of the effectiveness of management strategies, and guide future research and policy decisions related to mitigation efforts.Proposed activities should:Develop and employ advanced nitrogen monitoring and analytical techniques to generate high temporal resolution data on nitrogen fluxes and their drivers in various climatic conditions with particular focus on underrepresented pedo-climatic conditions.Implement a coordinated, holistic approach to develop and evaluate robust, practical management strategies that effectively minimise total nitrogen losses from soils while addressing potential trade-offs with other environmental concerns, such as water quality and soil carbon preservation.Utilise advanced modelling approaches to analyse the collected data, identify patterns and relationships between soil biogeochemical processes and nitrogen fluxes, and improve predictive tools that can be used to inform management strategies on a regional to continental scale.Implement and monitor pilot projects that test the effectiveness of the developed management strategies in diverse pedo-climatic zones, accounting for local environmental conditions, agricultural practices both in conventional and organic farming systems, and socio-economic factors that may influence adoption and outcomes.Synthesise the findings from field studies, modelling efforts, and pilot projects into a comprehensive estimation of the full nitrogen budget at the European continental scale contributing to the EU Soil Observatory through the provision of high-quality datasets for monitoring, reporting and verification.Development of scenarios on how climate change and land use change will affect nitrogen cycling through the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project Soil-WISE. In particular, to ensure inter-operability between existing databases and models and their integration in the EUSO.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to build on the work of other projects working on quantification of nitrogen fluxes in Europe that are being funded by other entities, including philanthropic organisations, particularly where there is geographical or thematic complementarity.In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.","Life on earth depends on healthy soils.

Activities will also contribute to the targets of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and of the Farm to Fork strategy on pesticide use reduction (reducing the use and risk of pesticides by 50% and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50%), the EU Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production, the Common Agricultural Policy, and will support the objectives of the future Nature Restoration Law and of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity COP-15. Activities will also provide knowledge to improve integrated pest management practices, directly contributing to the achievement of several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular SDG´s target 12.2 of achieving sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources by 2030.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Soil and crop health are enhanced, sustaining crop productivity and food security while promoting the stability and resilience of agriculture and increasing agrobiodiversity.The dependence on external inputs in crop management is reduced through effective plant-soil interactions and exploiting the potential of the soil microbiome.Harnessing the role of soil biodiversity through a better knowledge of the relationship between biodiversity and soil functions.The availability of integrated pest management practices is enlarged.Increased and accelerated uptake of good practices which enhance plant and soil health for effective crop management supporting long-term provision of ecosystem services. Scope:Below ground biodiversity plays a major role in soil structure, nutrient supply, water cycling, nutrient uptake by plants, and in the biocontrol of plant pests and diseases. The interactions between communities of soil organisms, crops and their environment (holobiont) profoundly influence crop, soil and agroecosystem health and productivity. Notably, the interplay between soil fauna, soil microbial community, soil chemistry, and plant immune responses can be enhanced to harness the potential of soil ecosystem to defend against pathogens, pests and other detrimental organisms and to promote plant health and productivity. By managing soil ecosystems to enhance soil health through farming practices (e.g., crop rotation, use of microbiome solutions, etc.), it is possible to support plant defences, suppress diseases, improve nutrient availability and enhance plant resilience to various stressors. In addition, agricultural sustainability will be increased and contribute to climate change mitigation.There is a need to develop, test and deploy management practices that, by enhancing soil health, will facilitate, for instance, the management of soil-borne plant pests and diseases (e.g., bacteria, fungi, nematodes, root-feeding insects), and support ground nesting pollinators.Proposed activities should:Develop and test site-specific innovations including management practices, solutions and tools that promote soil biodiversity, enhance soil health, stimulate plant growth, reduce chemical inputs to control soil borne plant diseases and root-feeding insects, and support ground nesting pollinators.Set up demonstration sites to test the proposed innovations and promote the benefits of soil biodiversity and healthy soils not only for growers and the agroecosystem but for the entire food value chain.Assess the social, economic and environmental issues associated with the proposed innovative solution, including trade-offs, the impact on labour, safety culture, and risk management on farms;Generate comprehensive capacity building material, organize trainings or knowledge sharing activities, including the development of guidelines to accelerate the dissemination, uptake and upscale of results.Enhance peer-to-peer learning with relevant stakeholders from farmers and advisors to policy makers and consumers, supporting a coordinated scientific and policy approach towards healthy soils. Proposals should focus on arable crops. Work under this topic should be carried out in various pedo-climatic zones [2] and benefit both the conventional and the organic farming as reflected in the expertise of the consortia. Agroecological approaches such as those developed for example under organic farming should be capitalised on and given due attention in the proposed activities.Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as researchers, farmers, advisors, and industry including SMEs are brought together. Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to implement activities in the demonstration sites and encourage end-user engagement.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with other projects funded under this topic as well as to capitalise on activities and results from relevant Horizon projects such as EXCALIBUR, SoildiverAgro, EcoStack, IWMPRAISE, SOILGUARD, WHEATBIOME, TRIBIOME, BIOservicES, SOB4ES, GOOD, AGROSUS and CONSERWA and those to be funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-7: Innovations in plant protection: alternatives to reduce the use of pesticides focusing on candidates for substitution) and HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-05: Soil health, pollinators and key ecosystem functions to avoid duplication, and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), the EU Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this and future calls of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'. [1]Mission implementation plan[2]https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/biogeographical-regions-in-europe-2","Life on earth depends on healthy soils. Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

This means that large areas of important habitats offshore remain unprotected (such as soft sediment bottoms or habitats of highly mobile species such as marine mammals), which hinders the achievement of EU and global marine conservation targets to achieve a coherent MPA network. One of the main challenges for the establishment of offshore MPAs is the lack of knowledge about the distribution and condition of marine habitats, as well as pressures affecting them, due to high cost and effort needed for their surveillance and research. This has also been raised by Member States as one of the main issues with the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and of the future Nature Restoration Law. Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will contribute to achieving the Mission objective 1 - Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity.  Proposals are expected to contribute to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, including the Marine Action Plan, the Birds, Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework directives and the future Nature Restoration Law as well as relevant international agreements (e.g.: the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction - BBNJ).    The proposed activities should cover all following objectives:  - mapping the distribution and condition of marine (benthic and pelagic) habitats in offshore[1] areas (beyond 12 nautical miles from the coast); - providing the scientific basis for establishing new marine protected areas (or enlarging existing ones) in offshore areas, including strictly protected ones; - assessing pressures (including cumulative ones) in offshore areas and establishing the necessary conservation measures for MPAs, including through elaboration of their management plans and monitoring schemes. Projects are encouraged to actively involve Member States/Associated Countries' authorities and concerned stakeholders.Proposals should be site-specific, and the number of sites, their size, objectives and management measures of the protected area(s) for demonstration activities have to be ecologically relevant and impactful and contribute to enhance ecosystem services.Projects should build and capitalise on the knowledge base developed and lessons learnt from other projects, initiatives and programmes linked to the field of biodiversity, marine environment and conservation, as well as on the work carried out in relation to Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems, as required under the REGULATION (EU) 2016/2336 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2016 establishing specific conditions for fishing for deep-sea stocks in the north-east Atlantic and provisions for fishing in international waters of the north-east Atlantic and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002.Projects funded under this topic are expected to  show a significant replication potential by identifying areas and locations where the proposed measures could be replicable. An action plan and roadmap needed for the replication and scale up of the proposed measures for offshore marine protected areas are expected to be drawn up by the end of the project, taking into account Marine Spatial Planning plans. For improved coordination and networking, the applicants should set aside resources for activities to engage with other relevant actions funded under Horizon Europe, in particular projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 6 topics, Mission Ocean and Waters topics, EMFAF/EMFF and LIFE activities.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU.

Support progress in restoring our ocean and waters, in adapting to climate change, reversing biodiversity loss and pollution, by co-designing inspiring narratives that stimulate effective action by policy-makers, citizens and stakeholders, and by identifying the pathways that are necessary to realise them. Increased awareness of decision-makers, stakeholders and citizens, including students, through structured science-policy interfaces, in relation to the urgency of the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises and the central role of restoring the entire water system to address these crises. National, regional and local decision-makers in planning decisions are taking measures to protect and restore their ocean, coastal and water spaces and ecosystems. Scope:This action will develop and co-design transitional alternative futures of the EU, in which the Ocean, seas and waters are conserved or restored to good health. The action will support the co-creation of narratives, and innovative visualisation tools such as maps, related to different scenarios of what the EU and its ocean, seas and water spaces could look like by 2030 and 2050 if innovative solutions to restore our ocean and waters would be applied, so that the targets of the Mission Ocean and Waters and consequently those of the European Green Deal are fully reached. These narratives must be supported by the co-design of different science-based transition pathways together with citizens including students and key stakeholders such as scientists, experts and decision-makers responsible for planning ocean and water spaces. The co-design process should be inclusive, participatory following transdisciplinary and structured science-policy-society interface methodologies and taking into consideration environmental, social, economic and political considerations.Following on from a pan-European vision, proposals should also develop specific regional visions, scenarios and narratives for each of the four Mission lighthouse areas in the Atlantic-Arctic, Danube, Mediterranean Sea, Baltic and North Sea, supported by innovative visualisation tools and co-created by multi-actors such as local stakeholders and citizens. By choosing a minimum of four large scale case-studies, the action should enable the participatory co-design of alternative futures where the Mission objectives have been achieved in the lighthouse area, and develop together with the relevant stakeholders the action pathways and necessary narratives to achieve these alternative futures.Proposals should develop and visualise different scenarios for each of the case-studies, with both 2030- and 2050-time horizons in line with the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and EU Green Deal targets. They should at least encompass a business-as-usual scenario, in which current trends are extrapolated, as well as a scenario where European Green Deal and relevant environmental legislation (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive[1], Birds[2] and Habitats[3] Directives, Water Framework Directive[4]) targets for climate, biodiversity and pollution are fully reached through the large-scale deployment of innovative solutions. The change scenario(s) should build on deliverables of relevant Mission related projects[5], best practices on citizen participation and deliberative democracy, national initiatives as well as state-of-the-art models and draw on data and projections from the IPCC, IPBES, European Environment Agency and JRC. Finally, they should rely on and be compatible with the EU Digital Twin Ocean developments and eventually become one of its use-cases.Scenarios of the future should in particular include the deployment at scale of innovative solutions with a special emphasis on nature-based solutions[6], which are proven to be environmentally, economically and socially effective and which address in particular the climate change, biodiversity and pollution driven challenges to the ocean and water system[7], including biodiversity loss and its impacts on marine ecosystems and sectors relying on it, sea level rise, extreme weather, as well as pollution of the seas, coasts and rivers.

The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).

Scope:During the first phase of the implementation of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030', a number of waterfront cities, regions and islands started to become engaged[1] in the Mission with adhesions to the Mission Charter[2].The proposal should coordinate, support and strengthen this growing movement to create a broad Coalition supporting the Mission Ocean and Waters, which will focus on waterfront cities with their ports (coastal and inland), as well as regions and islands committed to implementing this Mission. Importantly, it should aim to build a broad coalition, which also includes, in addition to the regions/cities/islands who already adhered to the Mission Charter, new and so far less active members with equal representation from all Mission lighthouse areas.Proposals should:establish and strengthen a Coalition of coastal and inland waterfront cities (including their maritime or inland water ports), regions and islands across the EU and Associated countries;support the governance, implementation and reporting of the Coalition;co-ordinating, networking, twinning, and mentoring of the Coalition members, as well as sharing best practices and deploying solutions together with the projects resulting from the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-01 and in collaboration with the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Platform;develop participatory processes for cities, regions and islands to be able to better plan and implement actions aiming to reach the Missions objectives; establish robust mechanisms for regional and local dialogues and facilitate coordination and collaboration between the Coalition and relevant national, regional and local authorities, communities, as well as relevant networks and initiatives in order to engage a large number of stakeholders, including private actors and citizens, in the protection and restoration of the ocean, seas and waters.enhance the visibility of the Coalition activities through targeted communication actions and educational campaigns engaging local communities, schools, and the general public;leverage funds to support the actions of the Coalition, in interaction with managing authorities and the private sector, where relevant. The proposals should support the public authorities that become members of the Coalition by enabling them to engage with various other local stakeholders, including the private sector, NGOs, citizens, investors, other local and regional authorities, in co-design, co-development and co-implementation strategies and actions for the health of oceans, seas, and inland waters. The proposals should help to ensure that the Coalition has a balanced representation of diverse communities across Member States and Associated Countries, including participation of smaller cities and municipalities.The proposals should help the Coalition to forge links and coordinate with other important EU initiatives and key players (while at the same time avoiding overlaps), such as the EU Cities Mission, the Horizon Europe Partnership for a Sustainable Blue Economy, the European Environment Agency and organisations in charge of protection of the marine and coastal environment in Europe; as well as relevant international activities. The proposals may also collaborate with and build on the experience of other relevant existing networks, partnerships and initiatives[3] as well as take into account relevant strategic research and innovation agendas and regional strategies.The proposals should enable the Coalition to leverage funds for implementing the actions to achieve the Mission objectives, including through facilitated synergies and access to EU, national, regional and private funds and strategies, in interaction with managing authorities if applicable (e.g. ERDF, EMFAF, LIFE, Interreg, RRF, RIS3/RIS4 etc), the financial sector (e.g. EIB), investors and philanthropies.The proposals should also support the Commission in developing, launching and implementing a Mission Ocean and Waters Label, under guidance of and in a close collaboration with the EC Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[4]. The Label should be awarded to entities that have already adhered to the Charter or are planning to do so, and whose activities or transition plans are being assessed as stand-out in terms of excellence and impact towards reaching Mission objectives. The Label will recognise the commitment to achieving the Mission objectives and facilitate access to possible funding and investment. In particular, the proposals should work with the EC Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat to define detailed objectives and criteria for awarding the Label, taking into account and building on existing certification or label[5]￼; develop measurable certification standards in line with the Mission's targets and a transparent verification process, as well as help conduct a pilot exercise awarding the Label to the first group of actors that qualify for it. In order to accelerate and facilitate broad adoption of the Label, the proposals should develop a strategy for the promotion of the Label, including defining the benefits for the entities that would undergo the labelling, and choosing the most appropriate tools and methods for raising awareness of the Label, including the design of a compelling brand identity for the Label in line with the visual identity of the Mission and establishing partnerships with key stakeholders. The proposals should also foresee provision of guidance and support to the communities of actors wishing to apply for the Label. The labelled entities will also be integrated in the existing Mission community networks, and receive support from the Mission Implementation Platform and other initiatives and projects linked to the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters. The proposals should put in place a system to monitor and evaluate the labelled entities, as well as promote collaboration among them. The proposals should also establish necessary support structures to ensure longevity of the Label. The labelling process will be designed and implemented in close collaboration with the EC Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[4]The proposals should work closely with other Horizon Europe projects, particularly Prep4Blue, the 4 Mission lighthouse CSA projects (EcoDaLLi[7], BlueMissionAA[8], BlueMissionMed[9], BlueMissionBANOS[10]), the projects selected under HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-01 and the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Platform [11] in order to ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps. The project resulting from this topic will be implemented in close collaboration with the relevant EC service(s) and Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[4] to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission.Applicants should be flexible enough to accommodate for some adjustments that may be requested by the Commission before the grant agreement signature to ensure complementarity of activities between the projects CSA projects selected in past Mission calls (Prep4Blue, EcoDaLLi, BlueMissionAA, BlueMissionMed, BlueMissionBANOS), the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Platform, and the projects selected under topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-01.

It supports the Soil Mission specific objectives, in particular the following ones: 3 'No net soil sealing and increase the reuse of urban soils”, 4 'Reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration”, 5 'Prevent erosion”, and specific objective 8 'Increase soil literacy in society across Member States”.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.Practice-oriented knowledge, tools and techniques are more easily available to urban communities, local city councils/regions and land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across across neighbourhood/communities, territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regards to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies. Scope:While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and green European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.Nowadays, there are various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users [1]. For the purpose of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', ¨soil health living labs are defined as 'user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption”.Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level [2]. Individual sites could be e.g., urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried-out and monitored under real-life conditions.Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as 'places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement”. They are individual, local sites (one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context, applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites.Urbanization is a challenge for soil health, due to construction and infrastructure development that entails, among other, land take, soil sealing, contamination or compaction. Against this background and by working together on common challenges, actors in living labs in urban areas will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, benefit from cross-fertilisation, and connect with their local/regional ecosystem. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.More specifically, each of the funded projects should:Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, if relevant) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s) faced by soils in urban areas (e.g., sealing, contamination, fertility, erosion, compaction, etc.) while increasing the overall resilience of urban areas. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission's specific objectives [3]. Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, land uses, Mission objectives addressed).Establish, based on the projects' goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s) identified, taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed strategies and solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Where relevant, regeneration of soil health or repurpose of soils on urban areas to provide locally sourced fresh and healthy food to local food services (e.g., canteens, restaurants, food trucks, markets, etc.) and citizens should be considered.Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the Soil Mission Implementation Plan and the descriptors of the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience.Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators. In particular, for living labs working on soil sealing, identify urban-specific monitoring methods in connection to the work developed by Copernicus and for the functional and ecological impacts of the soil sealing process.Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes. In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement a multi-actor approach. The list of stakeholders will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and should involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public authorities (e.g., administrators responsible for green spaces (such as parks, gardens and urban farms), urban planners, schools, and representatives of civil society (e.g., citizens, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, based on their areas of expertise. For example, while some partners may lead conceptual work and coordinate work within and across living labs, others may focus on conducting experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or participating in outreach activities. Where relevant, soil literacy activities for citizens including on agroecology and permaculture should be considered.To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe: This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties [4].Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of stakeholders can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.Applicants are reminded that they can benefit from the services of NATI00NS, the project dedicated to support potential applicants to the living labs topics.In order to increase impact and sustainability, applicants are encouraged to explore and test new (or in combination with existing) funding schemes and financial instruments, either public or private involving, where relevant, finance providers such as public authorities or financial institutions and investors.Projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of SOILL18, the dedicated 'Living Lab Support Structure' established to provide tailor-made advice to participants of living labs and lighthouses in their day-to-day operations, as well as enforce the monitoring of their activities in a systematic way, reporting on the main outcomes and experiences. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to collaborate with SOILL as well as with other projects relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s) and urban soils, funded either under the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' or under other parts and pillars of Horizon Europe or other EU programmes, as appropriate. For the latter these would include networking, attendance to meetings and organisation of joint activities (e.g., workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities). The details of the joint activities would be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and the life of the project.Collaboration and synergies with the Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities” is highly encouraged if living labs are established within one or more of the cities nominated as part of that EU Mission [5]. In addition, if relevant, projects should explore complementary synergies with ongoing Horizon Europe projects such as CLEVERFOOD that is developing a Food 2030 Connected Lab Network of living labs. Additionally, funded projects should collaborate with BENCHMARKS and AI4SoilHealth, which are key new projects looking at sampling, monitoring validating and further development of indicators and proxy measurements for soil health, as well as using AI technology to accelerate the collection and use of soil health information.The projects may also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs) or the upcoming European partnerships on Agroecology [6] and on Sustainable Food Systems [7].Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

Activities will also contribute to the EU Soil Strategy 2030, the Common Agricultural Policy and its Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF), the framework of indicators in the proposed Soil Monitoring Law, and the EU Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicator set for monitoring progress towards SDG 15 and SDG 2.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Enhanced knowledge on multi-process soil erosion dynamics (e.g., water, wind, tillage, etc.) across Europe based on a combination of novel computer-based estimates and monitoring activities for better estimation of policy impact.Further validation of soil loss by water and wind erosion indicators at continental scale with local/regional assessments which can be used for policy making and implementation (e.g., in the Common Agricultural Policy, the Soil Strategy for 2030 or the proposed directive of soil monitoring and resilience).Best management practices that significantly reduce erosion adjusted to different pedo-climatic conditions in Europe and various cropping systems are compiled and more widely known by relevant stakeholders including land managers such as farmers.A robust soil erosion monitoring network is established across EU and Associated Countries to further develop estimates and validate gross erosion rates at parcel level. Scope:Current EU/European estimates on soil loss by water and wind erosion are long-term averages performed with empirical models, which, in agricultural areas, are subject to huge uncertainties. Policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) would benefit from more up to-date and annual estimates. Improved estimates would contribute to developing a process-based model, which can incorporate management practices and their potential for reducing soil loss by water, and wind erosion in agricultural fields and facilitate the adoption of the best practices. Other processes such as tillage erosion or gullies can also be considered. Existing partially explicit parcel data (e.g., LPIS-GSA), data from the EU Land use and land cover survey (LUCAS) and the latest updates from the COPERNICUS platform could/should be used to improve current pan-European modelling frameworks.Proposed activities should:Create a network of stakeholders to monitor soil loss by water and wind erosion across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries in different crop conditions (including managed grasslands).Develop a monitoring scheme to implement, test and validate methods for assessing soil loss by soil erosion at European (continental) scale.Develop process-based models at continental scale, which consider soil erosion factors such as management practices applied by farmers, rainfall intensity, soil properties, topography and other biophysical attributes.Incorporate both field observations and latest state-of-the-art Copernicus products to better quantify and calibrate soil erosion factors.Quantify the impact of different management practices (e.g., cover crops, reduced tillage, plant residues, mulching, grass margins, crop rotation, terraces, etc.) on reducing soil erosion.Link those scientific outputs (e.g. improved soil erosion factors, impact of management practices) with the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) requirements of the CAP (e.g., impact of management practices such as cover crops or reduced tillage in CAP GAECs).Provide landowners and various stakeholders with best information on soil losses and with recommendations on the most suitable management practices to reduce soil loss. Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate and capitalise on activities and results from projects financed under other Work Programme topics of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', in particular AI4SoilHealth, Benchmarks and Soil O-Live.Cooperation with international networks in UNCCD, FAO Global Soil Partnership and the IPCC is encouraged to upscale the produced knowledge at global scale.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project SoilWISE. In particular, to ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be used and displayed in the EUSO.","Life on earth depends on healthy soils. Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices.

Scope:Addressing societal challenges such as climate change, energy poverty, the pandemic, ageing population or the increased societal divide will require to rethink the way we develop and live in our neighbourhoods. Current ways of planning, designing and building often overlook the importance of continuously engaging end-users or local communities. Yet, incorporating community knowledge and efforts can lead to more liveable neighbourhoods that reflect local needs and contexts and empower current and future residents. Moreover, the way public spaces are designed can have an important impact on the way people interact with each other, the kind of activities that take place in such spaces, and the trust of people towards their local authority and thus democracy. Therefore, it is key to empower people to take an active role in co-designing those spaces. This can lead to greater acceptance, enhanced sense of belonging, social trust and an increased willingness to further engage with the community, and thus promote a global positive social impact on people's well-being and the neighbourhood as a whole.Building on work carried out in previous projects, proposals will study, refine and validate existing engagement approaches, that allow residents, businesses, cultural organisations and local governments to co-design and co-create public spaces in neighbourhoods. For instance, this should include how to involve citizens in the development and maintenance of public spaces and neighbourhoods; or flexible designs allowing communities to re-create or re-furbish spaces according to evolving needs. Special attention should be paid to involve diverse groups and citizens at risk of exclusion.Proposals are expected to address all of the following:Study and refine engagement model(s) and methodology(ies) that enables the meaningful participation of concerned stakeholders and citizens in the co-design, refurbishment and development of public spaces in their neighbourhoods. The model and methodology should: Be inclusive and accessible, and ensure that citizens are empowered to contribute to the decision-making processes;Use innovative digital tools, platforms and technologies such as augmented reality or virtual reality, to facilitate virtual and physical collaboration between citizens, designers, urban planners, policymakers and the construction ecosystem to enhance citizen engagement in the planning, design and construction process while ensuring that digital solutions remain inclusive and accessible, and assessing their added value compared to 'traditional' in-person methods. Demonstrate that the chosen engagement approach(es) (e.g. model, methodology, digital tools) can effectively and measurably foster openness, social cohesion, trust and acceptance within communities as well as promote the inclusion of marginalised communities and/or vulnerable groups in public space redevelopment projects. Proposals should demonstrate this in at least three neighbourhoods with differing local environmental, social and economic conditions, and each one located in a different Member State or Associated Country.Monitor and evaluate all stages of the chosen engagement approach(es), using an appropriate methodology, and measure the success of projects in fostering openness, social cohesion, acceptance within communities as well as the inclusion of marginalised communities and vulnerable groups.Assess how the above may impact future project design and decision-making in the construction of neighbourhoods as well as in the construction ecosystem. Cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration between architects, engineers, designers, creative sectors, natural and social scientists, urban planners, environmentalists, and by extension the broader cultural and creative sector is encouraged. The involvement of relevant stakeholders such as local small organizations, communities' representatives, end-users, and local authorities in the design and implementation of the project is also encouraged.Actions are strongly recommended to collaborate with and build on the work of relevant research[1]. Actions are also encouraged to take into account and contribute with their results to future work on the impact of public spaces on social relations in neighbourhood communities.Projects shall share their intermediate and final results and findings with the 'New European Bauhaus hub for results and impacts' that will be established[2].

It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[ https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(https://craft-cities.eu/)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[COM(2020) 662 final]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent”, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see 'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe']]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.Innovative funding and financing models are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions. These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.R&I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Covenant of Mayors and past and ongoing relevant projects funded by Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, such as STARTS, as well as with other EU programmes such as LIFE-CET, LIFE-Circular Economy, URBACT, Green City Accord and European Green Capital/Leaf awards.",,,

Along the same lines, the Technical Measures Regulation includes the objective of contributing to ensure that incidental caches of sensitive marine species are minimised and where possible eliminated so that they do not represent a threat to the conservation status of these species and to provide protection for juvenile and spawning aggregations of fish species.In this context, the Marine Action Plan: 'Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient fisheries' stemming from the EU Biodiversity Strategy seeks to accelerate the transition to more sustainable professional and recreational fishing practices. It puts forward several actions to protect vulnerable and sensitive species and juvenile fish, notably through improving gear selectivity and practices to reduce their by-catch, using technological innovations and practices to prevent incidental catches and reducing the impact of fisheries on marine biodiversity and habitats, including sensitive marine ecosystems.This topic will support the Common Fisheries Policy, the Technical Measures Regulation, the EU Biodiversity Strategy, including the future Nature Restoration Law and the Marine Action Plan, the Habitats, Birds and MSFD directives as well as the EU sea basin strategies.Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will contribute to achieve the Mission objectives 'Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity' and 'Make the blue economy carbon- neutral and circular'. Projects should build and capitalise on the knowledge base developed and lessons learnt from other projects, initiatives and programmes linked to the field of biodiversity, marine environment and conservation, including projects and studies funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe; EMFF, EMFAF and LIFE programmes, as well as relevant work done by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)[1], by the General Fisheries commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)[2] and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)[3] as well as relevant work done at basin level[4], in the Member States and Associated Countries.In particular, the projects funded under this topic could benefit from cooperation and sharing of information and data through collaboration with Horizon Europe projects selected under the topic on 'Understanding and reducing bycatch of protected species' (HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-5).Proposals under this topic are expected to identify, test, validate and demonstrate in real conditions, a set of suitable innovative and economically viable solutions, technologies, practices and processes to minimise the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems, specifically aiming at protecting sensitive species and juvenile fish as identified in the Marine Action Plan[5] as well as respecting animal health and welfare.  Each proposal should address one sea basin (i.e.: 1. Atlantic and Arctic basin or 2. Mediterranean Sea basin or 3. Baltic and North Sea basin), where identified solutions will be demonstrated in several relevant fisheries. Proposals should take a holistic approach aiming at protecting marine biodiversity while also avoiding potential negative environmental impacts, including on the seabed.Proposals should also consider the energy efficiency and climate neutrality of the proposed solutions, thus contributing to the energy transition of the EU fisheries sector.Projects should actively involve end-users and fisheries communities in their activities. Activities should be tailored to address regional/sea basin specificities and when relevant, local/regional authorities should be engaged, e.g.: Fisheries Management authorities. Project activities should cover all following issues:demonstrating mitigation measures and sustainable fishing tools, e.g.: innovative gears and techniques improving selectivity and addressing incidental bycatch, such as exclusion devices, use of frangible gear, acoustic deterrent devices, escape panels, and other solutions;demonstrating mitigation measures and sustainable fishing operations, such as restricting fishing activities in targeted areas, temporal and/or spatial closures, safe handling of bycaught species and reducing mortality of discarded species, experimental restocking programmes and other solutions;carrying out specific activities to assess operational feasibility in commercial fishery situations and to support fishers in taking-up the solutions as well as to promote sea-food products from sustainable fisheries. In addition, projects are expected to show a significant replication potential by identifying a range of relevant stakeholders who could replicate the proposed solutions. Action plans and roadmaps needed for the replication and scale up of the solutions for sustainable fishing operation and tools should be drawn up by the end of the project.Proposals addressing the EU Outermost Regions[6] are encouraged, given these regions' natural assets.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU.

Among the various marine citizen science activities, very prominent are the ones that engage actors from different parts of society to contribute to the observation of the coastal zone and the ocean and produce relevant data, related to physical, chemical, geological properties of the marine environment, marine biodiversity and/or human impact (e.g.: marine litter). It is important to capitalise on this interest, both by sustaining and increasing the sense of community and motivation of these actors and by providing them with validated methodological protocols and processes, to ensure that the information and data they collect becomes available and useful for wider use.The objective of this topic is to establish a Marine Citizen Science data network, which will aim to bring together the very important, but scattered and un-coordinated actors of marine citizen science, active in data collection. Such a network will provide a sense of community to these different in nature parties, will increase visibility of marine citizen science data collection activities in Europe and will invest in coordinating these activities by providing a harmonisation framework, which will increase the added value coming from marine citizen science. Such an activity will ensure dual effects towards the Mission's Ocean cross-cutting enabling actions: it will support targeted engagement of different categories of social actors in the production of credible Marine Knowledge and it will thus directly support the development of the Digital Ocean and Water Knowledge System.Proposals are expected to address all following activities:Establishment of a Marine Citizen Science network The pan-European Marine Citizen Science data network is expected to bring together actors in marine citizen science data collection domains in the European Union and in neighbouring countries and to build a sense of community between these actors, engaging and coordinating different type of organisations. The core aim of the network will be to support its participants to contact the various marine citizen science data collection communities efficiently and in a manner that will increase the added value of their contribution towards Marine Knowledge. The network should aim to include actors from all different data fields on marine citizen science.A key activity for the establishment of the network consists in the identification, mapping and involvement of the different actors that provide observation and data input to marine citizen science, extending from volunteer or scientific groups (schools, NGOs or universities, tourists) to more structured community contributions that can come from professionals (for instance fishermen) or companies (sailing companies, port authorities, etc.) that are willing to contribute in these initiatives.The network should act as a multiplier of work contacted on marine citizen science data collection from different organisations around Europe and operate as a connection hub for their activities. Through the described actions the network will ensure the higher visibility of marine citizen science data collection activities in Europe and will contribute both to motivate the already engaged actors and to bring in the network more interested parties, by connecting them with the appropriate organisations, providing them with community advice on how to set up their own activities, in line with common standards and sharing the collective knowledge created through the network.The long-term sustainability of the proposed network should be considered.Citizen science activities: information and data collection To increase the added value of the marine citizen science activities, the proposals should ensure that information and data collected are widely usable and integrated in existing knowledge management platforms (e.g.: EMODnet, Blue Economy Observatory, etc.) and in the end be available for use in the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO).Specific activities are expected to adapt and make available data and metadata standards appropriate for use in marine citizen science, building on the work developed by SeaDataNet, EMODnet and other marine data infrastructures. These standards should be tailored to the needs of citizen science and ensure that the data collected can be harmonised and used in an effective manner.The proposals should also consider the development of easy-to-use tutorials and easy-to-understand training modules, targeted to different categories of marine citizens science actors collecting data. This material should focus on methodologies to ensure that the data collected is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), will explain how data is made available and will provide recommendations and guidelines for effective citizen science observing activities. The training materials should also ensure that citizen science activities do not conflict with nature protection objectives.Finally, the proposals are expected to address the development of good practices regarding data and information consumption coming from marine citizen science activities and make these good practices visible at local, national and European level, as well as at the international level, particularly through the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.Deployment of cost-efficient, citizen science appropriate observing equipment The proposals should ensure the link between marine citizen science actors and the developers of cost-efficient ocean observing sensors and to facilitate the procurement of appropriate and easy to use citizen science devices and equipment that will enhance and harmonise the outputs of marine citizen science in Europe.Proposals are expected to define and implement two use-cases to demonstrate in real conditions the use of affordable, durable, high-efficiency and low-carbon footprint marine observing devices/equipment, relevant and applicable to marine citizen science. Observing devices/sensors that are easy to use, automated, standardised and with direct uploading of date in verified databases should be prioritised.These use-cases will act as pilots, to show, on one side the benefits of using standardised, simple to deploy and use equipment for wide citizen science campaigns and on the other, the benefits and the economies of scale of large procurements of observing devices/equipment for citizen science.These use-cases should also provide insights for the mobilisation of public and private funding to maximise future deployment and use of observation devices/sensors, thus supporting the scaling up of marine citizen science activities in Europe.","The Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030' will provide a systemic approach for the restoration, protection and preservation of our ocean, seas and waters.

Scope:As stated in the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Plan, the deployment and upscaling phase (phase 2 of the Mission starting in 2026) aims to 'enable broad participation in the Mission across the EU” with 'a strong citizen, stakeholder and community governance element”. In the second phase of the Mission implementation, the solutions developed and piloted in the first phase (development and piloting phase) to deliver on the Mission and Green Deal objectives will be further deployed, replicated, and scaled up. Therefore, in the last years of phase 1, a transition to the deployment and upscaling phase needs to be well prepared.Reaching the ambitious Mission objectives and targets is dependent on mobilising a broad set of actors to take meaningful action to restore our ocean, seas and waters. Practical, easily accessible support is needed for established or emerging communities of actors to facilitate the deployment at scale of innovative actions, measures and initiatives contributing to the EU Mission's objectives, and the transformations required at national, regional, and local level.Each proposed action under this topic should address one of the four basins covered by the Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030'[3] and should foresee all of the following types of support to Mission communities of actors of the respective basin: financial support to third parties (also referred to as cascading grants) to community-led pilot actions; cascading grants for transition agendas; and technical assistance, to be provided by the consortium.Cascading grants to community-led pilot actionsEach proposal under this topic should foresee awarding at least 5 cascading grants of EUR 200 000 - EUR 2 million[4] per grant to community-led pilot actions that are implementing innovative solutions towards achieving one or several interlinked Mission objectives in the respective basin addressed by the proposal. The Commission estimates that the total budget for the cascading call to support community-led actions could be in the order of EUR 7 million. These third-party community-led actions may be implemented by a consortium of several participants. The size of the consortium and the budget requested should reflect the specific local needs addressed by the third-party action.The proposals must ensure that the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted is based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness, in accordance with Annex B of the general annexes to this work programme.The proposals are expected to provide a detailed plan for the cascading grant call for the community-led pilot actions, in particular planning the launch of the call no later than the end of month 3 of the project. The proposals should describe appropriate means to promote the cascading grant call at lighthouse, national and regional levels that would allow them to reach as many of the potential applicants as possible.The third-party actions supported through the cascading call should demonstrate measurable, verifiable, and ambitious progress towards reaching at least one or, whenever possible and applicable, several interlinked objectives and targets set out in the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Plan. The chosen focus of the third-party actions should depend on which objective(s) are most urgent for the communities dealing with specific conditions and realities in a particular area. However, addressing several objectives, in the case that this is feasible, may provide an added value and should thus be seen as advantage for the applications in the cascading calls.The third-party actions should focus on implementing innovative solutions that go beyond the state of the art and that combine, as appropriate, technological, nature-based, social, cultural, regulatory, and financial innovation, and new governance models. The actions should foster a participatory approach that empowers local stakeholders, builds on their local know-how and application of sustainable practices, and encourages their long-term commitment to the protection, restoration and de-pollution of our ocean, seas and waters and to making the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular. With the help from the project consortia selected under this topic, the community-led third-party actions should promote the deployment and upscaling of innovative solutions to restore the ocean and waters, including through the preparation of deployment plans.The community-led third-party actions should be encouraged to cooperate with scientific institutions to stimulate transdisciplinary innovation activities, which are based on best available science practices. Transdisciplinary activities denote cooperation of diverse societal stakeholder groups (administration, civil society, business & industry, finance, etc.), not only across academic disciplines ('interdisciplinary').These community-led actions should also consider an effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. Social innovation should also be considered in order to match innovative ideas with social needs.The proposals should encourage the third-party actions to build on research and innovation developed by projects financed under the current and/or previous EU framework programmes and other relevant EU and national programmes, linking also to the Mission Implementation Platform[5], and where applicable, make use of Copernicus/Galileo/EGNOS and Emodnet.Attracting additional financing from Structural Funds or any national, regional, local programmes or private funding at any stage of the community-led pilot actions is strongly encouraged.The types of Mission communities relevant to the cascading grants may include at least the following:ports (including inland ports);islands;fishing communities, aquaculture producers and other representatives of blue economy;operators of various vessels;Local Action Groups described by the Community-Led Local Development strategies[6]waterfront cities or regions / communities (avoiding overlaps with Cities' Mission);conservation communities;representatives of the tourism sector;maritime infrastructure operators (incl. offshore platforms and their operators). Various types of actors in the communities listed above could apply for the support. These could include for example:regional and local authorities;NGOs, foundations, professional associations, and other entities engaged in local development and nature conservation activities;educational establishments;locally based companies (provided this is not in conflict with the State Aid rules);research performing organisations, etc. Cascading grants for transition agendas Each proposed action should also foresee awarding at least 20 cascading grants for transition agendas of up to EUR 100 000 each, addressing the types of Mission communities described above. The proposed actions should ensure that the selection process of the third parties to which financial support for transition agendas would be granted is based on principles of transparency, objectivity, and fairness, in accordance with Annex B of the general annexes to this work programme.A transition agenda for this call is understood as a strategic roadmap towards reaching all objectives and targets of the Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030' in the applicant communities, with a particular focus on the objectives that are most relevant to the specific community. The roadmaps could cover processes needed to ensure the protection and restoration of marine/coastal/inland waters, biodiversity and ecosystems, the reduction/elimination of pollution and the achievement of decarbonisation and circularity targets, as well as include a plan for a defined number of years concerning the objectives set, covering, for example, expected outcomes, results, impact, ways to achieve them and ways to bring in financing to support the achievement of these objectives.The transition agenda should indicate how specific results and ideally also their impacts are expected to materialise in order to ensure the actual achievements of the objectives. These agendas would serve as a basis for further planning of follow-up activities by the actors involved, particularly actions to meet the Mission Ocean and Waters objectives/targets, to be subsequently implemented with the financial support of various funds (e.g., EU structural funds/national/regional funds).All entities establishing transition agendas should commit to report to the project that had issued the third-party financing within 6 months after finalisation of the agendas on the progress of implementing its results in practice.Technical assistance to Mission Communities of actorsThe proposals should also foresee technical assistance to Mission Communities of actors in the basin addressed by the respective action. Such assistance should address the needs of the Mission communities of actors in the particular basin and may include support and advice needed for the preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, impact assessments, and needs assessment, as well as long-term sustainability planning to help the communities of actors develop sustainable financing strategies to ensure longevity of the efforts to achieve healthy oceans, seas and waters; capacity building to empower communities of actors with the knowledge and skills needed to undertake effective pollution prevention and elimination, conservation and restoration initiatives, as well as making the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular; and other Mission-related actions that would require direct counselling, written guidance, online materials, webinars, in-depths sessions, deep dives, peer-to-peer support, twinning etc.).It is essential to tailor the support provided to the specific needs and context of each community of actors, including through the use of local languages, as well as fostering a participatory approach that empowers local stakeholders and encourages their long-term commitment to the protection and restoration of our ocean, seas and waters.The proposals under this topic should also work on clustering of and support to the third-party community-led actions. The proposals should help create a network of these community-led actions to enhance communication, collaboration and sharing of knowledge and best practices to maximise their combined impact, and create links to the networks similarly created by the other three projects selected under this topic in other Mission lighthouse areas.Furthermore, the proposals should assist each community-led action in using its experiences and solutions to establish new networks and collaborations in their respective areas. The proposals should provide guidance and support to the third-party actions in forming partnerships with local communities, NGOs, government agencies, or relevant stakeholders to expand the impact of the actions and create a collaborative ecosystem for knowledge sharing, resource optimisation, and wider adoption of successful solutions.The proposals should provide help and guidance to the selected community-led actions regarding access to additional funding. The proposals should also identify, evaluate, and showcase feasible and scalable solutions demonstrated by the community-led actions, and provide guidance on deployment of these solutions.Furthermore, the proposals should set aside funds for clustering and collaboration among four projects selected under this topic, including for a joint monitoring and evaluation framework to track the progress of each third-party community-led action project and assess their collective impact.In order to ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps concerning the provision of all three types of support described above, the proposals should work closely with other Horizon Europe projects, particularly Prep4Blue, the relevant Mission lighthouse CSA projects (EcoDaLLi[7], BlueMissionAA[8], BlueMissionMed[9], BlueMissionBANOS[10]), the project selected under HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-02, the public procurement prepared under Other Actions of WP 2022 'Studies to support communities of actors to achieve the EU Mission: Restore our Ocean and Waters objectives”, and the Mission Implementation Platform (MIP), notably with the work MIP does on deployment and upscaling of solutions. The proposals may also collaborate with and build on the experience of relevant existing networks, partnerships and initiatives[11], as well as take into account relevant strategic research and innovation agendas and regional strategies.The projects resulting from this call should be implemented in close collaboration with the relevant EC service(s) and the Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[12] to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission.Proposals should be flexible enough to accommodate for some adjustments that may be requested by the Commission before the grant agreement signature to ensure complementarity of activities between the lighthouse CSA projects, Prep4Blue, the Mission Implementation Platform, and the project selected under topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-02.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU. Activities to further enhance the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and to further engage with citizens are also covered.",,,,

Scope:A 'New European Bauhaus hub for results and impacts' is required to collect, centralise, manage, monitor and exploit the knowledge produced by the NEB projects, the NEB Community and other relevant NEB actions (e.g. projects resulting from EU-funded calls dedicated to NEB across the different EU programmes, NEB Lab) while also ensuring cooperation and collaboration between them. By having an overview of all the knowledge produced, the progress made, the challenges faced and the research gaps yet to overcome, the hub will be an agile instrument that will contribute to informing the implementation of the NEB Facility and will help to increase its impact. Ultimately, it will contribute to advancing the objectives of the NEB in a coherent manner.It will cover all the disciplines relevant for NEB and reflect the transversal, holistic nature of the initiative.Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Collection of knowledge Develop and implement a methodology and working methods to collect the knowledge, results, processes and solutions resulting from NEB projects, the NEB Community and other relevant NEB actions (e.g. projects resulting from EU-funded calls dedicated or relevant to NEB across the different EU programmes, NEB Lab, etc.) and other relevant initiatives (e.g. EU Missions and their platforms, Built4People innovation clusters, EUI Portico, URBACT Knowledge Hub, etc.);Conduct and set standards for comparative analysis and presentation of knowledge, results, approaches and solutions resulting from NEB projects, the NEB Community and other relevant NEB actions; Knowledge Management Consult the stakeholders inside and outside of the NEB Community that will benefit of the New European Bauhaus Hub for results and impacts and tailor the hub and its actions to their needs;Set up a hub that will centralise, store, process and make publicly available in a user-friendly, tailored and effective way the relevant knowledge produced by NEB projects and NEB relevant actions as well as by the NEB Community;Based on initial information sources and guidance to be provided by the Commission, analyse and develop a consolidated list of EU-funded projects that the Commission will use to build and update a thematic portfolio of projects relevant for the implementation of the NEB initiative in general and for the NEB Facility in particular [1]. Monitoring and analysis Analyse and summarise the results of NEB projects and relevant actions to turn them into actionable knowledge for all different stakeholders (e.g. for urban design, for the revision of spatial development plans, etc.). Ensure its accessibility and attractiveness;Taking 2024 as baseline, develop a monitoring system to measure the impact of future projects funded by the NEB Facility (including their contributions to climate change mitigation and adaption) as well as the progress with the uptake and deployment of their results, approaches and solutions. Links and synergies with existing assessment systems (e.g. Level(s), NEB Labelling Strategy) and relevant tools (notably the NEB Compass) are encouraged;Learning from the results and achievements of all NEB activities, identify the R&I gaps, bottlenecks, and future needs that could be addressed to facilitate the implementation of the NEB Facility. The consortium is expected to develop and provide a method and plan detailing how the New European Bauhaus Hub for results and impacts will be operated, kept up-to-date and adapted to emerging needs. It will also ensure that the hub developed uses European Commission's IT tools such as the Open EUROPA Drupal platform[2] and complies with the Europa Component Library[3], the NEB visual identity and the Commission's accessibility and usability rules. The consortium will also ensure that the Commission can access the back office of the hub's system and that the latter can be transferred to another consortium or the Commission at the end of the project. The project is expected to last at least two years.Proposals should demonstrate how they will secure the necessary knowledge and expertise in areas relevant for the NEB[4]. [1]The project portfolio will be an interactive tool to be developed by the Commission. It will take inspiration in the NEB Dashboard (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/about/dashboard_en) as well as in other thematic project portfolios developed by the Commission.[2]https://github.com/openeuropa[3]Europa Component Library[4]Such as architecture and civil engineering (incl. sustainable and green architecture, adaptive reuse and historic preservation, smart buildings and home automation); spatial planning (incl. landscape architecture) governance and development; entrepreneurship and venture capital; social sciences; culture and creative industries and sectors; emerging industries; research & innovation; climate, energy and natural resources, urban circularity and regeneration; ecosystem services and nature-based solutions; public health and well-being in cities; urban resilience; social impacts of climate change. Additional transversal areas would also be relevant: research and innovation, monitoring & evaluation; (innovation) procurement; advocacy, communications & citizen engagement; digital services, artificial intelligence, machine learning and use of data; knowledge translation, innovation and evidence-informed policymaking.",,"The European Union is moving ahead with its goals to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least net 55% by 2030 while increasing climate resilience. It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[ https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(https://craft-cities.eu/)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[COM(2020) 662 final]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent”, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see 'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe']]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.Innovative funding and financing models are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions. These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.R&I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Covenant of Mayors and past and ongoing relevant projects funded by Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, such as STARTS, as well as with other EU programmes such as LIFE-CET, LIFE-Circular Economy, URBACT, Green City Accord and European Green Capital/Leaf awards.",,,

Activities should contribute to river and habitat continuity, as well as the effect on water quality as addressed within the framework of the Danube River Basin Management Plan. The proposals should also build on research and innovation developed in the current and previous EU framework programmes, such as but not limited to Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe - Work Programme 2023-2024 Missions  (notably with projects selected under topics HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-02 and HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-04; HORIZON-MISS-2022-OCEAN-01-02; HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-02) and relevant LIFE projects, EMFAF/EMFF, EU monitoring programmes and national and regional programmes in the Danube river basin and its delta (e.g. Interreg, ERDF, EU Macroregional Strategies). Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 1 - Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. Proposals should focus on the demonstration of sustainable and effective solutions for the enhancement of a protected network of critical habitats, involving relevant actors at a transnational/national scale and across relevant sectors, relevant national and regional authorities, riparian communities, landscape planners, ecologists as well as concerned economic actors, including fishers.These demonstration activities should appropriately combine measures focused on habitat availability, accessibility and connectivity with measures for the protection and restoration of critical habitats, such as spawning, nursery, feeding and wintering grounds. Activities could also aim at removing pressures to enable natural recovery of fish habitats.  The scale and range of the area for demonstration activities should be ecologically relevant and impactful and based on the recommendations and results of the previously mentioned projects.The measures should be tailored to the specific river section(s) and related habitats and should contribute to improving the good ecological status and ecosystem services provided by key river ecosystems and habitats. Nature-based solutions and building with nature should be prioritised. Training and communication activities addressing stakeholders, including regional and local authorities, as well as the 'associated regions', should be described in each proposal. Local actors, including where appropriate, the European Solidarity Corps and Mission Citizen Assemblies, should be involved in the demonstration activities. Projects funded under this topic should:   Show a significant replication potential by identifying areas and locations where the proposed solutions could be replicable. An action plan and roadmap needed for the replication and scale up of the solutions for fish habitat protection and restoration are expected to be drawn up by the end of the project; Include impact monitoring of the activities addressing fish habitats in the Danube River basin, including its delta, in cooperation with the Information System[6] set up through previous projects such as MEASURES and relevant European Research Infrastructures. In addition, the project is expected to monitor the impacts and effectiveness of demonstration activities at a local scale. The project should link with the activities carried out under the Digital Twin Ocean, in particular those addressing freshwaters, and support data and knowledge sharing through the Ocean and Water Knowledge System, as well as benefiting from it to foster cross-region, pan-European approaches; Provide recommendations and guidance to align protection of migratory fish with regard to new policy measures and infrastructure projects and to strengthen cooperation across relevant sectors (water, navigation, fisheries, hydropower and energy, etc.).  Projects are also expected to integrate actions to support the social and economic transitions towards sustainable, inclusive and long-term management of the restored and protected ecosystems, including natural, social, economic and cultural elements and business models for generating revenue from the restored and protected ecosystems and involve for that purpose local business communities, in particular SMEs, investors and other business stakeholders.  The project funded under this topic should build links with:- other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the lighthouse and its area to maximize synergies as well as with other Mission lighthouses and their activities;  - the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Platform and with the Danube River basin lighthouse support facility and platform, for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area as well as with the Blue Parks technical support platform;  - the activities of the ICPDR as well as with the national and regional authorities with competence in the area of fish habitat conservation and protection.  To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, projects are expected to work with and engage at least 5 'associated regions' to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scalability of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. The concept of 'associated regions' is implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (see the Specific Conditions table for this topic). 'Associated regions' are understood as regions with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to improve fish habitats. The projects should ensure that the 'associated regions' are not already involved in the demonstration sites covered by the projects. The partners should proactively reach out to the 'associated regions' to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those 'associated regions' and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement sustainable, balanced and effective fish habitat protection and connectivity at a river basin scale in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives. Proposals must outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness, in accordance with part B of the general annexes to this work programme. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-7 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU. Activities to further enhance the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and to further engage with citizens are also covered.",,,,

They support the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' dealing with urgent soil health challenges (see in particular specific objectives 1 to 6 and 8 in the Mission implementation plan). Activities should thereby contribute to meeting the European Green Deal ambitions and targets, such as those related to food and nutrition security, climate, biodiversity, environment and rural areas [1].Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.Practice-oriented knowledge and tools are more easily available to land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regard to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies. Scope:While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and 'green” European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.Nowadays, there exist various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users [2]. For the purpose of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', soil health living labs are defined as 'user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption”.Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level [3]. Individual sites could be, e.g., farms, forest stands, urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions.Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as 'places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement”. They are individual, local sites (one farm, one forest exploitation, one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context (e.g., the land use(s), the soil health challenge(s) addressed), applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites. By working together on themes of common interest, the various actors involved in a living lab will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.More specifically, each of the funded projects should:Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, as applicable to the land use(s) and purpose of the project) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s), addressing the same or several land use types. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission's specific objectives [4]. Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, pedo-climatic conditions, land uses, Mission objectives addressed). Living labs exclusively focused on urban areas [5] are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme.Establish, based on the projects' goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s), taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Living labs working in the area of agriculture are expected to promote sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and benefit both conventional and organic farming. Living labs working on forestry, peat and natural areas are expected to address sustainable management for healthy soils in conjunction with productive biomass and other ecosystem services.Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the Soil Mission Implementation Plan and the descriptors of the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience.Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators.Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes. In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach. The list of actors will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and can involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public administrations, representatives of civil society (e.g., consumers, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, depending on their area of expertise. For example, while some partners may lead the conceptual work and coordinate the work within and across living labs, others may focus on carrying-out experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or be involved in outreach activities.To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties [6].Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of actors in one or more of the living labs can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.Applicants are reminded they can benefit from the services of NATI00NS, the project dedicated to support potential applicants to the living labs topics.In order to increase impact and sustainability, applicants are encouraged to explore and test new (or combination with existing) funding schemes and financial instruments, either public or private (including, for example and for agricultural land, Common Agricultural Policy eco-schemes), involving, where relevant, the finance providers such as public authorities or financial institutions and investors.Projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of SOILL[7], the dedicated 'Living Lab Support Structure' established to provide tailor made advice to participants of living labs and lighthouses in their day-to-day operations, as well as enforce the monitoring of their activities in a systematic way, reporting on the main outcomes and experiences [8]. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to collaborate with SOILL as well as with other projects relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s), funded either under the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' or under other parts and pillars of Horizon Europe or other EU programmes, as appropriate. For the latter these would include networking, attendance to meetings and organisation of joint activities (e.g., workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities). The details of the joint activities would be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and the life of the project.Additionally, funded projects should collaborate with BENCHMARKS and AI4SoilHealth, which are key projects looking at sampling, monitoring, validation and further development of indicators and proxy measurements for soil health, as well as using AI technology to accelerate the collection and use of soil health information.Cooperation with relevant networks active at local level, such as EU CAP Network operational groups for agricultural soils, is encouraged in order to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders in living labs activities or in the dissemination of solutions. The projects should also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs), the 'European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition: Agroecology living labs and research infrastructures' or the 'Partnership for Sustainable Food Systems (SFS) for people, planet and climate', which will also support living labs.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work.

Activities will also contribute to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, to the revised EU Pollinators Initiative 'A new deal for pollinators”, to the future EU Nature Restoration Law and the proposed Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive, to the EU Farm to Fork Strategy, including the EU Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production, and to the goals of the UN CBD COP-15. It also directly contributes to the achievement of several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular SDG 15 by halting biodiversity loss and halting and reversing land degradation and SDG2 on food security as activities are expected to improve pollination ecosystem services, which are key for food production.Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Improved knowledge and understanding of the biology and ecology of insect species spending part of their life cycle on or in the soil, with specific focus on ground-nesting pollinators.Better understanding of the major causes of the decline of these insects and the synergistic effects of various threats, including the quantitative and qualitative aspects related to the magnitude of their decline.More effective measures to tackle the loss of soil-dependent insects. Scope:Soil-dependent insects are under threat because of non-adapted soil management practices such as tillage and issues like contamination, compacting or sealing. A better understanding of the causes of their decline and effective measures to tackle them are needed.Pollination is a key ecosystem service for crops and food production. Therefore, a specific focus on pollinating insects is required. Many solitary wasps and 70% of wild bees nest below ground and require protection during this crucial period of their lifecycle. Other ground-nesting pollinators also contribute to soil quality and other ecosystem functions, but little is known about their below ground lives.The 'New Deal for Pollinators” calls for more research to better understand the taxonomic and functional diversity of pollinator communities and their distribution, as well as the threats to pollinators and their interactions.Proposed activities should:Improve the knowledge on the biology, ecology and population dynamics of insects spending part of their life cycle on or in the soil, with specific focus on ground-nesting pollinators, as well as on the interactions between life below and above ground. Focus should be put on lesser-known species, regions and major threats and causes of their decline. The potential buffer and protective role of soil against threats in different soil and land uses, including applied agricultural practices, such as ploughing (e.g., agricultural, forestry, urban and natural areas) should be explored.Contribute to the development of monitoring methods including on threats and pressures that can be of relevance for the pollinator monitoring framework, under the revised EU Pollinators Initiative : 'A New deal for Pollinators”.Identify soil conditions associated with a high diversity of pollinators and map regions of particular importance for the protection of soil-dependent pollinators.Analyse the effects of different soil management practices, including different plant protection and/or soil management methods, across different farming systems, such as organic farming or conventional approaches, and compare intensively managed areas with protected areas.Develop and demonstrate soil remediation and mitigation practices to address the causes of insect (and in particular pollinator) decline.Provide recommendations for best soil management practices to integrate pollinator conservation and restoration across the wider landscape and enhance habitat connectivity and pollination services. Projects should seek potential synergies and capitalise on the results of past or ongoing projects (e.g., Horizon projects Safeguard, PollinERA and WILDPOSH [1]). Furthermore, specific tasks and resources should be envisaged to collaborate and capitalise on activities and results from projects financed under other Work Programme topics of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', in particular BIOservicES and SOB4ES and under the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-06: Harnessing the multifunctional potential of soil biodiversity for healthy cropping systems.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory and the SoilWISE project and the EU Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.International cooperation and links to global conservation actions are encouraged. Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this and future calls of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and should involve at least researchers, landowners and/or land managers, and representatives of civil society notably environmental NGOs. [1]European-funded consortium project that seeks to evaluate the risks of exposure of wild pollinators to pesticides across Europe","Life on earth depends on healthy soils. Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.

Activities will also contribute to the EU-Africa Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture, African Union strategies, initiatives and action plans relevant for soil health and support global commitments and SDGs, in particular in the areas of sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition security, biodiversity, and climate.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Enhanced and accessible data for policy makers and intergovernmental organisations to inform a continental 'convergence of evidence' map that indicates areas in Africa that are likely to be affected by soil degradation processes (as has been implemented for Europe with the EUSO Soil Health Dashboard).Enhanced access to knowledge that can be used by a wide range of stakeholders to inform soil and land management policies and practices, prioritize areas for intervention and research and development, and support improved advisory services for farmers in Africa.Improved datasets are available on soil threats/properties which will contribute to the development of an interactive Soil Health Dashboard for Africa. Scope:Africa has a large degree of degraded soils, suboptimal land use, population growth and increasingly urban population. These factors are contributing to increased competition and pressures on land (less land per farmer, less quality land per farmer, climate change, biodiversity loss) resulting in unfavourable economics of farming and ecosystem management.The IPBES report on land degradation and restoration [1] highlights huge economic cost of land and soil degradation, including increasing cost of no action. Soil health is key to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Therefore, holistic systems approaches are needed for addressing multiple context specific soil health related challenges at country and regional level. In addition, evidence driven analytical framework is urgently needed for adequate soil health priority setting and planning at regional and national level, alignment of partners and investments.Proposed activities should:Develop a scalable Africa-wide soil health dashboard, building on the experience of the EUSO Soil health dashboard, leveraging existing data (e.g., Africa Soil Information System AfSIS [2]) and other EU funded projects such as Soils 4 Africa.Strategic collection of new data to fill soil knowledge gaps (such as pollution, compaction, biodiversity, nutrient status, acidity/acidification, soil organic matter, soil erosion, soil water) and improve the accuracy and functionality of the dashboard through consultative engagement with national stakeholders.Identify critical local/regional thresholds for key soil health descriptors.Develop roadmaps to highlight trends in soil health responses to policy instruments.Support participating African countries in the development of national soil health strategies in at least 8 countries, to better manage soil resources for agriculture and the environment. In developing the strategies, projects should create use cases and provide training opportunities for the interpretation and use of data. Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and SoilWISE and ensure interoperability between the dashboard and other databases (such as national soil information services or the Horizon 2020 project Soils4Africa).Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to build on the work of Soils4Africa and other projects on soil information that are being funded by other entities (e.g., ICARDA), including philanthropic organisations, particularly where there is geographical or thematic complementarity. The Consortium is invited to propose a long-term sustainability plan for the dashboard in Africa.While having a focus on Africa, activities could tap into international expertise (particularly from Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) as deemed necessary.

Scope:Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers undertaking international mobility. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:European Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.Global Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to European nationals or long-term residents[1] who wish to engage in R&I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country. Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025[1].SecondmentsResearchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed one third of the requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to one third of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing phase.Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.Placements in the non-academic sectorPostdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[3]. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[4]. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement. This might affect the final score.Training activitiesThe training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science etc.).Career Development PlanIn order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.EuratomAiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme 2021-2025, are eligible to participate[5].

The future European Cancer Patient Digital Centre (ECPDC)[1] will provide digital services to support cancer patients, survivors and caregivers to facilitate their access to quality information and data sharing. The aim of this action is to design, develop, deploy and operate a pilot information portal of the ECPDC to support the information needs of patients, survivors and caregivers and covering all the spectrum of the cancer patient journey. Specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are developed and implemented to timely update the information provided and facilitate the user experience.Proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed and tailored towards and contribute to the following expected outcomes:The ECPDC information portal is an entry point to quality information for cancer patients, survivors, their families and care givers, covering the cancer patient journey from diagnosis to treatment and post treatment care and life after cancer.The ECPDC information portal complements the Knowledge Centre on Cancer (KCC)[2] by integrating additional trusted information on cancers beyond what is currently available in the KCC.The ECPDC information portal implements human-centric AI-based solutions to manage and systematically update the information provided to the users and to facilitate the user experience. Scope:Proposals should address all the following:Design, develop and deploy, a pilot ECPDC information portal to complement the existing Knowledge Centre on Cancer (KCC). The knowledge base of the information portal will cover the cancer patient journey from diagnosis to life after cancer. It will provide evidence-based information on diagnosis, treatment options (including side-effects and late-effects of treatments such as fatigue, chronic pain, fertility, psychological and other health issues), rehabilitation, management of recurrence and palliative care.The information to include in the knowledge base, complements information provided through the KCC, adding to it and expanding its contents. Attention should be given also onto those cancers with a 5-year overall survival less than 50% from time of diagnosis and as well as to those relevant to paediatric cancers. It relies on scientific evidence and European, international or, where relevant, national guidelines.The selection of the information provided to the users should be based on explicit and robust criteria and be transparent.Provide a validated workflow for reviewing, selecting and timely updating the knowledge base when new clinical information and scientific evidence arise. The development and implementation of human centric AI-based tools may facilitate the reviewing, selecting and updating process.An AI-based virtual assistant is implemented in the portal to interact with users and improve their experience by delivering information tailored to user cultural background, individual (clinical) circumstances, needs, preferences and/or expectations. This virtual assistant should be designed and tested in real-world patient populations for acceptability and value provided. Language should be non-technical and using lay terms.All the developed IT-solutions and workflows should be open source and made available. The involvement of AI-researchers, clinicians, epidemiologists, guideline developers, service design specialists and patient organisation representatives are envisaged.The pilot ECPDC information portal should also include other information that may be relevant to cancer patients and survivors and their families such as options to cross-border health care, participation to clinical research, psychosocial and legal support options, guidance and support for returning to study or to work, financial issues and survivors' rights.To ensure an efficient and useful digital platform for patients, the pilot ECPDC information portal should be tested and validated by an appropriate number of cancer patients and survivors of different cancer types and age groups. Solutions to identified challenges should be provided and implemented. The action will also identify gaps in information relevant to patients and inform policy decisions.A feasibility assessment of linking the pilot ECPDC information portal to the Knowledge Centre on Cancer, including operational solutions and sustainability, should be provided.Regular monitoring, supervision and evaluation by KPIs should be conducted in order to ensure patient benefit. Due consideration should be given to initiatives such as: EU-CAYAS-NET[3]; ERN PaedCan and other relevant EU initiatives.

The objectives include: Understand; Prevent what is preventable; Optimise diagnostics and treatment; Support quality of life; Ensure equitable access in all aforementioned areas. The Mission on Cancer will address all cancers including poorly-understood cancers[[ Includes refractory cancers or cancer subtypes, at any stage of the disease in any age group and part of society with a 5-year overall survival that is less than 50% from time of diagnosis.]] in men and women, cancers in children, adolescents and young adults as well as in the elderly, cancers in socio-economically vulnerable populations, living in either cities, rural or remote areas, across all Member States and Associated countries.The Mission on Cancer is implemented using a health-in-all policies approach[[ Health in All Policies is an approach to public policies across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. https://www.who.int/social_determinants/publications/health-policies-manual/key-messages-en.pdf]]; through infrastructure support; regional, social and citizen community development; through investments; support and commitments from public and private sources, including from Member States, Associated countries and industry; through cooperation with third countries; and through synergies with other existing EU programmes including EU4HEALTH, EURATOM, Digital Europe, Erasmus+, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2021-2027 and other initiatives related to cancer.It also relates to the European Green Deal, including the Farm to Fork strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en]]. The mission proposes research and policy directions and objectives to identify effective strategies for the development and implementation of cancer prevention, including on environmental factors (e.g. exposure to workplace carcinogens, air pollution, unhealthy diet, nutrition and low physical activity).Furthermore, it is also in line with the industrial[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en]] and digitalisation strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en]]. The mission proposes a further upscaling and digitalisation of services, innovation in diagnostics and interventions, and establishing living labs, contributing to the positive impact of efforts by industry and SMEs on the health of citizens. Envisaged opportunities are in the fields of: cancer biomarkers; cloud computing and digital applications, smart apps/sensors. The mission also supports the integration of AI, machine learning and deep learning approaches to facilitate a better understanding of cancer, to improve prevention screening and early detection, diagnosis, clinical decision-making, administration of combinational therapies, and clinical management of patients living with and after cancer.Calls for proposals under this mission should contribute to setting out a credible pathway for implementing the Mission on Cancer, thereby contributing to mission objectives.Proposals for topics under this Mission should set out a credible pathway to improving Cancer control, and more specifically to all of the following impacts:Improve understanding of the development of cancer in the context of the environment, work, and lifestyle in the broadest possible sense,Enhance cross-policy cancer prevention strategies,Optimise the diagnostics and treatment of cancer based on the principle of equitable access,Improve the quality of life of cancer patients, survivors and their families through widely analysing all key factors and needs that are related to the quality of life,Accelerate the digital transformation of research, innovation and health systems. The implementation plan specifies the goal and four main objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission on Cancer[[https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/cancer_implementation_plan_for_publication_final_v2.pdf]].In the calls described below, the Commission envisages several actions[[ The listed areas for potential actions are tentative and non-binding.]]: On the Cancer Mission objective Understanding, the Commission plans to address tumour-host interactions to enhance prevention, treatment and care interventions in poorly-understood childhood as well as adult cancer patients. On the Cancer Mission objective Prevention, the Commission foresees an action on behaviour change. On the Cancer Mission objective Diagnosis and treatment, the Commission envisages an action on minimally invasive diagnostics, which will also improve the quality of life. On the Cancer Mission objective Quality of life, the Commission envisages to enhance the quality of life for survivors of childhood cancer by setting up oncology-centred living labs. The society will benefit from a reduced burden of cancer and solving healthcare barriers.",,,,
HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-03,"Develop and refine outcome indicators to measure progress on climate resilience at national, regional and local levels, including knowledge and feedback developed from the Mission",HORIZON-RIA HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions,HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-24T00:00:00,2024-09-18T17:00:00,,3000000,3000000,1,46925382,46925170HORIZONResearchandInnovationActions1713916800000,"ExpectedOutcome:In support of the European Green Deal, the Adaptation Strategy and the Mission on Adaptation to climate change, successful proposals will contribute to the monitoring of the adaptation progress across Europe.Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:Better capture the state and progress of climate adaptation efforts implemented at local, regional and national levels across European Union and Associated Countries.Better measure the effectiveness of adaptation measures and solutions - analysing social, ecological, and economic benefits and trade-offs, including on just climate resilience.Accelerate the implementation of adaptation efforts across the European Union and Associated Countries, 1) by making the benefits of adaptation actions more visible; and 2) by demonstrating how appropriate governance -- supported by adequate organisational structures -- policy actions and financial planning improve climate resilience. Scope:The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made clear that, despite recent progress, adaptation in Europe is not implemented at the depth, scope and speed needed[1]. As impacts from climate change are increasingly felt, the need for systematic and consistent monitoring of adaptation efforts is becoming more urgent. At the same time, indicators on adaptation outcomes (as opposed to process-related indicators) and adaptive capacity are lacking.This topic aims at strengthening the EU's capacity, knowledge, and involvement of relevant stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation of current adaptation policies. It aims to facilitate policy, financial, corporate, and individual planning and decisions affecting resilience to climate impacts. Lessons learnt from currently available indicators, the literature, efforts underway surveying the use and prospects for indicators within the framework[2] of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and feedback from the experience in the first years of the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change work provide the basis for further developments.Proposals should address all of the following aspects:Develop an integrated framework for monitoring, evaluating, and learning from implemented adaptation measures, as a set. This framework should be based on outcome indicators, i.e., effectively measure levels of climate resilience rather than measuring activities and outputs, as it is often the case. It should consider maladaptation[3] and be useable in all parts of Europe, by relying on common features for the whole of Europe while allowing for regional specificities. It should integrate different kinds of qualitative and quantitative data, methods, and indicators that could rely on satellite imagery, models, or local knowledge. The use of Artificial intelligence systems (e.g., machine learning) is encouraged, if appropriate. Methodology and error assessment should be documented/referenced adequately.Develop or refine earth observation indicators for adaptation, together with a set of visualisation tools. Those indicators should consider governance, social, economic, and environmental aspects, including adaptation of human behaviours to climate change.Complement the data collection with citizen science[4] to help engage and involve all actors and socialize results. To achieve this, proposals should also find ways to engage citizens through citizen science initiatives, in particular vulnerable groups.Develop a strategy to visualize and communicate the benefits of adaptation efforts to the relevant stakeholders.Provide training and dissemination material for different target groups, including regions and local authorities. The project will contribute to the monitoring of the Mission and should therefore feed their results to and collaborate closely with the Mission Implementation Platform[5]. It should build on the work of past and ongoing projects and initiatives, such as the indicator set developed by the REGILIENCE[6] or RESCCUE[7] projects.Additionally operational links and collaboration should be established with the Climate-ADAPT platform[8]; ESPON CLIMATE[9], and the relevant mission projects, in particular CLIMAAX[10] and Pathway2resilience[11]. Linking the project to the second European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA), if confirmed, or any relevant project from Horizon Europe is encouraged. Applicants should acknowledge these requests and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.",,,,

Identification of country-specific challenges and barriers for cities to achieve climate neutrality related to regulatory framework, funding and financing, and governance structures and promotion of best-practices through transnational exchanges and sharing of experience.Enhanced synergies with R&I national/international communities, relevant initiatives, and partnerships such as the 'Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future' Horizon Europe Partnership and the Mission Platform for the implementation of the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission. Scope:Cities are increasingly taking a leading role in the green and digital transition. 100 EU cities and 12 cities from countries associated to Horizon Europe have raised their ambition by joining the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and actively pursuing their transition towards climate-neutrality by 2030. Many more cities across Europe expressed their willingness to engage in climate neutrality pathways and actively engage with the Mission. National and regional authorities have a key role to play to support cities ambition and facilitate the process.The objective of this action is to strengthen existing national networks in Member States and Associated Countries as well as encourage and support the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place and empower them to act as clearly identifiable national contacts to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition and related targets.Such networks by combining relevant multi-level (e.g. national, regional and local) institutional competence and multi-stakeholders capacities, expertise, and responsibilities, would ensure coherence across city-relevant policy, financing and regulatory frameworks and promote higher efficacy and impact of undertaken action plans.The project should build upon, broaden and further upscale the activities, tools, methods, and approaches developed under the CapaCITIES project whilst expanding its geographical coverage to cover preferably the entire EU, enhancing institutional competence by involving all relevant actors and working in close collaboration and complementarity with the Cities Mission Platform.Proposals should:Support the set-up of dedicated national networks in countries where these have not yet been established, preferably covering the entire EU, to help cities in their transition towards climate neutrality and promote collaboration, capacity building and coherence of policy, regulation and financing frameworks across national, regional and local levels.Promote transnational learning, exchanges and training to foster replication and upscaling of best practices across Europe for effective national support mechanisms to support cities in their transitions to climate neutrality.Strengthen the capacity and competence of existing national networks by engaging all relevant institutional players with responsibilities in city-relevant affairs and facilitate exchanges across the national, regional and local levels for policy coherence, better coordination and enhanced impact of city relevant policies, programmes, initiatives, regulatory frameworks and funding.Mobilize and support a large number of urban-relevant authorities, across different ministries and implementing agencies, in engaging together with cities in climate-neutrality transitions in line with the overarching objectives of the European Green Deal, and relevant EU policies;Support capacity building of local authorities and multi-level governance structures for transitions to climate neutrality through dedicated activities such as e.g. trainings, webinars, capacity building, country visits and bi-or multi-lateral exchanges as well as peer-exchange.Identify specific challenges, best-practices and opportunities to make policy and regulatory frameworks, funding and financing and multi-level governance structures best suited for climate neutrality in cities. To avoid unnecessary proliferation of national networks with overlapping competences, duplication of efforts and uncertainty by cities as to which relevant 'interlocutors” to approach, applicants must take into account and build upon existing, planned or ongoing relevant national, regional or local activities and structures aiming to foster climate-neutrality in cities.","The Work Programme 2023-2024 of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in line with the provisions under the Implementation Plan of the Cities Mission, fosters the implementation of the Mission through actions that will continue to provide a strong and direct support to cities that will commit to climate neutrality and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution. In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission LabelClimate City Contracts (CCC) are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it - the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a Mission Label 'to the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC”. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: the Main Commitment Part which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; the Climate Neutral Action Plan which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.The Mission Platform will undertake a completeness check where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the co-creation process in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the consultation of the Mission Board and recommendation from the Mission Owners Group, the Mission Manager will decide whether to endorse the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work ProgrammeClimate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the European Green Deal to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the UN Agenda 2030, the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Fit for 55 strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change, the EU Industrial Strategy, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the New European Bauhaus initiative. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability. The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically, according to their specific focus to the following impacts:Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions;Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems, automation and connectivity;Increased deployment of solutions involving in particular urban greening, renaturing, reducing soil sealing, green/blue infrastructures, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches tackling both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects;Development and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District and improved knowledge on the necessary (replicable) elements and processes needed to make first a district and subsequently a whole city climate-neutral;Improved urban public space connectivity and accessibility of different urban districts and neighbourhoods by integrating multimodality and new (shared) services within the urban public space layout and infrastructure;Improved methods for assessing exposure to air, water, soil & noise pollution, particularly of vulnerable groups, informing health impact assessment focusing on the (co-)benefits and socio-economic impacts of zero pollution measures combined with climate neutrality policies;Better understanding and enhanced societal acceptance of sustainable mobility management schemes, including guidance and recommendations for national, regional and local authorities, EU institutions, public and private organisations;Improved sustainable development of peri-urban areas through the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures to achieve climate-neutrality;Increased preparedness and capacity of national, regional and local authorities in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe to engage in cities' transition towards climate neutrality;Increased capacity among European cities, with particular attention to those selected under the Cities Mission, to design and roll out their Climate City Contracts, including related investment plans and to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030.

Mission Adaptation to Climate Change assessment report”[2].Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:The project serves information and offers the latest available solutions on adaptation to climate change to regional and local authorities, namely via a number of multilingual communications products, services and activities. It does so by closely cooperating with and under the umbrella of the Mission Implementation Platform[3], which continues to be stakeholders' main contact point to engage with Adaptation Mission.Knowledge and understanding of the policy implications of adaptation solutions is increasingly utilised in the policy cycles at EU, national, and regional and local levels.The wide range of solutions tested and deployed in the context of the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change and the good practices emerged in its Community of Practice are harvested, analysed and systematised to support the implementation of the Mission.The Mission actors (i.e., Secretariat and regions and local authorities participating in the Adaptation Mission) get comprehensive and structured information on available solutions identified, developed, tested, and deployed via relevant funding programmes and at various level of governance. Such comprehensive and structured information is also shared with the 'National Adaptation Hubs” created by HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-02, in cooperation and coordination with the Mission Implementation Platform. Scope:Regional, local authorities are the target group of the proposed activities and the customers of the in-depth knowledge provision on solutions; as such they are not expected to participate as part of the consortium, but they should receive tailor made services from the project funded by this action, which should primarily use the Mission Implementation Platform's channels to feed them with new information products, also based on the needs (already) expressed by them (e.g. see Analysis of information provided by the signatories of the charter of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change when adhering to the Charter[4]).It is expected that the project will have a duration of about 2 years.The proposal should address all of the following aspects:Support and closely cooperate with the ongoing Mission Implementation Platform, in close contact with the Mission's Secretariat, to avoid duplications and by structurally analysing and summarising the good practices shared and discussed by regions and local authorities in the context of the Mission Implementation Platform's Community of Practice, both as part of Community of Practice's events and as part of the online discussion in the Mission Portal's restricted webpages. Moreover, where possible, the project will seek to use existing channels to serve information products to Mission's regions and local authorities so as to avoid duplications, namely using those established by the Mission Implementation Platform and in the Mission Portal.Seek cooperation with existing platforms and initiatives fostering climate adaptation in EU Member States and Associated Countries (in particular the Mission Portal[5] hosted by the European Environment Agency, the NCP4missions[6] and the TRAMI[7] projects or followers). This is to avoid duplication of efforts and make sure Mission's regions and local authorities have easy access to such information and communications products. In particular, any communications action should be integrated as much as possible into the existing Mission portal, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency. Moreover, particular attention should also be given to make appropriate links with the Joint Research Centre's Risk Data Hub[8], if relevant. Produce a detailed inventory of adaptation solutions, in coordination with the Mission Implementation Platform, in which each solution should be classified according to how it could help to address the needs of the biogeographical zones or most recurring climate risks. The results of such an inventory should be made available, also leveraging the Mission Implementation Platform, to all local, regional and national players, so to facilitate their access to all scientific available previous knowledge. The solutions should be analysed, and their inventory structured in line with the Mission Implementation Plan[9]'s approach (in particular, adopting a priority scope along the Plan's 'key community systems and enabling conditions”) in view of ensuring maximum coherence. These solutions should also be proactively promoted with the regions and local authorities participating in the Adaptation Mission.Local, regional and even national players who have already financed and/or experimented with solutions may also need to be given the opportunity to 'publicize” effective solutions that can be scaled up or replicated elsewhere.Give particular attention to available solutions at National, regional and local levels, including those of cross-border nature. As the current scope and support by the Mission Implementation Platform to the Community of Practice is limited in terms of number of regions and local authorities involved, the proposal should also identify and analyse available solutions in regions that are not directly involved with the Mission's Community of Practice - and in turn feed those to the Community of Practice discussions. To retrieve such information, the project funded under this topic is expected to closely cooperate with the project stemming from the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-02 and the different projects in the Adaptation Mission Portfolio. It should closely build on solutions identified or discussed along the multi-level governance axis (also defined as 'National hubs”), in turn supporting it with hands-on knowledge products that can be disseminated within its own structures. This cooperation will also be key to ensure that information-sharing targeting the regions and the local authorities is also tailored to the specific National governance context, to maximize its impacts and provide a basis for transforming information-sharing into building up know-how and skills.The proposals should identify and harvest knowledge and solutions from relevant Horizon Europe projects, with particular attention to projects funded by the Adaptation Mission calls (including demonstrators) and projects identified as 'mission-relevant' in other EU funding programme (e.g., LIFE, Interreg) or legacy projects from Horizon2020 or FP7, as well as from partnerships, and from the other EU Missions, in particular the cities, soil and ocean missions. The proposals should also build on previous analyses or information already harvested by mission-relevant projects, in particular past and ongoing coordination and support actions (including but not limited to Regilience[10], NetworkNaturePlus[11], MAIA[12], MAGICA[13]). This is to avoid duplications of efforts and to improve the overall understanding of the wide range of solutions available to regions and local authorities.As the scope of the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change goes beyond Horizon Europe, the proposal should also structurally consider solutions identified, developed, tested, and deployed via other relevant funding programmes (in particular the EU cohesion policy incl. ERDF, INTERREG, as well as LIFE Programme, the Digital Europe Programme, etc.), initiatives (including Cohesion4Transitions, etc.), and actors (JRC, EIB, EBRD, etc.). Moreover, the scope should not be limited to EU programmes and initiatives only, but rather look at National and regional opportunities as well (funding programmes, national or regional hubs or initiatives, including the potential of relevant business-led or private initiatives).Develop multilingual operational information and communication products aiming at facilitating regions and local authorities' understanding of the said solutions and their effectiveness, through a dedicated communications strategy tailored to the different target audiences within the regions and local authorities (in particular policy makers, practitioners and social partners). The proposals should also provide tools to support the authorities in the development and implementation of such solutions in their regional and local contexts (i.e., know-how).When bringing available solutions to the knowledge of the regions and of the local authorities, the proposal should also include a dedicated task aiming at feeding the EU policy cycle by identifying good practices that merit particular attention by EU policymakers in view of strengthening policy innovation in coming cycles (feedback to policy task).

Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.",,,,

Scope:This topic will contribute to the achievement of the Mission's objective to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, survivors and their families. The focus should be exclusively on adolescent and young adult (AYA, age range 15-39)[2] cancer patients and survivors.Each year, more than 150,000 AYA cancers are diagnosed in the EU, and over 1.2 million worldwide. About 300,000 AYA patients live with or beyond cancer in the EU; the majority experience late-effects due to their cancer treatment, including chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, organ and skin alterations, cosmetic sequelae, fertility problems, cognitive and functional impairment, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Survivors may also be at increased risk of second cancers due to the long-term effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The negative impact on education and employment of AYA survivors and in general the financial burden borne by them is also commonly observed.Late effects are particularly challenging for AYA cancer survivors, who often experience them during a critical phase of their lives. Late effects are also challenging for caregivers. The considerable progress made in treating AYA cancers has further exposed gaps in the understanding, prevention and management of late-effects, which warrant more targeted pan-European research on AYA cancer survivorship.Proposals should focus on one or more cancer types and address only one of the following interventions:Building on data from existing or newly established AYA patient cohorts, ensuring comparability of data across participating countries as appropriate, obtain a thorough assessment by cancer type of the prevalence, specific effect(s), severity, time of onset, relative risk, and risk factors associated to late effects in AYA cancer patients. Attention should be paid also to social and health determinants, including sex, gender, age and other relevant variables, including socio-economic status, living in rural or remote areas and education;Develop, test and scale-up evidence-based screening methods for the early detection of late-effects in AYA cancer patients;Develop, test and scale up in real-life settings, innovative, holistic approaches and tools (including digital tools), optimising cancer treatment and follow-up regimens to prevent, reduce and/or effectively manage late-effects, including psycho-social aspects. Approaches could focus on education, sports, nutrition, medical follow-up and counselling, for example on mental and physical health, pain management, and wellbeing in general, as well as reproductive matters, including infertility, onco-fertility and fertility options in general and development of effective methods for fertility preservation and guidelines on related counselling. This topic requires direct involvement of cancer patients and survivors, survivor representative organisations, caregivers, and the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant results, enhancing the impact of the related research activities.The use of participative research models, such as oncology-centred living labs or other approaches to deliver (social) innovation should be considered.Due consideration should be given to EU-funded initiatives such as: EU-CAYAS-NET[3]; ERN PaedCan[4]; PanCareFollowUp[5]; PanCareSurPass[6]; EUonQoL[7]; e-Quol[8]; STRONG-AYA[9] [10].The Commission will facilitate coordination. Therefore, successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Quality of Life' cluster for the Mission on Cancer established in 2023[11] and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings, and potential joint activities without the prerequisite to give details of these at this stage. Examples: organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate.

The objectives include: Understand; Prevent what is preventable; Optimise diagnostics and treatment; Support quality of life; Ensure equitable access in all aforementioned areas. The Mission on Cancer will address all cancers including poorly-understood cancers[[ Includes refractory cancers or cancer subtypes, at any stage of the disease in any age group and part of society with a 5-year overall survival that is less than 50% from time of diagnosis.]] in men and women, cancers in children, adolescents and young adults as well as in the elderly, cancers in socio-economically vulnerable populations, living in either cities, rural or remote areas, across all Member States and Associated countries.The Mission on Cancer is implemented using a health-in-all policies approach[[ Health in All Policies is an approach to public policies across sectors that systematically takes into account the health implications of decisions, seeks synergies, and avoids harmful health impacts in order to improve population health and health equity. https://www.who.int/social_determinants/publications/health-policies-manual/key-messages-en.pdf]]; through infrastructure support; regional, social and citizen community development; through investments; support and commitments from public and private sources, including from Member States, Associated countries and industry; through cooperation with third countries; and through synergies with other existing EU programmes including EU4HEALTH, EURATOM, Digital Europe, Erasmus+, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2021-2027 and other initiatives related to cancer.It also relates to the European Green Deal, including the Farm to Fork strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/food/farm2fork_en]]. The mission proposes research and policy directions and objectives to identify effective strategies for the development and implementation of cancer prevention, including on environmental factors (e.g. exposure to workplace carcinogens, air pollution, unhealthy diet, nutrition and low physical activity).Furthermore, it is also in line with the industrial[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-industrial-strategy_en]] and digitalisation strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age_en]]. The mission proposes a further upscaling and digitalisation of services, innovation in diagnostics and interventions, and establishing living labs, contributing to the positive impact of efforts by industry and SMEs on the health of citizens. Envisaged opportunities are in the fields of: cancer biomarkers; cloud computing and digital applications, smart apps/sensors. The mission also supports the integration of AI, machine learning and deep learning approaches to facilitate a better understanding of cancer, to improve prevention screening and early detection, diagnosis, clinical decision-making, administration of combinational therapies, and clinical management of patients living with and after cancer.Calls for proposals under this mission should contribute to setting out a credible pathway for implementing the Mission on Cancer, thereby contributing to mission objectives.Proposals for topics under this Mission should set out a credible pathway to improving Cancer control, and more specifically to all of the following impacts:Improve understanding of the development of cancer in the context of the environment, work, and lifestyle in the broadest possible sense,Enhance cross-policy cancer prevention strategies,Optimise the diagnostics and treatment of cancer based on the principle of equitable access,Improve the quality of life of cancer patients, survivors and their families through widely analysing all key factors and needs that are related to the quality of life,Accelerate the digital transformation of research, innovation and health systems. The implementation plan specifies the goal and four main objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission on Cancer[[https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/cancer_implementation_plan_for_publication_final_v2.pdf]].In the calls described below, the Commission envisages several actions[[ The listed areas for potential actions are tentative and non-binding.]]: On the Cancer Mission objective Understanding, the Commission plans to address tumour-host interactions to enhance prevention, treatment and care interventions in poorly-understood childhood as well as adult cancer patients. On the Cancer Mission objective Prevention, the Commission foresees an action on behaviour change. On the Cancer Mission objective Diagnosis and treatment, the Commission envisages an action on minimally invasive diagnostics, which will also improve the quality of life. On the Cancer Mission objective Quality of life, the Commission envisages to enhance the quality of life for survivors of childhood cancer by setting up oncology-centred living labs. The society will benefit from a reduced burden of cancer and solving healthcare barriers.",,,,
HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-02,Bringing together the national level with the engaged regional and local levels (multi-level governance),HORIZON-CSA HORIZON Coordination and Support Actions,HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-24T00:00:00,2024-09-18T17:00:00,,4000000,4000000,1,46925382,46925143HORIZONCoordinationandSupportActions1713916800000,"ExpectedOutcome:In support of the European Green Deal, the Adaptation Strategy and the Mission on Adaptation to climate change, the successful proposal will specifically complement and reinforce the work of the Mission Implementation Platform, by addressing Missions' current untapped potential, as highlighted in Commission's Communication COM(2023) 457 final[1] and underlying ”Study supporting the assessment of EU missions and the review of mission areas. Mission Adaptation to Climate Change assessment report”[2].More specifically, the successful project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:The national relevant governance for innovation and climate adaptation is further engaged and mobilised to contribute to the objectives of the EU Mission on adaptation to climate change, and benefit from it.The EU Mission is deeply connected with national multi-level governance feeding into Member States, regions and local authorities' efforts to implement the European Climate Law's requirements on climate adaptation, and to further develop and update their national, regional and local adaptation plans. A set of 'National Adaptation Hubs' bridge the gap between the EU and regional/local levels, in the Adaptation mission and further disseminate the solutions emerging from the Mission to other regions and local authorities that are not Charter Signatories.A robust twinning scheme grouping of regions and local actors facing similar challenges ensures peer-learning and cross-fertilisation of experiences, further strengthening ongoing peer learning opportunities within the EU Mission, and also providing a tool to disseminate EU Mission's knowledge beyond the regions and local authorities directly participating in the EU Mission. Scope:Regional and local authorities are the target groups of the proposed activities and as such they are not expected to participate directly in the consortium, but they should receive services from the project funded by this action.In order to achieve the indicated scope, the project could provide direct financial support in the form of grants to maximum one entity in each of the MS in facilitating the creation and animation of the 'National Adaptation Hub”. To implement the support to third parties, the consortium should include partners with relevant operational and financial experience and viability.It is expected that the project will have a duration of about 2 years.Proposals should address two axes of action: 1) establishing and managing so-called 'National adaptation hubs”; and 2) implementing a structural grouping scheme as organic component of the multi-governance approach.For each of the axes of action, proposals should address all the following aspects identified : National adaptation hubs Identify relevant actors at National level, in cooperation with existing national experts/working groups (such as Climate Advisory bodies[3] or members of the Working Group on adaptation of the Horizon Europe Strategic Programme Committee and the Working Group on Adaptation (WGA) under the Climate Change Committee or the managing authorities of the cohesion policy or rural development funds), as well as at regional and local level, to facilitate the connection and integration of the Mission's approach at national level.Concretely, proposals should aim at mobilising National, regional, and local actors and foster the creation of dedicated 'National adaptation hubs” for the EU Mission on adaptation to climate change. Such hubs (one per country) consist in a sort of task force or working group composed of the relevant contact points from each level of governance relevant in the individual countries. Those structures are meant to be light, agile, and flexible, to be tailored to the national context. Some countries are already piloting national structures aiming at supporting and complementing the EU Mission at national level (in some cases with more formal and complex structures than the flexible working groups foreseen in this project). In such cases National hubs would consist or would be an integration of such existing structures, which can be served by the project via information products or logistic support in view of helping them to better align and cooperate with the Adaptation Mission. If relevant in the national context, some of those hubs could also tackle the interface between climate adaptation and mitigation by integrating or cooperating with any existing structure dedicated this objective.Foster knowledge and solutions sharing and implement dedicated horizontal supporting actions, such as help shaping the National adaptation hubs identifying and connecting national and subnational priorities, create multilingual horizontal information and communication products to help feed the feedback-loop between Adaptation Mission and the National adaptation hubs, including by identifying good practices exchanged as part of the grouping scheme.To retrieve such information, the project funded under this topic is expected to closely cooperate with the project stemming from the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-01 and the different projects in the Adaptation Mission Portfolio, under the coordination of the Mission Implementation Platform.Ensure that the knowledge gained by the regions directly participating in the Adaptation Mission is shared with other regions within a certain Member State, further disseminating such knowledge via their own existing channels. These hubs can, in fact, be a first step to bring EU Mission's knowledge to the regions and local authorities that are not directly participating in EU Mission's activities, while the EU Mission continues to work with a limited set of regions and local authorities as testbeds for climate adaptation solutions.National adaptation hubs should also feed and contribute to countries and regional and local authorities' efforts related to the adaptation objectives in the Climate Law - with particular reference to the adoption and implementation of national adaptation strategies and plans. National adaptation hubs should support the implementation of adaptation plans, liaising with the relevant national, regional or local authorities to integrate the knowledge developed within the Mission into the development and selection process of projects on the ground, in particular when financed by EU funds. Moreover, in this light, they should also help connect public authorities with existing support opportunities such as TAIEX-EIR PEER 2 PEER[4], the Commission's Technical Support Instrument, etc.Build on existing relevant initiatives, such as the TRAMI project[5] [or followers] and the NCP4missions[6], the new National Contact Points Network, as well as other relevant thematic national hubs, to avoid duplications, ensure horizontal synergies and complement existing structures when relevant for the Adaptation Mission. The proposal should also ensure close collaboration with the Mission Implementation Platform[7], which, at the moment, does not foresee specific budget to organise activities at National level. In such context, the project will remain in close contacts with the Mission's Secretariat. The project will connect the exchange done via the EU Mission's Community of Practice (managed by the Mission Implementation Platform) with the subsequent follow-ups, dissemination, and further discussion at 'National adaptation hubs” level, effectively connecting and helping the coordination of their activities. Moreover, the project should also ensure that National adaptation hubs connect with the EU Mission Board, to fully exploit further synergies with its members. Build on the EU Mission's key community systems and enabling conditions[8] to identify the priority areas of work of the 'National adaptation hubs”, by engaging and exchanging with the National and regional contact points. These priority areas should reflect what is included in the National Strategies and/or Plans on Adaptation to Climate Change. In addition, the action should also identify areas of exchange that are particularly suited for discussion at National level (such as the concept of just transition, including by addressing the social angle of adaptation to climate change) or where existing gaps require specific attention (such as access to finance), or there is high potential for cooperation (the nexus climate adaptation and mitigation).Last, National adaptation hubs could be suited to engage with the private sector at national, regional, local level. They should also involve climate pact ambassadors (when relevant), to help amplifying the impacts of these initiative with the civil society. Grouping scheme To facilitate the concrete dissemination of knowledge, the proposal should foresee a structural grouping scheme. In particular, the scheme should bring together regions and local actors facing similar challenges, and it should help consolidate the multi-level governance. Such scheme might see groups or pairs from the same Member State (to feed the knowledge sharing within each 'national adaptation hubs” and cascade knowledge across a national territory) or between different countries. In turn, the proposal should ensure close connections with the Mission's Community of Practice.The grouping exercise will also help disseminating the Mission's knowledge beyond the regions directly served by the Mission - hence substantiating the new 'multi-level governance”. In this context, the proposal should identify the right grouping and pairing participants able to bring the knowledge they acquired by participating in Mission-funded and Mission-related activities (for example, when testing adaptation solutions as part of Mission projects' work) to other regions in the EU, with particular attention to vulnerable regions. Moreover, in some cases the scheme might group and /or pair, depending on demand, less advanced regions with front-runners. When developing the scheme, the proposal should ideally involve the National level into the peer learning scheme, including by ensuring that the best practices shared via the grouping scheme can also feed the National level in view of policy innovation (see point on Climate Law requirements). Likewise, the grouping should be equally open and encouraged for Mission's signatories to be clustered and/ or paired with other Mission's signatories so as to complement ongoing matchmaking and peer learning efforts as part of the Mission Implementation Platform, and other Mission's initiatives.

Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.",,,,

Scope:While evidence suggests that there is financing available to address climate adaptation[1], it is also evident that there is a shortage of bankable opportunities. Most promising climate adaptation projects rely on grants and public investments for their development. In many cases, while they benefit the public good, they struggle to prove any profitability and they risk getting abandoned at the end of the project when the initial financing comes to an end.The European Investment Bank has shown that climate projects succeeding in securing investments are very rarely only addressing adaptation to climate change and in most of the cases they rather add a climate proofing component to a bigger project (for example, over dimensioning of an urban sewage system to take into account future scenarios of extreme rainfall events). The integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation theoretically provides co-benefits: efficiencies in the project implementation can provide capital savings (e.g., realising a green space for a city provides also water storage capacity in addition to a recreational opportunity); the mitigation component of the project can provide measurable outcomes in shorter timelines, reducing the scientific uncertainty of future climate scenarios. Furthermore, implementation can be faster as benefits can be faster monetized, and social acceptance facilitated.Proposals should identify financially valuable cases of climate projects including climate adaptation dimension on top of other benefits, while safeguarding the principle of do-not significantly harm any environment objective (such as, biodiversity and ecosystems, freshwater etc). They should develop and test solutions, based on technological, social and / or business innovation, that deliver at once an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change in the involved regions, cities, local authorities and communities, while also contributing to reduce or neutralise carbon emissions, improve water efficiency and/or safeguard biodiversity. To prove the financial viability of the proposed solutions, proposals should include business and/or investor partners and/or private sector actors (for example from the financial and / or insurance sector) in the consortium, interested in investing in the project (by participating directly in the consortium) as more resilient / less risky / more sustainable and assuring that they will maintaining the solutions in place beyond the duration of the project.The proposed solution should address specific climate vulnerabilities identified as relevant at regional and local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account place-based data, socio-economic, identity characteristics and local governance.Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities (sharing common climate challenges), where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating” regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating” regions. Replicating regions are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities already in the course of the project but they should at least prepare, the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects[2]. Those previous projects and initiatives that address climate change adaptation can be funded by National programmes; EU programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe), as well as the LIFE and Cohesion programmes but can also come from beyond the EU. Moreover, proposals should look into opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across the European Union through the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, and through the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects should also connect to the work of the Climate Resilience Dialogue[3] and link to the EU's sustainable finance agenda and taxonomy work and the use of sustainable investment ratings, when relevant.Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with the Mission Implementation Platform[4] and the Climate-ADAPT platform[5] and should also link with projects awarded under the topic HORIZON-MISS-2022-CLIMA-01-02 on 'Unlocking of financial resources for investments into climate resilience”.Projects funded under this topic will get direct access to participate in the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Under the facilitation of Mission Implementation Platform, projects might provide an ideal space to improve cooperation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) on adaption finance. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

Scope:Despite efforts to adapt to climate change in Europe, the most vulnerable people in society are still the most affected, due to their age, health, place of residence, or socio-economic status [1], while often contributing the least to climate change. Projected climate change, an ageing society and persisting socio-economic inequalities mean that differences in vulnerability and exposure to climate change are likely to continue. In addition, adaptation responses may worsen existing inequalities or even create new ones.Vulnerable and marginalised groups are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change, especially high temperature and flooding. Moreover, nearly half of city hospitals and schools are in areas with strong urban heat island effects, thus exposing their vulnerable users to high temperatures. With approximately 10% of schools and 11% of hospitals across Europe located in potential flood-prone areas, the areas at higher risk of floods tend to have higher proportions of disadvantaged people than areas at lower risk of floods.The climate adaptation measures in place do not benefit everyone in society to the same extent. For example, the most vulnerable groups tend to have lower access to green spaces and are least able to pay for flood insurance or flood-proofing measures.Proposals should identify, develop, test and demonstrate equitable adaptation actions and solutions, increasing adaptive capacity, reducing vulnerability and risks and addressing specific climate vulnerabilities identified as relevant at regional and local scale, taking into account place-based climate data, socio-economic information, and local governance.Proposals should specifically address how the most vulnerable[2] groups in relation to their age, gender, health, socio-economic status or other social vulnerability characteristic would be catered for. This should include how these groups are identified; how they are meaningfully included in the development of the adaptation actions (process); and in what ways they are expected to benefit from these actions (outcome).Regional and/or local authorities should be directly involved in the development of equity-oriented policies and measures so as to assure their up-take during the course of the project and their continuous application beyond the end of the project. As a limited capacity and availability for engagement of the target groups might prevent them from directly participating in the consortium, the proposal should include specific considerations on how to ensure that insights from the target group are reflected in the project; how solutions can be co-designed with the target group; and on how the outcomes and results can be used on the ground. Proposals should also leverage the methodologies and approaches toolbox for citizens engagement made available by other projects [in particular CLIMAS[3] and AGORA[4] funded by the Horizon Europe Mission Work Programme], and initiatives [such as the JRC Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy], and by the Missions Implementation Platform[5].Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions / local communities, the proposals should already identify other regions/local communities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating” regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating” regions. Replicating regions are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare in the course of the project the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.Proposals should build (when relevant) upon existing knowledge and lessons learnt on questions of climate justice, vulnerability and inequality including from other regions in the world. Similarly, they should build on adaptation solutions designed and previously developed from previous projects addressing climate change adaptation, funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme and also beyond EU. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds or the Just Transition Fund. Regions with Territorial Just Transition Plans are encouraged to participate in this call to strengthen their climate adaptation capacity, secure the sustainability of regional investments and avoid maladaptation.”Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with Mission Implementation Platform and Climate-ADAPT[6].Projects funded under this topic will get direct access to participate in the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources. In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to the Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.

Scope:The growing complexity, interdependencies and interconnectedness of modern societies and economies require that climate action is tackled with a systemic approach. Effectively adapting to climate change relies on cross-sectoral approaches, looking at the system as a whole, and on the inclusion of a variety of actors.Proposals should integrate multi-faceted technological, digital, business, governance and environmental aspects with social innovation into the development of solutions contributing to increase preparedness to changing climate for specific regions, cities or local communities. For example, they should assess and identify management solutions that best minimise and compensate the loss of ecosystem services (e.g., water cycling and cooling that were previously provided by soil and trees) while improving climate preparedness. The proposed solution should address climate risk identified as relevant at regional and local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account place-based data, socio-economic, identity characteristics, local governance and the regional sustainable and smart specialization strategies when available.In its approach, the proposed solution should go 'far beyond addressing a specific sector', taking into account and addressing wide-ranging impacts. It should take a systemic approach, looking at the interconnections and interdependencies between them. For example, proposals could explore solutions addressing the interlinkages between climate, water, food, soil, biodiversity loss and others, which form a nexus where resource use and availability rely heavily on one another. Considering the current increasing trend of water scarcity (periods of drought followed by storms and floods, with a decreasing overall annual precipitations) tackling the pollution problem linked to these extreme climate events would be relevant. Another example of systemic approach can relate to the integration of multilevel planning, which integrates spatial and urban planning with the design of different services such as transport, mobility, energy, connectivity in a city. Interesting examples in this sense may come for instance from the New European Bauhaus initiative, which intends to accelerate the green transition by combining sustainability with inclusion and aesthetics/quality of experience.Interconnections and interdependencies need to be well understood and are further complicated as amplitude of climate change in the future is uncertain. In the medium and long term, for example, we know that climate change will affect water availability and crop yields with wide-ranging implications and that certain adaptation options (such as broader use of desalination for provision of drinking water to cope with water scarcity) can be energy intensive which compounds the problem of global warming, have local impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems, have side-effects that impact the environment (as is the case of brine from desalination, or water abstractions to produce hydrogen). Furthermore, it is not known to which level those adaption options could be implemented locally based on the relevance of the expected impacts or would be bashed away.Proposals should look to how tackle and possibly minimise trade-offs, maximise co-benefits and leverage opportunities a systemic approach offers to address the challenges of a changing climate in the specific local context. In doing this, they should produce state-of-the-art- analysis in a multidisciplinary approach addressing the science-policy nexus; they should go beyond theoretical research and/or theoretical discussions or the pure understanding and quantifying of the links between the different elements and sectors. On the contrary, proposals should turn them into operational and practical insights and tangible solutions experimented on the regional and local grounds, clearly addressing trade-offs and co-benefits, with a view of achieving optimum outcomes. Proposals should also consider how to turn the proposed solutions into new standards so to allow faster uptake at scale.In addition, proposals should mobilise and include all value chain actors and pay careful attention to matching innovators and solutions providers with end-users/regions interested in testing and further developing the proposed solutions on the ground; they should also foster the development of business models that can support the sustainability of the proposed solutions.Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges.

Scope:Climate change and biodiversity loss are two interdependent crises that are complex, cascading, and compounding. Tackling them in an effective way must rely on a much more systemic approach than what has been achieved so far, which requires a better understanding of their interdependencies and feedback loops.This topic aims at: Better understanding how the climate and biodiversity crises interact, how they reinforce each other and how they are best addressed together.Building tools and designing solutions to break siloes and address multiple risks stemming from the climate and biodiversity crises in a systemic way, maximising the synergies and minimising the trade-offs between both crises. To achieve those goals, proposals should address all of the following aspects:Investigate case studies on cascading, compound climate risks triggered by extreme weather and climate events, as well as slow onset event in relation to changes in biodiversity, ecosystem services, food security, natural resources and water systems.Investigate case studies on how biodiversity loss accelerates climate change or reduces resilience to climate change (by increasing vulnerability and exposure).identify co-benefits of the implementation of nature-based solution for adaptation to climate change and for biodiversity conservation and restoration.Identify and evaluate maladaptation actions or negative impacts of climate adaptation options on other aspects or sectors, particularly on biodiversity and, conversely, identify and evaluate how biodiversity restoration actions might negatively impact climate adaptation capacity.Look into how the combination of climate adaptation and biodiversity actions reinforce or weaken each other and how the combined effect of adaptation and biodiversity actions differs from the sum of individual actions.All of the above should lead to the identification of actions that simultaneously halt the loss of and restore biodiversity and enhance the resilience of societies and ecosystems in a changing climate. In other words, proposals should provide concrete policy recommendations (e.g., the field of land use, spatial and urban planning, etc.) that address the biodiversity and climate crises in a more systemic way and that minimise trade-offs between different risks. To ensure that the knowledge produced by the projects useful to policymakers, proposals should present a credible plan to engage with public administrations at various levels, including regional/local authorities and to pass on the information to them.Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with Mission Implementation Platform[3]; the Climate-ADAPT platform[4]; and the Joint Research Centre's Risk Data Hub[5].Linking the project to the second European Climate Risk Assessment, if confirmed, or any relevant project from Horizon Europe is encouraged.Additionally, proposals should build on and connect to other relevant projects funded by Horizon Europe, in particular projects CLIMAAX[6], MYRIAD-EU[7], ACCREU[8], SPARCCLE[9], as well as the projects funded by the 'HORIZON-CL4-2023-SPACE-01-31: Copernicus for Atmosphere and Climate Change, including CO2”, and Horizon Europe Cluster 6 projects on biodiversity, including the European Partnership for Biodiversity (Biodiversa+), and on nature-based solutions.Finally, proposals should explore synergies with the projects funded under the topic 'HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-09: Systemic and cross-sectoral solutions for climate resilience, tailored to the specific needs of regions and local authorities” of this call.

Successful proposals will support the European Green Deal, the Adaptation Strategy, the Mission on Adaptation to climate change and the implementation of the long-term vision for the EU's rural areas. Scope:While many larger cities and regions have identified the potential impacts of climate change in their territories and have in many cases already developed adaptation scenarios, their smaller and medium-sized counterparts often lack the necessary resources for conducting climate risks analysis and planning and have so far been limited in addressing climate risks effectively. As a very large number of localities are indeed small or medium in size, with large and rural territories, their lack of preparedness translates in a crucial weakness of the overall continent preparedness and response to the changing climate. The shortage of skilled labour and in particular of experts with climate assessment and environmental skills prevent a majority of municipalities from implementing local investments[2].This capacity limitation, coupled with the typical large territorial responsibility of the involved authorities and the very diverse risks they are exposed, makes in many cases difficult to leverage efficiencies of scale as it is the case in more densely populated areas. This has unluckily translated in many cases into more deadly impacts of extreme weathers events in relation to the population exposed.Proposals should identify approaches and innovative solutions leading to an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change which are particularly suitable for implementation by small and medium local authorities and the rural context. These solutions could include technological, social and business-related aspects or a combination of those. Nature-based solutions should be explored as priority and be at the very heart of the development whenever possible. Moreover, particular attention should be given to the potential of digital solutions in a rural or small/medium size population entity context, to also support their twin digital transition. Opportunities of circular economy to increase resilience and reduce dependencies should be seized[3].The proposed solutions should specifically address the most urgent climate risks identified at the local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account local specificities, such as, socio-economic, identity characteristics and governance. Alongside the solutions, the proposal should support small and medium local authorities to close skills gaps and strengthen in-house capabilities for climate adaptation. To best focus the approaches and solutions to the local challenges, the proposal is expected to clearly identify the type of actors it addresses, being those either rural areas or small sized urban areas.The participation of small and medium-sized local authorities in the consortium is strongly encouraged and would be evaluated positively as this can support the development in-house capacities and skills. However, as the capacity and availability for engagement of small / medium size local communities and in the rural area might be too limited to directly participate in the consortium, the proposal should at a minimum include specific considerations on how to facilitate their engagement and how their needs are reflected. This could take, for example, the form of a board or of a consultation body where they are directly engaged singularly or in association and/or grouping between themselves, should this be the preferred approach and form for the local authorities to delegate specific local competences, or could be achieved potentially leveraging the support already put in place by the Mission Implementation Platform[4].Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three locations, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating” regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating” regions. Replicating regions/local authorities/communities are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare already the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, or the Just Transition Fund.Additionally, proposals should connect to other relevant projects funded by Horizon- Europe, in particular on just climate resilience and transformative approach funded by the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-05: Improve design for transformative approaches and build local capacity for implementation of available solutions focused on climate adaptation. Synergies and cooperation could also be beneficial with the projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-02-1-two-stage: Innovating for climate-neutral rural communities by 2050.Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with the Mission Implementation and the Climate-ADAPT[5] platforms.Projects funded under this topic will get direct access and are expected to contribute into the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

About MIP4Adapt (europa.eu)[5]The European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT is a partnership between the DG Climate Action and the European Environment Agency.https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/","In February 2021, the European Commission adopted an EU strategy on adaptation to climate change that sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate resilient by 2050.Pushing further on the belief that we must adjust now to tomorrow's climate, the EU has launched a specific mission to foster the resilience of all, be it regions, cities, local communities, to climate change. Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.",,,,

The action shall strengthen the engagement of social innovation actors including philanthropy in the missions. Successful social innovation projects with a real potential for scaling to advance the EU Missions will benefit from structured and networked funding environment. Scope:Leveraging social innovation yields solutions that prove more adapted to society, locally and regionally, as well as more robust. In short, social innovations are 'innovations that are social in ends and means.” They materialize as new products, services, and models that simultaneously meet social needs more effectively than alternatives and create new social relationships or collaborations. Social innovation involves not only citizens, but also public authorities, business and industry, and academia in the design, development, and execution of innovations. Social innovation is not only good for society, but also enhances society's capacity to act. Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, results in a greater sense of agency and greater buy-in by citizens, industrialists, and public authorities, democratic participation, enhances the resilience of communities, increases the relevance, acceptance, and uptake of innovation, and helps foster lasting changes in individual behaviours, social practices, as well as governance models. In short, social innovation acts as a system changer.As such, social innovation processes are relevant to all EU Missions. The Commission expects social innovation to mobilise additional stakeholders and stakeholder communities such as philanthropic funders at European level for the benefit of the EU Missions.The availability of philanthropic and other funding for social innovation is highly skewed within EU Member States and Countries associated to Horizon Europe[1] and philanthropic and charitable funders face particular challenges to invest 'cross-border'. The EU wants to contribute to establishing a better funding environment for social innovation in the context of missions across the EU and associated countries by enhancing the networking and experience sharing of funders (notably by the action described in topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CROSS-01-01) and aims at collaborating to that end with interested funders by establishing long-term partnerships (framework partnership agreement / FPA).Article 130(2) of EU Financial regulation provides: 'The purpose of a financial framework partnership agreement shall be to facilitate the achievement of policy objectives of the Union by stabilising the contractual terms of the cooperation. The financial framework partnership agreement shall specify the forms of financial cooperation and shall include an obligation to set out, in the specific agreements signed under the financial framework partnership agreement, arrangements for monitoring the achievement of specific objectives.”Framework partnership agreements (FPAs) are implemented through Specific Grant Agreements (SGAs). Based upon an FPA, a procedure to award a SGA (included in this work programme part as ""Specific Grant Agreements for a European Networked Catalyst Fund for Social Innovation in Support of the Missions"") provides an EU grant in line with the presented action plan to realise the joint objectives. This EU grant of EUR 2 million shall top-up the own means at least EUR 4 million of the individual or group of funders. The FPA award procedure as presented here has no budget. The budget and rules on funding are set out in each SGA and depend on the specific type of action.The Commission plans to establish 5 FPAs to ensure widest possible geographic coverage and make social innovation funding more prominent and more accessible across the EU and associated countries.The expected duration of the FPA is of four years. Having concluded an FPA does not entitle entities to be awarded an SGA.The call targets funders of social innovation. Funders of social innovation may include foundations, philanthropists, national research and innovation funding agencies, other public bodies, or private investors.To apply for the action, interested individual eligible entities or groups thereof should demonstrate that they have a track record as social innovation investors/financiers or that they have funded social innovation projects. Applicants do not need to be involved in the CSA HORIZON-MISS-2024-CROSS-01-01.To apply for the action interested individual eligible entities or groups thereof shall describe the unique contribution the partnership would make towards (1) the outcomes specified in this topic, and (2) the wider impacts, in the longer term, specified in the respective destinations in the work programme and submit an action plan serving the above-mentioned objectives - namely advancing the EU Missions by financing the scaling up social innovation projects and increasing the impact of Horizon Europe funding by attracting additional non-EU funds in the form of private and public contributions - for the use of the grant that the Commission could award them via an SGA. The action plan should include the following: prospect identification and selection, and investment decisions: how they plan to identify promising projects and select the ones that they invest in; the Commission invites applicants to refer to the Mission Implementation Plans when developing prospect identification and selection, and investment decision criteria;funding strategies and practices including selection and award procedures in place or to be put in place to award grants to final beneficiaries that scale-up social innovations: how they plan to finance social innovation. The funding strategy presented shall be based on an exemplary EU grant of up to EUR 2 million complementary to own and other funds (see below) primarily to be granted to third parties over a period of up to 4 years (the maximum duration of the FPA). The amount here describes shall serve only as justification of the strategy, it does not constitute a formal financial proposal.financial architecture: how they plan to finance the upscaling of social innovations including the leverage that they can secure with the grant awarded by Horizon Europe through the SGA; the Commission expects applicants to match each EUR 1 granted by the EU with EUR 2 by non-EU sources as a minimum.monitoring and reporting: how they plan to monitor and report on the upscaling of social innovation projects;measuring and communicating impact: how they plan to measure and communicate on the impact achieved. The Commission invites applicants to consult the Horizon 2020 European Social Catalyst Fund pilot. Entities that are awarded an FPA could foresee collaborating with the networking, capacity building, and learning structure established by the HORIZON-MISS-2024-CROSS-01-01 CSA: 'A European Social Innovation Networking and Capacity Building Action for a European Social Innovation Networked Fund.”Blending Horizon Europe and non-EU resources would constitute a meaningful innovation in terms of EU co-investment schemes for social and environmental good.

Scope:The EU Missions on cancer, climate adaptation, climate neutral cities, oceans and soil pursue objectives agreed between Member States and the European Commission in the context of the European Green Deal and health policies. Sustainably managing common-pool resources and the provision of public goods (here taken together 'the Commons') are an important dimension in the EU Missions. Unlike technology development or scientific progress, for societal transitions and missions that relate to environmental and social Commons, scholars consider small-scale multistakeholder activities within a local or regional innovation ecosystem to be crucial for the non-technological innovation processes[2].Such innovation ecosystems for transformative change include non-commercial stakeholders like civil society and administrations.Such intensive transdisciplinary interactions are required, for example, for effective spatial planning and community action for increasing resilience to climate change, or for better services of prevention, early detection and care for cancer in vulnerable groups of society. To be effective such transdisciplinary research and innovation actions need a strong scientific lead in its design and operations in order to draw scientifically sound conclusions. The experience gathered and conclusions drawn must be taken up locally to create impact, for example in training courses, in by-laws for land management or in targeted support to entrepreneurship. The topic acknowledges the potential of local and regional collaborative, transdisciplinary action in research and innovation for the EU Missions and the value of sharing of data, innovative approaches, and experience in designing and managing local transdisciplinary research and innovation actions with other regions engaging in the Missions.Higher education institutions, universities and research institutes are key players for these actions. They already provide diverse services to stakeholders in their local region, including: lifelong learning courses and applied research that take account of the specific needs and opportunities of businesses and industries; research activities in the social sciences and humanities investigate cultural preferences; start-up ecosystems build around them, complemented by citizens' science; and science outreach activities engage citizens of all ages. At the same time, students and researchers participate in international networks and transfer knowledge to and from the region.For these reasons, universities, other higher education institutions and research institutes receive recognition and trust from public administration and public services, civil society, education, the private sector and other diverse stakeholders in their home region for their role as impartial, competent and knowledge-based actors for the co-creation of fair and inclusive innovation processes. This puts them in a good position to undertake collaborative, transdisciplinary research and innovation activities in their local context and enables them to play multiple, important roles in the realisation of the objectives of the Green Deal and the EU Missions.Proposals should therefore support transdisciplinary research and innovation activities by one or more higher education institution(s), university(-ies) or research institute(s) together with regional stakeholders in support of the objectives of one of the EU Missions.The proposal should aim to implement, for the benefit of a specific location or region in an EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe, a research and innovation action that: concretely contributes to the achievement of the objectives of one of the EU Missions, by creating new knowledge and/or developing and testing innovative approaches in co-creation with regional stakeholders, while not replicating the scientific/technological approach of projects already funded by Horizon Europe in support of the EU Missions Projects funded by Horizon Europe in support of the five EU Missions are documented either on the Missions' platforms and/or on Cordis (https://cordis.europa.eu), the platform for EU research results, using the search via 'Call ID” search string *MISS*. andengages in concrete transdisciplinary research and innovation activities and in strategy development to bring the Mission to the regional or local level stakeholders that traditionally have more difficulties accessing European level research and innovation support and/or the EU Missions (notably: small and medium sized enterprises; communal, municipal or other public services; citizens, civil society or philanthropy). The action provides the opportunity to integrate as partners in the project non-local entities that contribute to the project with special knowledge or capacities otherwise absent in the region. To increase the European added value, projects have to foresee activities active engagement in the learning environments created by the relevant Mission platforms[3]. This should be reflected in the projects' communication and dissemination activities and is considered an integral part of the expected impact of the project.Activities should aim to have tangible local or regional impact for one of the EU Missions, arising from the full integration of different academic disciplines in interaction with local stakeholders in the activities on the ground, for example in moderated or supervised experimentation and citizens' science activities in communities, in living labs or in regulatory testbeds.Insights created from these experimental activities should be taken up locally by stakeholders, for example in teaching and training activities, or in specific funding schemes for deployment and replication of innovations implemented by philanthropic funders, or commercial or development banks. Methods and results of the projects should be propagated in the wider Mission context to academic and non-academic stakeholders.Financial support to third parties may be provided, for example to cover the costs of experimental actions conducted by civil organisations or neighbourhoods, or for a local start-up support centre to provide seed funding for an innovative commercial activity that directly supports the objectives of the Mission. In order to achieve a close interaction of the regional and European dimension in the EU Missions, cooperation with relevant Horizon Europe National Contact Points is encouraged.

Scope:According to the IPCC, adaptation should be transformative, changing the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts. However, the portfolios of climate change adaptation policies remain embryonic and fragmented today: instruments focus mostly on building adaptive capacity through the creation of locally relevant databases and monitoring systems, awareness raising and capacity building actions, education and training[1]. For example, the increasing attention to 'just resilience' at strategic level is not matched with corresponding actions in the field and 'issues of equity and social justice are still rarely considered in local-level adaptation planning and actions”; 'many climate adaptation measures focus on technological interventions, without accounting for the social characteristics of cities, and thus fail to address the unequal burdens of climate impacts'.Local adaptation to climate change measures should never be taken in isolation. They are part of the socio-economic fabric of the region and its bio-geographic constraints (for example, its position in a certain river basin, along a certain coastline or in mountainous areas).This topic aims to better integrate the Mission on adaptation to climate change into the regional socio-economic policies and the just transition. This should be also coupled with raising the awareness of local authorities for co-creation opportunities between adaptation and other investments.Proposals should address all of the following aspects:Develop knowledge on how to integrate adaptation measures with regional transformative approaches such as the Smart Specialisation and regional innovation Agendas.Understand triggers for and barriers to behavioural changes from citizens and economic sectors in relation with just transformation and adaptation to climate change.Operationalise knowledge and understanding of the effects of local available adaptation projects on just transition goals on the macro-scale (such as for example in large river basin and regions across borders) and avoid maladaptation.Develop methods and tools promoting win-win solutions for adaptation and the socio-economic activities such as residential areas, tourism, transport, and energy, are made available to regional and local authorities.Operationalise knowledge to encourage co-creation of adaptation measures between different economic sectors and political objectives (taking down silos).Assess the impacts on climate justice, equity, jobs and climate resilience for specific themes and adaptation programmes.Assess the impacts on ecosystems and the cascading effects on neighbouring regions.The findings should be presented and tested in at least 3 regions/localities/communities with their neighbours, which include a mix of at least urban and industrial areas. The proposal should consider the opportunities offered by regions already engaged in the Mission (e.g., Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) as possible stakeholders.Develop a training module for the regions/localities/communities in the local languages on how to best include adaptation measures in their just transition policy. The training should be made accessible through the Mission Implementation platform. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.Proposals should connect to other relevant projects funded by Horizon- Europe, in particular on just climate resilience funded by the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-08: Demonstration of approaches by regions and local authorities focused on increasing climate resilience of the most vulnerable social groups (just climate resilience) Additionally, Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with Mission Implementation Platform and the Climate-ADAPT platform[2] as well as with other relevant initiatives such as the New European Bauhaus the Cohesion policy, and Regional smart specialisation strategies. [1]Harding & Nauwelaers (2023) Transformative Innovation for Climate Change Adaptation A mapping-based framework. under publication European Commission Joint Research Centre JRC134623[2]The European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT is a partnership between the DG Climate Action and the European Environment Agency.https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/","In February 2021, the European Commission adopted an EU strategy on adaptation to climate change that sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate resilient by 2050.Pushing further on the belief that we must adjust now to tomorrow's climate, the EU has launched a specific mission to foster the resilience of all, be it regions, cities, local communities, to climate change. Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.",,,,

Scope:This coordination and support action serves the EU Missions bysupporting the recognition of social innovation in the EU Missions;identifying social innovations with the potential to advance the EU Missions;identifying the social innovators and entrepreneurs to carry out the upscaling;setting up a network and build the capacity of social innovators and entrepreneurs, and impact investors to advance the EU Missions by scaling up social innovations;establishing a community of practice;providing an interface between the EU Missions and the network to match the demand for and supply of social innovation solutions as well as social innovation investment;enabling social innovators and social entrepreneurs to navigate the complex challenges of scaling up across complex public systems and markets better; expanding the range of financial instruments and sources of support so that the innovations continue to scale, after the support provided;establishing a framework for the implementation of a future research agenda to ensure that experience is gathered and learning, shared, building the profile of social innovation within and across the EU Mission fields;identifying the most favourable national legal entity to support social innovation projects on a case-by-case basis. Leveraging social innovation gives rise to solutions that prove more adapted to society, locally and regionally, as well as more robust. In a nutshell, social innovations are 'innovations that are social in ends and means.” They materialize as new products, services, and models that simultaneously meet social needs more effectively than alternatives and create new social relationships or collaborations. Social innovation involves not only citizens, but also public authorities, business and industry, as well as academia in the design, development, and execution of innovations. It connects society and innovation. Social innovation is not only good for society, but also enhances society's capacity to act. Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, results in a greater sense of agency, i.e. their ability to take action or to choose what action to take, and greater buy-in by citizens, industrialists, and public authorities, elicits active, democratic participation, enhances the resilience of communities, increases the relevance, acceptance, and uptake of innovation, and helps foster lasting changes in individual behaviours, social practices, and governance models. In short, social innovation acts as a system changer.As such, social innovation processes are relevant to all EU Missions mobilising additional stakeholders and stakeholder communities (like philanthropic funders and for- and with-impact investors) for the benefit of the Missions.Applicants are also encouraged to build on relevant ongoing activities undertaken by the EU Missions such as Mission Platforms.To help EU Missions achieve their objectives, the action should undertake the following activities: create and animate a network of entities interested in scaling up social innovations to advance the EU Missions as well as entities interested in investing in social innovation ventures, for the purpose of raising awareness and facilitating information exchange;create a favourable environment to upscale social innovation with the financial support of beneficiaries like entities interested in investing in such social innovation ventures;offer advisory services and mentoring for 'social innovators' wishing to expand the geographic scope of their activities within the EU and countries associated to Horizon Europe or interested in taking up social innovation from abroad. Advisory and mentoring may go as far assisting the preparation of upscaling plans and investment proposals, and matchmaking with social innovation funders. Applicants should propose convincing cooperation models with the relevant Commission services such as the EU Mission Secretariats to ensure that the project contributes to the objectives of the EU Missions. Applicants should ensure that they contribute comparable added-value to all EU Missions including through synergies between them. The project will have to document that it has done so.Actions should envisage, as appropriate, cooperation with other ongoing and future social innovation projects funded under Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe projects such as the ones related to the HORIZON-EIE-2022-CONNECT-01 Call entitled 'Integration of social innovation actors in innovation ecosystems. For, inter-alia, cross-project co-operation, consultations and knowledge exchange, joint activities on crosscutting issues as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events, especially where they relate to Missions.Applicants are encouraged to seek additional resources from public and private sources to ensure the continuation of the network beyond the project duration.The Commission invites applicants to consult the Horizon 2020 European Social Catalyst Fund pilot",,"This cross-cutting action advances the EU Mission objectives by setting up a European social innovation network. It leverages three different instruments: A Coordination and Support Action (CSA) will set up a network to build the capacity of social innovators and entrepreneurs, and impact investors;A Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) action will set up a framework to increase the impact of EU funding by attracting additional, non-EU funds in the form of private and public contributions and scale up social innovation projects thanks to a networked fund holding EU and non-EU contributions;One or several Specific Grant Agreements (SGAs) will implement the above budget-less FPA action. Notably:concerning the CSA and the FPA, applicants are free to apply to the CSA, the FPA, or both. The reason for this freedom resides with entities not needing to be part of the consortium managing the CSA to be part of the network that the CSA will set up;concerning the SGAs, applicants will have to have applied for the FPA and been selected to be eligible for an SGA. Expected impacts:Proposals for topics should set out a credible approach to creating a social innovation network and more specifically to the following impacts:the integration of social innovation in the EU Missions;the identification of existing, demonstrably successful social innovations, as established by qualitative and quantitative data, that enjoy a real potential for scaling, as attested by credible scaling plans, in support of the EU Missions;a network composed of entities interested in scaling up social innovation projects as well as entities interested in investing in such social innovation ventures;an interface between the EU Missions and the network to match the demand for and supply of social innovation solutions as well as social innovation investment;the foundation for a financial Framework Partnership Agreement to create a networked catalytic fund to scale up social innovations;a stronger social innovation funding environment;the engagement of social innovation actors including philanthropy;the identification of social innovation projects relevant to the EU Missions. Note: 'social innovation” refers to 'existing, demonstrably successful social innovations, as established by qualitative and quantitative data, that enjoy a real potential for scaling, as attested by credible scaling plans” in the remainder of the document, specifically, in the descriptions of the CSA, the FPA, and the SGA that follow.

Scope:Although the NEB has been championing bio-based materials for the built environment, more research is needed on products that make use of secondary bio-based construction materials, such as from by-products or waste from other industries or processes, including bio-based composites and residues/by-products from agriculture or from fishing, aquaculture and agro-food industries, in line with the cascading principles[1]. Using such products in the construction sector will reduce reliance on primary resources, hence minimising the environmental impact associated with their extraction and processing.Proposals should increase the potential of innovative bio-based products making use of materials from secondary sources for construction applications, thereby enhancing the circular bio-based economy in the construction sector, in line with the NEB values and the cascading principles. Project results will allow to inform the construction sector's supply chain, including architects, developers and other construction sector stakeholders, about the availability, potential, and added-value of bio-based materials from secondary sources for new construction and renovation projects.Proposals are expected to, for each secondary bio-based product covered:Assess its properties, benefits, design and construction possibilities and aesthetic[2]. This should cover at least the structural, thermal, acoustic, health-related and durability properties as well as the life cycle performance and environmental impact. This should also include the potential for deconstruction, re-use and recycling when buildings/public spaces undergo changes;Validate it in a relevant environment;Identify the sectors and applications where the chosen secondary bio-based material(s) could be embedded in construction processes and practices;Evaluate its economic scalability, including pathways for setting up efficient circular value chain to collect the secondary source.Contribute to the development of relevant European standards. Cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration is encouraged between profiles such as architects, artists, designers, engineers, biologists, urban planners, environmentalists, social scientists, and by extension the broader cultural and creative sector.Actions are strongly recommended to collaborate with and build on the work of relevant research, including national or European funded research[3]. Actions are also encouraged to take into account and contribute with their results to future work in the field of regenerative design applied to architecture.Projects shall share their intermediate and final results and findings with the 'New European Bauhaus hub for results and impacts' that will be established[4]. It will also cooperate, interact and take part in its activities when relevant to support the achievement of its objectives.

It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[ https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(https://craft-cities.eu/)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[COM(2020) 662 final]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent”, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see 'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe']]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.Innovative funding and financing models are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions. These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.R&I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission.

It should build on a centralised e.g. zonal or domain-based layout using distributed high-performance computing for connecting sensing and actuation systems with software updates over the air, big data flows and AI at the edge, resulting in a novel and upgradable electronic in-vehicle control scheme for safe and efficient automated driving functions and tele-operations.Important building blocks for the in-vehicle control architecture include sensors and sensor data fusion for environment perception with AI 'at the edge”, using on-board high-performance computers and generic hard- and software including cyber secure components.At the same time, the new control architecture and its context aware building blocks are expected to enable the following:reliable, low-latency and high-bandwidth data communication for automated driving systems control to safeguard against cyber-attacks, malfunctions and malicious interactions.systemic functionality gains in upgradability, efficiency, modularity, compatibility, scalability, fail-operation, reliability and redundancy.definition of safety and security targets, open-source standard layouts and harmonised validation methods.easier development and integration of connected and automated driving functions.

Scope:The aim is to advance on the orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic by building on, linking and integrating the following streams of research results and innovation challenges[2]: Smart routing and interactive traffic management using connectivity and C-ITS for the orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic within the CCAM ecosystem[3].Solutions for ensuring the safety and efficiency of early CCAM deployment in the interaction of drivers, riders, passengers, traffic participants and automated systems performing driving tasks in mixed traffic[4].Coherent approach towards managing fleets from an overall system perspective in real-life urban demonstrations of CCAM via testing and demonstrations in large sets of traffic environments with an emphasis on different fleets, i.e. groups of vehicles (including e.g. public transport/commercial/logistics fleets, fleets operated by public or private transport operators) that are typically controlled/supervised/managed by heterogeneous actors[5].New governance and operational models facilitating the orchestration schemes of traffic management that are inclusive towards all heterogeneous actors in traffic management[6]. Proposed actions will develop and demonstrate an orchestration scheme for traffic management energy according to priorities set by traffic authorities (including targets) that will facilitate the coexistence of heterogeneous actors or fleets on the road network (individual vehicles, public transport, Vulnerable Road Users) as well as, at different levels of vehicle automation (including human driven vehicles) in mixed traffic. Actions should contribute to the transformation of traffic management from managing traffic volumes to the management of vehicles (or even travellers) taking benefit from the advantages of fleet management (groups of vehicles that share the same attributes). Vehicles should be considered in their different sizes and usages, as well as by the mobility service they provide (private, public, shared, pooled etc.). Proposed actions should address both the transport of people and goods within automated fleets (commercial/logistics fleets, fleets operated by public or private transport operators) and individual vehicles (CCAM- or conventional vehicles, including micro-mobility) that are well integrated in the entire traffic management system. Proposed actions are expected to develop and demonstrate orchestration schemes for operations in mixed traffic by addressing all of the following aspects: Defining the comprehensive requirements (including data exchange) for the orchestration schemes with regards to the heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic (automated and non-automated traffic, people and goods and different modes).Developing traffic management tools that are essential for the coordination of mixed automated and non-automated mobility. These management tools should be robust and able to address uncertainty due to uncertain technological developments, performances, services and business cases that go beyond what is available through current research results. Tools should support orchestration by, among others, integration of ad-hoc and manoeuvre coordination (SAE cooperation classes[7]), efficient route guidance and capacity aware demand management.Defining and demonstrating business and governance models (including for public actors) for the orchestration of traffic management in real-time CCAM traffic conditions in urban and motorway environment, allowing actors to address their needs on a win-win basis.Developing measures and KPIs to demonstrate the benefits and added value of orchestration for traffic management actions (in terms of traffic efficiency, energy efficiency, safety etc.).Demonstrating a process that ensures trust in the traffic orchestration scheme proposed as well as sufficient accessibility to quality data for all traffic actors involved and readiness for large-scale demonstration actions.

[1] The term 'heterogeneous actors' comprises the heterogeneity of Road actors such as fleet managers, service providers, traffic managers, individual vehicles, Public Transport operators and users, Road operators and contractors and VRUs. Their actions differ due to their position in the ecosystem, their objectives and behaviour, which have an impact on traffic flow and other actors in the road network). The term 'mixed traffic' refers to different levels of vehicle automation (including human driven vehicles) present in the road network. Orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic takes place when the managing authorities take the needs and plans of all relevant actors into account when planning and directing traffic flows in the system also balancing the priorities set by the public.[2] CCAM Partnership, Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda 2021-2027, December 2021, Lessons Learned from completed projects, Horizon Europe Work Programme 2021-2022, Climate, Energy and Mobility, European Commission Decision C(2021)4200 of 15 June 2021, SOCRATES 2.0: Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) 2016-EU-TM-0148-S 2017, TM 2.0 Innovation Platform on interactive traffic management.[3] Building on the results of SOCRATES 2.0 pilots reflecting the TM 2.0 concept on smart routing and interactive traffic management.[4] Expanding on the results of Horizon 2020 projects (such as CoExist, TransAID, INFRAMIX, MAVEN).

Interactions with AI-based vehicles are understandable, human-like and reflect human psychological capabilities. Scope:Today's mobility landscape is rapidly changing, as is seen in the recent boom in the detection of advanced and/or complex urban scenarios that add new challenges to the development of CCAM technologies. These novel scenarios are especially emerging with the establishment of new urban traffic regimes and cultures, such as restricted zones, shared zones, and cycle-streets, which need to be taken into account when designing and developing CCAM solutions.To integrate and tackle complex traffic scenarios, CCAM technologies will require highly advanced decision-making based on enhanced collective awareness - the stage beyond on-board perception, advancing on e.g. results from projects under CL5-2022-D6-01-05[1] - incorporating information from multiple sources and including interpretation for the aggregation of this information. Developing collective awareness should take into account the state of the vehicle, the driver and the road user environment. It can also involve the tracking of other road users' behaviour and generating predictions on a short horizon, which can be based on the input from advanced behavioural models, e.g. those developed within CL5-2022-D6-01-03[2] projects. The integration of these findings will lead to collective awareness for CCAM.The use of multiple sources (sensors and sensor fused information, maps, infrastructure, other road users, and localisation systems) and the sharing of the overall situational information and related intentions of the vehicle and that of its direct environment will be an important building block towards collective awareness. Eventually, in future work this can be incorporated in complex, self-organised bottom-up models of collective behaviour based on the change/modelling of individual interactions. Collective awareness should create a larger time window in safety critical situations and generate benefits for the overarching mobility system, which include efficient traffic management and improved traffic flow as it incorporates situation prediction capabilities and environmental benefits (which can eventually include e.g. smart charging strategies).AI is a key enabler to bring these increasing amounts of information together, with decision-making enabled both at vehicle level (including safety critical decisions) and at a mobility system level. In order to continue to define the role and limits of AI and of emerging new developments within AI, this topic recommends exploring Hybrid Intelligence (HI) as such a new subset of AI. Hybrid Intelligence is the process of developing and mobilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) to expand on human intelligence and expertise, thereby ensuring human-like control of CCAM operations. Applying an HI approach will allow CCAM technologies to integrate human expertise and intentionality into its decision-making in order to generate meaningful and appropriate actions that are aligned with ethical, legal and societal values. This will be essential to foster user acceptability, trust and adoption, especially when appropriate SSH expertise is included.Proposed R&I actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Methods to establish collective awareness of CCAM applications that are resilient to faulty sources, thereby ensuring safe operations. Guidance for failsafe designs should be developed.Methods to embed an HI approach in the entire action chain towards collective awareness (from basic perception to driving functions) to allow for seamless operation and real-time decision-making while enabling human-like control of CCAM applications by combining system and domain knowledge (of the vehicle and its technologies on one hand and of the transport environment including all the human interactions on the other, thereby understanding of potential risks and capabilities and needs of other road users). Tooling will be required to deliver situational awareness information in a structured way, based on multiple sources and in real-time. In addition, the development and integration of ethical goal functions to support collective awareness should be included. Work is expected to be based on: At least perception systems, sensor fusion, high-level world models/maps, vehicle positioning information. Guidance on common reference systems for positioning and time for synchronisation should be included in order to secure robustness and traceability.Relationships between the vehicle and forecasted intentions of other road users (e.g. a pedestrian crossing the street at a zebra crossing), as such including spatial temporal relation of elements in the driving-situation. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.Proposals should monitor and align relevant developments under this topic with on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on 'Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility' (CCAM).

Scope:A common basis for CCAM Knowledge in Europe is available today with the online CCAM Knowledge Base[2] which constitutes a one stop shop for all relevant R&I initiatives, tools, methodologies, regulations and standards in the field. Targeted content will be available for some stakeholder categories. The Knowledge Base should be expanded and further adapted to the needs of all relevant stakeholders. Results and lessons learned from the EU, national and international projects should be made available and accessible to targeted user groups. Proposed actions should in particular provide support for stakeholders to move into operations by identifying key building blocks and standards for deploying pilot services and enable capacity building for key actors of different use cases /applications domains as well as for citizens and non-experts on how to use CCAM systems and services and to become aware of new developments and related risks.The EU Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) developed in project 'FAME” funded under CL5-2021-D6-01-06[3] aims at becoming the basic methodology for all CCAM related evaluations to support collaboration, exchange and harmonisation. The methodology will need to be implemented for existing and innovative use cases by CCAM projects and aligned with national mobility strategies and approaches. Training programmes for CCAM projects will be necessary to integrate the methodology and to collect feedback on lessons learned during its implementation.A States Representatives Group (SRG)[4] has been created within the CCAM Partnership to ensure a continuous dialogue at European and national level for the sharing of information on CCAM R&I to increase coordination between European and national R&I funding schemes, and among national programmes. To carry out its mission efficiently, the SRG will need support to collect and analyse information on national R&I initiatives and to implement cooperation activities.To successfully contribute to the expected outcomes, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: Ensure the maintenance and expansion of the Knowledge Base to support the CCAM stakeholder community and CCAM Partnership for the identification of future needs for R&I, testing and demonstration initiatives and for moving into operations (minimum block requirements, standards and common definitions to run pilot services across Europe). The content of the Knowledge Base should support the monitoring of the progress made on the targets and impacts set by the CCAM Partnership[5]. More specifically, the proposed action should regularly collect from the CCAM Partnership projects the data and information needed to track the KPIs set out in the CCAM SRIA[6], using a survey developed and maintained in agreement with the Partnership.Identify further needs for targeted content for specific stakeholder categories and in particular, develop content that is accessible to non-experts, thereby supporting capacity building of the general public. The proposed action should define the above-mentioned stakeholder categories, and develop a subsequent communication strategy (content, material, media, etc.) using realistic and accessible terms to address different target groups (including non-experts).Provide effective dissemination and concertation mechanisms and means for the stakeholder community (e.g., workshops, symposia, international cooperation, capacity building content for non-experts) and organise the EUCAD2027 event (as a conference with a side exhibition and demonstration site) together with the European Commission and the CCAM Partnership, to enable the exchange of experiences and practices, stimulate collaboration and cooperation between all CCAM stakeholders (including at international level) and reach consensus on challenges and future R&I needs within the thematic clusters of the Partnership.Facilitate the work of the CCAM SRG and stimulate the cooperation between EU Member States/Associated Countries for improved coordination of activities in the areas identified as priorities by the SRG. Provide an analysis of initiatives in EU Member States/Associated countries and support the SRG in identifying areas for R&I cooperation.Ensure representation of European stakeholders in international cooperation, information exchange and harmonisation initiatives on CCAM. Provide a global output on CCAM activities to support the development of European agendas by exploring potential opportunities and R&I domains for international cooperation.Continue to evaluate and update the EU-CEM through targeted discussions with EU Member States/Associated countries in order to align the CEM with national mobility strategies and regulations, also looking at both national and regional transport and mobility data to ensure compatibility.Support the practical implementation of the EU-CEM (for existing and innovative use-cases) and provide training programmes for CCAM projects to integrate the methodology.Assess the level of awareness and attitudes of European citizens, decision- and policy makers about CCAM as well as their intention to use through regular surveys and workshops. Results should be published in the Knowledge Base and mechanisms should be provided to integrate findings into the EU-CEM. A link should be established with existing survey initiatives in place at EU and Member States'/Associated countries' levels. This action should be grounded in a co-creative process. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on 'Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility' (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership 'Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility' (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.

Scope:Building on previously funded projects and ongoing activities (e.g. Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects), ensuring compliance with the data sharing framework pursued by the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), and taking into account the development of the common European mobility data space, proposals will pilot, demonstrate and scale up systemic collaborative solutions regarding logistics nodes, multimodal logistics networks connectivity, business and governance models. The focus will be on both digital and physical interoperability as well as on the adoption of zero-emission vehicles/vessels.Proposals will have to research and demonstrate in a structured and systemic way all of the following points:Demonstrate at least 10 working open standard processes, procedures and services across several logistics nodes providing seamless access to users. Processes, procedures, and services are expected to have an open access definition and scalability aspects need to be addressed.Develop and demonstrate further compatibility and interoperability of the full range of standardised multimodal transport units (from containers to boxes), also across transport modes.To achieve scalable multimodal logistics networks connectivity, demonstrate models and processes, supported by Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, etc., which can increase utilisation of assets and resources in actual logistics service providers' networks dynamically. These models should also consider how to increase the adoption of automated and zero-emission vehicles/vessels and the use of rail and inland waterways through multimodal solutions.Demonstrate tools, technologies and processes to achieve different types of flows compatibility (e.g. through shared standard boxes) and synchro-modal solutions over the logistics service providers' networks, involving shippers and retailers to that purpose.Demonstrate the benefit (e.g. GHG reductions vs increased operational costs) of decentralised inventory positions in the pooled logistics network allowing low speed multimodal transport for (re-)positioning stock levels and answering short term lead times with closer to consumer inventory positions (e.g. full visibility of inventory positions in retail networks extended to suppliers and logistics service providers).Test and demonstrate sound business and governance models and rules (including organisational change requirements) for resource-sharing across logistics networks, to ensure operational efficiency of freight movements irrespective of mode, nodal operations and freight characteristics.Test and demonstrate the functionalities and relevance of the data sharing framework, serving for optimisation of the logistic system, including through the establishment of an appropriate semantic model and its components, such as for instance Digital Twins with specific algorithms allowing for predictive planning of logistic related events. Synergies for rail will need to be sought with the EU-Rail Programme projects implementing the Transversal Topic on Digital enablers and Flagship Area 5[3].Develop and demonstrate scalability of the proposed solutions providing open access mechanisms and low thresholds to the system of logistics networks. Consider realising visualisation and simulation models and tools to show the practical use of collaborative models for the various types of stakeholders and the potential benefits based on actual cases. Develop specific actions to encourage, facilitate and ensure the access of SMEs and smaller players.Measure and demonstrate the benefits in terms of use of resources, affordability of proposed solutions, throughput capacity and environmental impact of the scaled up horizontal collaboration among logistics networks (system of logistics networks).

Scope:Increasingly, modern waterborne transport relies upon smart digital and connected systems to ensure safe and efficient operation. Within large complex vessels, system of systems approaches are used together with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence approaches to integrate diverse systems ranging from sensors, business and cargo management systems, power and engine management, electronic navigation and situational awareness. System integration of systems with proprietary digital control systems has become more and more critical in terms of ensuring safety and efficiency. The complexity and foundation upon software, makes assurance of the resilience of such systems challenging and requires a different to that applied to hardware- based systems. Waterborne digital system can be vulnerable to both malicious intervention and the consequences of system failure. Examples have included the spoofing of navigational GPS signals, ransom wear attacks on integrated container management systems, complete power shutdown and the helicopter evacuation of a large passenger ship when engine protection systems identified a common fault across all engine waterborne systems. The challenge to assure the safety and resilience of digital systems is particularly important within large complex vessels where the level of integration and connectivity is high and where the consequences of failure can be particularly severe.In the domain of power generation and management the vastness of new technological solutions, often driven by environmental regulations, poses new challenges in ships' design and management, where the need for integration of diverse energy converters (ICEs, batteries, fuel cells, wind, capacitors, etc.) confront designers and operators with systems based on profoundly different operating principles coming together with different requirements and control and digital systems. Integration for harnessing the full potential in a safe and secure frame is key to their implementation.Furthermore, the capability of integrating different systems (and their dynamics) involve an always increased number of sensors, whose data, fused, should become available for optimisation and increased awareness during normal and safe critical operations.Comprehensive HAZOP (Hazard Operability) studies are essential for such vessels, yet the methodologies are poorly established within the waterborne sector whilst other sectors operating safety critical digital systems (aerospace, nuclear, medical automotive etc.) have well established practices. Furthermore, applying 'hardware in the loop” to simulation and validation of digital systems in dependent on the quality of the digital simulation model. This can be difficult for waterborne transport due to the variability of ship designs, complexity and lack of relevant data concerning the integrated components. Pre-delivery testing and sea trials could include fault simulation and digital testing founded upon the identification of critical digital systems identified by the HAZOP, yet such trials focus on hard-ware or subsystems such as rudder control rather than addressing the entire integration. For safety critical systems, reliability regimes need to be established to identify the safe default state in case of system failure or the identification of malicious intervention. In this respect the best system state could be: 'fail operational”, 'fail soft”, 'fail safe”, 'fail secure”, 'fail passive”, 'be fault tolerant”.Activities will address the development of a HAZOP methodology for whole system assessment of highly digitised, connected complex vessels. The methodology should include system, system of systems designed for specific function or sets of functions and/or a methodology for the entire vessel, including when application of artificial intelligence algorithms is foreseen. The methodology will be developed with relevant stakeholders including shipbuilders, system designers and equipment providers, IT professionals, operators, class societies, regulators. The acceptability of the methodology to all stakeholders will be assessed and an implementation roadmap will be developed to account for any identified barriers. Work will draw upon the expertise of other sectors with more developed procedures for the assessment and assurance of digital safety.On-board systems and functions integration by design, for safe and secure operation should be used to test and demonstrate the safety and security of the applications.The developed methodology will be applied to a representative complex highly digitised vessel, safety critical systems and functions will be identified, and appropriate reliability regimes and mitigation measures will be established with consideration of both malicious intervention and system failure.Cost effective methodologies for validating the safety, resilience and correct functioning of digital and connected safety critical ship systems, including system of systems, will be developed and demonstrated.In case of validation on the basis of a theoretical digital models and/or digital twinning (e.g. hardware in the loop) then the validity of the model should be proven as well as its flexibility to be applied towards a range of vessel designs.In case of validation on the basis of physical testing of the responses of the final system to a range of fault conditions and malicious interventions during the final trials, there should be assurance that test conditions are representative of the identified risks. Guidance should be produced and disseminated concerning the recommended methodology for assuring the safety and resilience of complex digitalised and connected shipping.The safety assessment should be developed by using methodologies suitable for being assessed in international fora such as the International Maritime Organisation.

The proposed solution should address climate risk identified as relevant at regional and local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account place-based data, socio-economic, identity characteristics, local governance and the regional sustainable and smart specialization strategies when available.In its approach, the proposed solution should go 'far beyond addressing a specific sector', taking into account and addressing wide-ranging impacts. It should take a systemic approach, looking at the interconnections and interdependencies between them. For example, proposals could explore solutions addressing the interlinkages between climate, water, food, soil, biodiversity loss and others, which form a nexus where resource use and availability rely heavily on one another. Considering the current increasing trend of water scarcity (periods of drought followed by storms and floods, with a decreasing overall annual precipitations) tackling the pollution problem linked to these extreme climate events would be relevant. Another example of systemic approach can relate to the integration of multilevel planning, which integrates spatial and urban planning with the design of different services such as transport, mobility, energy, connectivity in a city. Interesting examples in this sense may come for instance from the New European Bauhaus initiative, which intends to accelerate the green transition by combining sustainability with inclusion and aesthetics/quality of experience.Interconnections and interdependencies need to be well understood and are further complicated as amplitude of climate change in the future is uncertain. In the medium and long term, for example, we know that climate change will affect water availability and crop yields with wide-ranging implications and that certain adaptation options (such as broader use of desalination for provision of drinking water to cope with water scarcity) can be energy intensive which compounds the problem of global warming, have local impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems, have side-effects that impact the environment (as is the case of brine from desalination, or water abstractions to produce hydrogen). Furthermore, it is not known to which level those adaption options could be implemented locally based on the relevance of the expected impacts or would be bashed away.Proposals should look to how tackle and possibly minimise trade-offs, maximise co-benefits and leverage opportunities a systemic approach offers to address the challenges of a changing climate in the specific local context. In doing this, they should produce state-of-the-art- analysis in a multidisciplinary approach addressing the science-policy nexus; they should go beyond theoretical research and/or theoretical discussions or the pure understanding and quantifying of the links between the different elements and sectors. On the contrary, proposals should turn them into operational and practical insights and tangible solutions experimented on the regional and local grounds, clearly addressing trade-offs and co-benefits, with a view of achieving optimum outcomes. Proposals should also consider how to turn the proposed solutions into new standards so to allow faster uptake at scale.In addition, proposals should mobilise and include all value chain actors and pay careful attention to matching innovators and solutions providers with end-users/regions interested in testing and further developing the proposed solutions on the ground; they should also foster the development of business models that can support the sustainability of the proposed solutions.Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating” regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating” regions. Replicating regions are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare in the course of the project the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds or the Just Transition Fund.Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with Mission Implementation Platform[1] and Climate-ADAPT[2] (. Proposals should also explore synergies with the projects funded under the topic 'HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-04: Research the complex interplay between the climate and biodiversity crises towards more systemic approaches and solutions” of this call.Projects funded under this topic will get direct access to participate in the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 to 7 by the end of the project - see General Annex B. [1]Currently managed by MIP4Adapt under the contract CINEA/2022/OP/0013/SI2.884597 funded by the European Union. About MIP4Adapt (europa.eu)[2]The European Climate Adaptation Platform Climate-ADAPT is a partnership between the DG Climate Action and the European Environment Agency.https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/","In February 2021, the European Commission adopted an EU strategy on adaptation to climate change that sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate resilient by 2050.Pushing further on the belief that we must adjust now to tomorrow's climate, the EU has launched a specific mission to foster the resilience of all, be it regions, cities, local communities, to climate change. Rooted in research and innovation, the Mission aims to align towards its concrete objectives all relevant actors and stakeholders to deliver tangible solutions and concrete impacts[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf]].The Commission Communication on Missions COM(2023) 457 adopted on 19 July 2023, confirmed the strategic importance of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, to enable Europe to prepare for unavoidable climate impacts and accelerate the transformation to a climate-resilient Europe. It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.A regional approachThe Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting impact and to accelerate their transformation to become climate resilient. By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.The R&I support will be provided in different ways:1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.",,,,

Activities will also support the proposed Carbon Removal Certification (CRC) Framework (including through collaboration with the Commission's Expert Group on Carbon Removals) [1], the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation [2], the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Action Plan on the development of Organic Production, and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 on Climate action.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:The confidence of stakeholders (including land managers) in participating in possible carbon farming certification schemes and the attractiveness of the carbon farming [3] business model are enhanced through better access to information and data regarding soil carbon (achievable sequestration and storage, risks of release, etc.). This should allow to improve soil management performance and mitigate the negative climate impact of activities in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Reliable benchmarks or baselines for soil carbon at land management parcel level across the EU are established, with a view to providing financial rewards to those farmers and forest managers/owners who go beyond the baselines within the proposed framework for Carbon Removal Certification.Improved decision making in the LULUCF sector at the regional or national level thanks to enhanced quality of national GHG inventories and geographically explicit soil monitoring elements that reflect action at the individual level.Market situation and social dimension are better integrated into EU carbon farming policy, in particular as regards the impact of carbon farming incentives on rural development, farmers' and foresters' incomes, competitiveness, food security and land access. Business strategies and (digital) marketplaces for carbon farming, including a registry for carbon farming credits/certificates, support EU carbon farming policy.Regulated EU carbon credits and environmental and financial incentives, within legal frameworks and for certified measures for carbon farming deployment strategies, specifically for foresters and agricultural land managers or owners, are supported. This should be aligned with the EU CRC Framework aiming at promoting carbon removal activities and fight greenwashing by encouraging forestry and agricultural sectors to act in this field and effectively demonstrate that carbon farming can be quantified through appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) methods. Scope:With the European Commission's proposal for a first EU-wide voluntary framework to reliably certify high-quality carbon removals (Carbon Removal Certification -CRC- Framework) [4], the EU aims to boost sustainable carbon farming solutions by significantly improving Europe's capacity to quantify, monitor and verify carbon removals. Higher transparency will ensure trust from stakeholders and prevent greenwashing. The development of soil carbon removal deployment strategies and a robust and validated soil carbon monitoring system approach, at scale relevant for land managers, are therefore crucial. This system approach is currently underdeveloped and solid and reliable data for establishment of baselines for soil carbon at parcel level across Europe are missing. The system approach should further the potential for financial rewards to farmers and forest managers/owners who excel in their carbon farming practices, in line with the CRC Framework proposal. It should also lead to enhanced quality of national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories for the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, as well as be relevant for the establishment of the database for the proposed EU Soil Monitoring Law. To show the extent to which a carbon farming activity results in a positive climate impact, the European Commission will establish standardised baselines reflecting the standard performance of comparable activities in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances and geographical locations. This type of baselines ensures objectivity and transparency, minimises compliance costs and other administrative costs, and positively recognises the action of first movers who have already engaged in carbon farming activities. However, the geographically-explicit data needed to identify and set such standardised baselines and help prioritise regions and actions for carbon farming is currently missing.Moreover, it is important that the EU boosts sustainable carbon farming solutions by enabling a business model that financially rewards land managers for such activities, as stressed by the EU CRC Framework and the Commission's 2021 Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles. The EU CRC Framework aims to ensure that financial incentives from both private and public sources are channelled towards high-quality carbon removals and nature-based solutions. However, to ensure its correct functioning, interoperable public registries and MRV protocols compliant with standards and technical rules to be set out at EU level are needed. These will ensure transparency, full traceability of carbon farming certificates, an easily accessible marketplace for these certificates, and avoid fraud risk and double counting.Proposed activities should:Develop, validate and apply pilot, innovative, robust, local soil carbon monitoring systems in line with the CRC Framework proposal, able to gather the data needed for the European Commission to set out standardised baselines reflecting the standard performance of comparable activities in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances and geographical locations in Europe. These systems should also allow to evaluate achievable biophysical potential of carbon storage and related co-benefits of carbon farming activities, at land management parcel-scale [5] and for the whole European territory, and help prioritise regions and actions for carbon farming.Investigate and develop approaches and methodologies for soil [6] sampling pertinent to the granular level of the monitoring, including assessment and exploitation of the technological innovation opportunities and the potential to reduce monitoring costs.Leverage the power of existing remote sensing tools such as those typically employed in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) control, i.e., in conjunction with spatially explicit parcel data (e.g., Land Parcel Identification System - Geospatial Application (LPIS-GSA)); and develop a structured, standardized system for understanding and managing the direct effect of carbon farming practices on soil carbon (including the practices promoted by the CAP).Demonstrate and where possible expand the power of digital tools and technologies (including electronic databases and geographic information systems/geographically-explicit digital map data, remote sensing, artificial intelligence and machine learning) for (decreasing the costs of) the data collection, for establishing baselines and for the monitoring of carbon removal activities.Deliver guidance (e.g. manuals) for policymakers and certification bodies on soil monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), data collection protocols, and baselines against which action is quantified. Such guidance should be designed within the upcoming EU CRC Framework and in consultation with the Commission's Expert Group on Carbon Removals.Develop and test harmonisation protocols within a distributed data management system for the integration and direct comparison of upcoming CRC data and existing spatially explicit information contained in national LULUCF inventories and other soil organic carbon datasets (such as LUCAS, and pertinent national datasets).Develop a framework to collect and analyse data coming from certificates (both within existing voluntary carbon markets and the upcoming CRC Framework), to define reliable ranges of carbon sequestration and outliers, and consolidate interoperable, quality-checked datasets.Use results of the above work to calibrate and validate modelling frameworks applicable to the monitoring methodologies mentioned above in this topic.Create metrics to gauge carbon sensitivity to perturbations, particularly those linked with climate change, by analysing different soil carbon fractions.Evaluate the permanency-related risks of release of carbon, using modelling scenarios.Address key uncertainties and scientific knowledge gaps that currently exist within carbon removal quantification methods, helping to develop a standardised MRV approach.Undertake an in-depth assessment of the market situation for carbon farming, building on existing and ongoing research, to assess the (expected) overall market impacts of carbon farming, including the potential income opportunities for farmers and other land managers, impacts on land productivity and land prices, and sensitivities over the 'commodification” of carbon removals and ecosystem services, for different carbon farming activities (e.g. agroforestry, rewetting of land and other practices).Analyse the different channels and business strategies for the marketing of certified carbon removals, providing an overview of the current market and outlook for the next 10 years. This analysis should consider differences between marketing certified carbon removals within and outside the agri-food or forestry value chains and identify the relevant market players in each case.Create a network among existing carbon farming schemes across several European countries and scale up their activities by developing an interoperable digital marketplace, based on a geographically-explicit registry, that provides easier access to the carbon farming units certified by those different schemes. This registry should follow the rules set out in the CRC Framework and be consistent with Member States' reporting in the LULUCF sector so as to enable Member States to improve their GHG inventory data. The registry should enable monetary transactions involving carbon credits, however the project(s) should not directly carry out such transactions. The 'carbon farming' activities to be covered are those defined in the CRC Framework proposal. Whenever relevant, the synergies and trade-offs between carbon and nitrogen and their possible optimisation should be covered. All types of land, including forests and their above-ground biomass, where relevant, should be covered. In the case of the agricultural sector, organic farming, as an approach with potential to increase carbon sequestration in the soil, should be included.Key information/data on soil carbon should be shared with land managers, to enable them to learn from peers and facilitate access to tailored advice and certification services to improve their soil management performance and verify the mitigation impact of their activities in view of possible certification. Given the necessity for new ideas that meet social needs, create social relationships and form new collaborations within this topic's subject, proposals should integrate social innovation.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with other relevant forthcoming projects as well as to capitalise on activities and results from on-going, relevant projects. In particular, projects should build on the preparatory work done by projects funded by the EJP SOIL programme (e.g. CarboSeq project), AI4SoilHealth, BENCHMARKS, MaRVIC, MRV4SOC, CREDIBLE, HoliSoils, CLIMB-FOREST, INFORMA, OptFor-EU, the ORCaSa project, InBestSoil, NOVASOIL, SoilValues, and the project originating from the HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-09 topic (on carbon farming in living labs), as well as work carried out by the Joint Research Centre on the establishment of baselines for the implementation of the CRC Framework.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs, and between existing databases and models, through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), the upcoming EU Forest Observatory and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO. [1]Commission proposes certification of carbon removals (europa.eu)[2]https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02018R0841-20230511[3]I.e. including enhanced carbon sequestration in forests, etc. See also definition at the bottom of the topic[4]COM(2022) 672 of 30 November 2022, COM_COM(2022)0672_EN.pdf (europa.eu)[5]Paying attention also to those land-uses changes that may impact carbon dynamics in soils, such as the construction of renewable energy plants in soils with high carbon stock[6]Including possibly porewater, whenever relevant","Life on earth depends on healthy soils. Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

Scope:Peatlands can provide multiple ecosystem services such as timber production, climate regulation, water quality control, flood abatement, biodiversity conservation, as well as recreational benefits. However, this potential is compromised due to drainage. Alternative soil management practices for forest peat soils, in particular through the combination of rewetting techniques and forest management (with the exclusion of afforestation), have the potential to improve the environmental, climate and economic performance of peatlands, as well as reduce the impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment and dissolved organic carbon exports. In particular, practices are needed that effectively address trade-offs from forests multifunctionality and apply an integrated approach to their management (considering biodiversity, climate change challenges, bio-economy needs etc.). This topic does not cover agricultural emissions.Proposed activities should:Establish demonstration(s) of sustainable, climate-positive and biodiversity-relevant forest management on peat soils, including rewetting;Assess the benefits of the practices regarding carbon sequestration, while taking into consideration any impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment and dissolved organic carbon exports from forest peat soils, thus providing information and indicators (such as baseline, quantification method, MRV) of the practices to maximise climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity and other benefits.Improve monitoring techniques, including remote-sensing and field-data methods integrating technologies such as AI and robotics, and develop large-scale, minimally invasive GHG measurement facilities on re-wetted sites, to better assess biodiversity and climate aspects of forest management.Consider and assess the potential of demonstrated activities to be replicated and scaled up, particularly with a view to developing financial incentives under the EU certification framework, and to this end develop approaches and recommendations for policymakers and land managers. The project(s) must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain and all relevant actors (landowners, foresters, scientists, advisors, local/regional/national public authorities, industry, etc.) throughout the different stages of project development and implementation.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to build on and collaborate with ongoing Horizon projects, notably MRV4SOC, MaRVIC, ALFAwetlands, WET HORIZONS, RESTORE4Cs and REWET and with projects to be supported through topics 'HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-8: Conservation and protection of carbon-rich and biodiversity-rich forest ecosystems”, 'HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-2: Socio-economic, climate and environmental aspects of paludiculture"", and ""HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-3: Paludiculture: large-scale demonstration'.Where relevant, proposals should also build links with projects funded under the Mission 'Adaptation to Climate Change”. Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this and future calls of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs, and between existing databases and models, through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO), the upcoming EU Forest Observatory and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO [1]https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02018R0841-20230511[2]Commission proposes certification of carbon removals (europa.eu)","Life on earth depends on healthy soils. Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

Scope:Achieving climate neutrality by 2050 is a central goal of the European Green Deal. However, soil-derived gaseous nitrogen emissions from agriculture are often overlooked due to challenges in monitoring. A comprehensive assessment of both gaseous and non-gaseous nitrogen losses, including their geographical distribution and varying temporal resolution, is essential to inform effective greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies and encourage the adoption of higher Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tiers at the national level.Nitrogen losses are highly episodic, and the current temporal and spatial resolution of information regarding nitrogen dynamics across Europe is insufficient for a comprehensive estimation of the full nitrogen budget at a continental scale. The most commonly used methodology for measuring N-flux involves discontinuous flux measurements accompanied by standard gap-filling methods, which lead to large uncertainties and biased emission factors. Additionally, most existing observations focus on temperate zones and single flux exit pathways, neglecting the full spectrum of nitrogen forms, including both gaseous and non-gaseous forms across different climatic conditions. Data and observations are particularly lacking in the Mediterranean basin and some nitrogen transformation pathways are not well investigated. For example, widely used modelling approaches estimate the reduction of N2O to N2 by applying a conversion factor developed in laboratory conditions that do not comprehensively represent the vast array of soil types found in Europe. These ratios are subject to bias associated with the use of linear rates for nonlinear dynamics. To address these gaps, accurate information must be acquired, which will facilitate the development of effective management strategies that effectively minimise total nitrogen losses from soil. Additionally, this information will improve the parameterization and validation of models and increase the confidence of model predictions when scaled to the continental level. This will ultimately lead to a more refined and accurate estimation of nitrogen surplus, enrich existing dashboard estimates, and further support the evaluation of the effectiveness of management strategies, and guide future research and policy decisions related to mitigation efforts.Proposed activities should:Develop and employ advanced nitrogen monitoring and analytical techniques to generate high temporal resolution data on nitrogen fluxes and their drivers in various climatic conditions with particular focus on underrepresented pedo-climatic conditions.Implement a coordinated, holistic approach to develop and evaluate robust, practical management strategies that effectively minimise total nitrogen losses from soils while addressing potential trade-offs with other environmental concerns, such as water quality and soil carbon preservation.Utilise advanced modelling approaches to analyse the collected data, identify patterns and relationships between soil biogeochemical processes and nitrogen fluxes, and improve predictive tools that can be used to inform management strategies on a regional to continental scale.Implement and monitor pilot projects that test the effectiveness of the developed management strategies in diverse pedo-climatic zones, accounting for local environmental conditions, agricultural practices both in conventional and organic farming systems, and socio-economic factors that may influence adoption and outcomes.Synthesise the findings from field studies, modelling efforts, and pilot projects into a comprehensive estimation of the full nitrogen budget at the European continental scale contributing to the EU Soil Observatory through the provision of high-quality datasets for monitoring, reporting and verification.Development of scenarios on how climate change and land use change will affect nitrogen cycling through the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project Soil-WISE. In particular, to ensure inter-operability between existing databases and models and their integration in the EUSO.Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to build on the work of other projects working on quantification of nitrogen fluxes in Europe that are being funded by other entities, including philanthropic organisations, particularly where there is geographical or thematic complementarity.In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.","Life on earth depends on healthy soils.

Scope:Below ground biodiversity plays a major role in soil structure, nutrient supply, water cycling, nutrient uptake by plants, and in the biocontrol of plant pests and diseases. The interactions between communities of soil organisms, crops and their environment (holobiont) profoundly influence crop, soil and agroecosystem health and productivity. Notably, the interplay between soil fauna, soil microbial community, soil chemistry, and plant immune responses can be enhanced to harness the potential of soil ecosystem to defend against pathogens, pests and other detrimental organisms and to promote plant health and productivity. By managing soil ecosystems to enhance soil health through farming practices (e.g., crop rotation, use of microbiome solutions, etc.), it is possible to support plant defences, suppress diseases, improve nutrient availability and enhance plant resilience to various stressors. In addition, agricultural sustainability will be increased and contribute to climate change mitigation.There is a need to develop, test and deploy management practices that, by enhancing soil health, will facilitate, for instance, the management of soil-borne plant pests and diseases (e.g., bacteria, fungi, nematodes, root-feeding insects), and support ground nesting pollinators.Proposed activities should:Develop and test site-specific innovations including management practices, solutions and tools that promote soil biodiversity, enhance soil health, stimulate plant growth, reduce chemical inputs to control soil borne plant diseases and root-feeding insects, and support ground nesting pollinators.Set up demonstration sites to test the proposed innovations and promote the benefits of soil biodiversity and healthy soils not only for growers and the agroecosystem but for the entire food value chain.Assess the social, economic and environmental issues associated with the proposed innovative solution, including trade-offs, the impact on labour, safety culture, and risk management on farms;Generate comprehensive capacity building material, organize trainings or knowledge sharing activities, including the development of guidelines to accelerate the dissemination, uptake and upscale of results.Enhance peer-to-peer learning with relevant stakeholders from farmers and advisors to policy makers and consumers, supporting a coordinated scientific and policy approach towards healthy soils. Proposals should focus on arable crops. Work under this topic should be carried out in various pedo-climatic zones [2] and benefit both the conventional and the organic farming as reflected in the expertise of the consortia.

They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

This means that large areas of important habitats offshore remain unprotected (such as soft sediment bottoms or habitats of highly mobile species such as marine mammals), which hinders the achievement of EU and global marine conservation targets to achieve a coherent MPA network. One of the main challenges for the establishment of offshore MPAs is the lack of knowledge about the distribution and condition of marine habitats, as well as pressures affecting them, due to high cost and effort needed for their surveillance and research. This has also been raised by Member States as one of the main issues with the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and of the future Nature Restoration Law. Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will contribute to achieving the Mission objective 1 - Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity.  Proposals are expected to contribute to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, including the Marine Action Plan, the Birds, Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework directives and the future Nature Restoration Law as well as relevant international agreements (e.g.: the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction - BBNJ).    The proposed activities should cover all following objectives:  - mapping the distribution and condition of marine (benthic and pelagic) habitats in offshore[1] areas (beyond 12 nautical miles from the coast); - providing the scientific basis for establishing new marine protected areas (or enlarging existing ones) in offshore areas, including strictly protected ones; - assessing pressures (including cumulative ones) in offshore areas and establishing the necessary conservation measures for MPAs, including through elaboration of their management plans and monitoring schemes. Projects are encouraged to actively involve Member States/Associated Countries' authorities and concerned stakeholders.Proposals should be site-specific, and the number of sites, their size, objectives and management measures of the protected area(s) for demonstration activities have to be ecologically relevant and impactful and contribute to enhance ecosystem services.Projects should build and capitalise on the knowledge base developed and lessons learnt from other projects, initiatives and programmes linked to the field of biodiversity, marine environment and conservation, as well as on the work carried out in relation to Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems, as required under the REGULATION (EU) 2016/2336 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2016 establishing specific conditions for fishing for deep-sea stocks in the north-east Atlantic and provisions for fishing in international waters of the north-east Atlantic and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002.Projects funded under this topic are expected to  show a significant replication potential by identifying areas and locations where the proposed measures could be replicable. An action plan and roadmap needed for the replication and scale up of the proposed measures for offshore marine protected areas are expected to be drawn up by the end of the project, taking into account Marine Spatial Planning plans. For improved coordination and networking, the applicants should set aside resources for activities to engage with other relevant actions funded under Horizon Europe, in particular projects funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 6 topics, Mission Ocean and Waters topics, EMFAF/EMFF and LIFE activities.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments.

Support progress in restoring our ocean and waters, in adapting to climate change, reversing biodiversity loss and pollution, by co-designing inspiring narratives that stimulate effective action by policy-makers, citizens and stakeholders, and by identifying the pathways that are necessary to realise them. Increased awareness of decision-makers, stakeholders and citizens, including students, through structured science-policy interfaces, in relation to the urgency of the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises and the central role of restoring the entire water system to address these crises. National, regional and local decision-makers in planning decisions are taking measures to protect and restore their ocean, coastal and water spaces and ecosystems. Scope:This action will develop and co-design transitional alternative futures of the EU, in which the Ocean, seas and waters are conserved or restored to good health. The action will support the co-creation of narratives, and innovative visualisation tools such as maps, related to different scenarios of what the EU and its ocean, seas and water spaces could look like by 2030 and 2050 if innovative solutions to restore our ocean and waters would be applied, so that the targets of the Mission Ocean and Waters and consequently those of the European Green Deal are fully reached. These narratives must be supported by the co-design of different science-based transition pathways together with citizens including students and key stakeholders such as scientists, experts and decision-makers responsible for planning ocean and water spaces. The co-design process should be inclusive, participatory following transdisciplinary and structured science-policy-society interface methodologies and taking into consideration environmental, social, economic and political considerations.Following on from a pan-European vision, proposals should also develop specific regional visions, scenarios and narratives for each of the four Mission lighthouse areas in the Atlantic-Arctic, Danube, Mediterranean Sea, Baltic and North Sea, supported by innovative visualisation tools and co-created by multi-actors such as local stakeholders and citizens. By choosing a minimum of four large scale case-studies, the action should enable the participatory co-design of alternative futures where the Mission objectives have been achieved in the lighthouse area, and develop together with the relevant stakeholders the action pathways and necessary narratives to achieve these alternative futures.Proposals should develop and visualise different scenarios for each of the case-studies, with both 2030- and 2050-time horizons in line with the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and EU Green Deal targets. They should at least encompass a business-as-usual scenario, in which current trends are extrapolated, as well as a scenario where European Green Deal and relevant environmental legislation (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive[1], Birds[2] and Habitats[3] Directives, Water Framework Directive[4]) targets for climate, biodiversity and pollution are fully reached through the large-scale deployment of innovative solutions. The change scenario(s) should build on deliverables of relevant Mission related projects[5], best practices on citizen participation and deliberative democracy, national initiatives as well as state-of-the-art models and draw on data and projections from the IPCC, IPBES, European Environment Agency and JRC. Finally, they should rely on and be compatible with the EU Digital Twin Ocean developments and eventually become one of its use-cases.Scenarios of the future should in particular include the deployment at scale of innovative solutions with a special emphasis on nature-based solutions[6], which are proven to be environmentally, economically and socially effective and which address in particular the climate change, biodiversity and pollution driven challenges to the ocean and water system[7], including biodiversity loss and its impacts on marine ecosystems and sectors relying on it, sea level rise, extreme weather, as well as pollution of the seas, coasts and rivers. The scenarios should take the objectives of current EU policies and legislation into consideration for their design.Proposals are expected to develop a map and visualisations as an interactive, dynamic and digital tool and application to be co-created and used by citizens, including schools and planners at EU, national, regional and where applicable local level, using whenever possible the Digital Twin of the Ocean core public infrastructure and its services. This could take the form of an interactive 2D and 3D visual experience of the future envisioned EU and regional landscapes (NUTS 2 and NUTS 3) and ocean and water space incl. the seabed.Proposals are expected to work closely with other Horizon Europe projects, particularly Prep4Blue, the 4 Mission lighthouse CSA projects (EcoDaLLi[8], BlueMissionAA[9], BlueMissionMed[10], BlueMissionBANOS[11]) and other relevant projects, as well as the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Support Platform to connect to citizens and stakeholders in the region (incl. the lighthouse citizen assemblies), build on existing activities and strategies at basin-level and to take into account innovative solutions that have already been developed and deployed.This topic should take into consideration contributions of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.Proposals may draw on experiences of past projects such as 'A nature-based vision for The Netherlands in 2120'.

The proposals should help to ensure that the Coalition has a balanced representation of diverse communities across Member States and Associated Countries, including participation of smaller cities and municipalities.The proposals should help the Coalition to forge links and coordinate with other important EU initiatives and key players (while at the same time avoiding overlaps), such as the EU Cities Mission, the Horizon Europe Partnership for a Sustainable Blue Economy, the European Environment Agency and organisations in charge of protection of the marine and coastal environment in Europe; as well as relevant international activities. The proposals may also collaborate with and build on the experience of other relevant existing networks, partnerships and initiatives[3] as well as take into account relevant strategic research and innovation agendas and regional strategies.The proposals should enable the Coalition to leverage funds for implementing the actions to achieve the Mission objectives, including through facilitated synergies and access to EU, national, regional and private funds and strategies, in interaction with managing authorities if applicable (e.g. ERDF, EMFAF, LIFE, Interreg, RRF, RIS3/RIS4 etc), the financial sector (e.g. EIB), investors and philanthropies.The proposals should also support the Commission in developing, launching and implementing a Mission Ocean and Waters Label, under guidance of and in a close collaboration with the EC Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[4]. The Label should be awarded to entities that have already adhered to the Charter or are planning to do so, and whose activities or transition plans are being assessed as stand-out in terms of excellence and impact towards reaching Mission objectives. The Label will recognise the commitment to achieving the Mission objectives and facilitate access to possible funding and investment. In particular, the proposals should work with the EC Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat to define detailed objectives and criteria for awarding the Label, taking into account and building on existing certification or label[5]￼; develop measurable certification standards in line with the Mission's targets and a transparent verification process, as well as help conduct a pilot exercise awarding the Label to the first group of actors that qualify for it. In order to accelerate and facilitate broad adoption of the Label, the proposals should develop a strategy for the promotion of the Label, including defining the benefits for the entities that would undergo the labelling, and choosing the most appropriate tools and methods for raising awareness of the Label, including the design of a compelling brand identity for the Label in line with the visual identity of the Mission and establishing partnerships with key stakeholders. The proposals should also foresee provision of guidance and support to the communities of actors wishing to apply for the Label. The labelled entities will also be integrated in the existing Mission community networks, and receive support from the Mission Implementation Platform and other initiatives and projects linked to the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters. The proposals should put in place a system to monitor and evaluate the labelled entities, as well as promote collaboration among them. The proposals should also establish necessary support structures to ensure longevity of the Label. The labelling process will be designed and implemented in close collaboration with the EC Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[4]The proposals should work closely with other Horizon Europe projects, particularly Prep4Blue, the 4 Mission lighthouse CSA projects (EcoDaLLi[7], BlueMissionAA[8], BlueMissionMed[9], BlueMissionBANOS[10]), the projects selected under HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-01 and the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Platform [11] in order to ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps. The project resulting from this topic will be implemented in close collaboration with the relevant EC service(s) and Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[4] to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission.Applicants should be flexible enough to accommodate for some adjustments that may be requested by the Commission before the grant agreement signature to ensure complementarity of activities between the projects CSA projects selected in past Mission calls (Prep4Blue, EcoDaLLi, BlueMissionAA, BlueMissionMed, BlueMissionBANOS), the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Platform, and the projects selected under topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-01.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU. Activities to further enhance the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and to further engage with citizens are also covered.",,,,

It supports the Soil Mission specific objectives, in particular the following ones: 3 'No net soil sealing and increase the reuse of urban soils”, 4 'Reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration”, 5 'Prevent erosion”, and specific objective 8 'Increase soil literacy in society across Member States”.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.Practice-oriented knowledge, tools and techniques are more easily available to urban communities, local city councils/regions and land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across across neighbourhood/communities, territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regards to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies. Scope:While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and green European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.Nowadays, there are various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users [1]. For the purpose of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', ¨soil health living labs are defined as 'user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption”.Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level [2]. Individual sites could be e.g., urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried-out and monitored under real-life conditions.Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as 'places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement”. They are individual, local sites (one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context, applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites.Urbanization is a challenge for soil health, due to construction and infrastructure development that entails, among other, land take, soil sealing, contamination or compaction. Against this background and by working together on common challenges, actors in living labs in urban areas will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, benefit from cross-fertilisation, and connect with their local/regional ecosystem. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.More specifically, each of the funded projects should:Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, if relevant) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s) faced by soils in urban areas (e.g., sealing, contamination, fertility, erosion, compaction, etc.) while increasing the overall resilience of urban areas. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission's specific objectives [3]. Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, land uses, Mission objectives addressed).Establish, based on the projects' goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s) identified, taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed strategies and solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Where relevant, regeneration of soil health or repurpose of soils on urban areas to provide locally sourced fresh and healthy food to local food services (e.g., canteens, restaurants, food trucks, markets, etc.) and citizens should be considered.Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the Soil Mission Implementation Plan and the descriptors of the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience.Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators. In particular, for living labs working on soil sealing, identify urban-specific monitoring methods in connection to the work developed by Copernicus and for the functional and ecological impacts of the soil sealing process.Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes. In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement a multi-actor approach. The list of stakeholders will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and should involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public authorities (e.g., administrators responsible for green spaces (such as parks, gardens and urban farms), urban planners, schools, and representatives of civil society (e.g., citizens, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, based on their areas of expertise. For example, while some partners may lead conceptual work and coordinate work within and across living labs, others may focus on conducting experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or participating in outreach activities. Where relevant, soil literacy activities for citizens including on agroecology and permaculture should be considered.To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe: This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties [4].Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of stakeholders can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.Applicants are reminded that they can benefit from the services of NATI00NS, the project dedicated to support potential applicants to the living labs topics.In order to increase impact and sustainability, applicants are encouraged to explore and test new (or in combination with existing) funding schemes and financial instruments, either public or private involving, where relevant, finance providers such as public authorities or financial institutions and investors.Projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of SOILL18, the dedicated 'Living Lab Support Structure' established to provide tailor-made advice to participants of living labs and lighthouses in their day-to-day operations, as well as enforce the monitoring of their activities in a systematic way, reporting on the main outcomes and experiences. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to collaborate with SOILL as well as with other projects relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s) and urban soils, funded either under the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' or under other parts and pillars of Horizon Europe or other EU programmes, as appropriate. For the latter these would include networking, attendance to meetings and organisation of joint activities (e.g., workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities). The details of the joint activities would be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and the life of the project.Collaboration and synergies with the Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities” is highly encouraged if living labs are established within one or more of the cities nominated as part of that EU Mission [5]. In addition, if relevant, projects should explore complementary synergies with ongoing Horizon Europe projects such as CLEVERFOOD that is developing a Food 2030 Connected Lab Network of living labs. Additionally, funded projects should collaborate with BENCHMARKS and AI4SoilHealth, which are key new projects looking at sampling, monitoring validating and further development of indicators and proxy measurements for soil health, as well as using AI technology to accelerate the collection and use of soil health information.The projects may also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs) or the upcoming European partnerships on Agroecology [6] and on Sustainable Food Systems [7].Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge/data and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.

Activities will also contribute to the EU Soil Strategy 2030, the Common Agricultural Policy and its Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF), the framework of indicators in the proposed Soil Monitoring Law, and the EU Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicator set for monitoring progress towards SDG 15 and SDG 2.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Enhanced knowledge on multi-process soil erosion dynamics (e.g., water, wind, tillage, etc.) across Europe based on a combination of novel computer-based estimates and monitoring activities for better estimation of policy impact.Further validation of soil loss by water and wind erosion indicators at continental scale with local/regional assessments which can be used for policy making and implementation (e.g., in the Common Agricultural Policy, the Soil Strategy for 2030 or the proposed directive of soil monitoring and resilience).Best management practices that significantly reduce erosion adjusted to different pedo-climatic conditions in Europe and various cropping systems are compiled and more widely known by relevant stakeholders including land managers such as farmers.A robust soil erosion monitoring network is established across EU and Associated Countries to further develop estimates and validate gross erosion rates at parcel level. Scope:Current EU/European estimates on soil loss by water and wind erosion are long-term averages performed with empirical models, which, in agricultural areas, are subject to huge uncertainties. Policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) would benefit from more up to-date and annual estimates. Improved estimates would contribute to developing a process-based model, which can incorporate management practices and their potential for reducing soil loss by water, and wind erosion in agricultural fields and facilitate the adoption of the best practices. Other processes such as tillage erosion or gullies can also be considered. Existing partially explicit parcel data (e.g., LPIS-GSA), data from the EU Land use and land cover survey (LUCAS) and the latest updates from the COPERNICUS platform could/should be used to improve current pan-European modelling frameworks.Proposed activities should:Create a network of stakeholders to monitor soil loss by water and wind erosion across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries in different crop conditions (including managed grasslands).Develop a monitoring scheme to implement, test and validate methods for assessing soil loss by soil erosion at European (continental) scale.Develop process-based models at continental scale, which consider soil erosion factors such as management practices applied by farmers, rainfall intensity, soil properties, topography and other biophysical attributes.Incorporate both field observations and latest state-of-the-art Copernicus products to better quantify and calibrate soil erosion factors.Quantify the impact of different management practices (e.g., cover crops, reduced tillage, plant residues, mulching, grass margins, crop rotation, terraces, etc.) on reducing soil erosion.Link those scientific outputs (e.g. improved soil erosion factors, impact of management practices) with the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) requirements of the CAP (e.g., impact of management practices such as cover crops or reduced tillage in CAP GAECs).Provide landowners and various stakeholders with best information on soil losses and with recommendations on the most suitable management practices to reduce soil loss. Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate and capitalise on activities and results from projects financed under other Work Programme topics of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', in particular AI4SoilHealth, Benchmarks and Soil O-Live.Cooperation with international networks in UNCCD, FAO Global Soil Partnership and the IPCC is encouraged to upscale the produced knowledge at global scale.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project SoilWISE. In particular, to ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be used and displayed in the EUSO.","Life on earth depends on healthy soils. Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.

Activities will also contribute to the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, to the revised EU Pollinators Initiative 'A new deal for pollinators”, to the future EU Nature Restoration Law and the proposed Soil Monitoring and Resilience Directive, to the EU Farm to Fork Strategy, including the EU Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production, and to the goals of the UN CBD COP-15. It also directly contributes to the achievement of several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in particular SDG 15 by halting biodiversity loss and halting and reversing land degradation and SDG2 on food security as activities are expected to improve pollination ecosystem services, which are key for food production.Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Improved knowledge and understanding of the biology and ecology of insect species spending part of their life cycle on or in the soil, with specific focus on ground-nesting pollinators.Better understanding of the major causes of the decline of these insects and the synergistic effects of various threats, including the quantitative and qualitative aspects related to the magnitude of their decline.More effective measures to tackle the loss of soil-dependent insects. Scope:Soil-dependent insects are under threat because of non-adapted soil management practices such as tillage and issues like contamination, compacting or sealing. A better understanding of the causes of their decline and effective measures to tackle them are needed.Pollination is a key ecosystem service for crops and food production. Therefore, a specific focus on pollinating insects is required. Many solitary wasps and 70% of wild bees nest below ground and require protection during this crucial period of their lifecycle. Other ground-nesting pollinators also contribute to soil quality and other ecosystem functions, but little is known about their below ground lives.The 'New Deal for Pollinators” calls for more research to better understand the taxonomic and functional diversity of pollinator communities and their distribution, as well as the threats to pollinators and their interactions.Proposed activities should:Improve the knowledge on the biology, ecology and population dynamics of insects spending part of their life cycle on or in the soil, with specific focus on ground-nesting pollinators, as well as on the interactions between life below and above ground. Focus should be put on lesser-known species, regions and major threats and causes of their decline. The potential buffer and protective role of soil against threats in different soil and land uses, including applied agricultural practices, such as ploughing (e.g., agricultural, forestry, urban and natural areas) should be explored.Contribute to the development of monitoring methods including on threats and pressures that can be of relevance for the pollinator monitoring framework, under the revised EU Pollinators Initiative : 'A New deal for Pollinators”.Identify soil conditions associated with a high diversity of pollinators and map regions of particular importance for the protection of soil-dependent pollinators.Analyse the effects of different soil management practices, including different plant protection and/or soil management methods, across different farming systems, such as organic farming or conventional approaches, and compare intensively managed areas with protected areas.Develop and demonstrate soil remediation and mitigation practices to address the causes of insect (and in particular pollinator) decline.Provide recommendations for best soil management practices to integrate pollinator conservation and restoration across the wider landscape and enhance habitat connectivity and pollination services. Projects should seek potential synergies and capitalise on the results of past or ongoing projects (e.g., Horizon projects Safeguard, PollinERA and WILDPOSH [1]). Furthermore, specific tasks and resources should be envisaged to collaborate and capitalise on activities and results from projects financed under other Work Programme topics of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', in particular BIOservicES and SOB4ES and under the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-SOIL-01-06: Harnessing the multifunctional potential of soil biodiversity for healthy cropping systems.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory and the SoilWISE project and the EU Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.International cooperation and links to global conservation actions are encouraged. Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this and future calls of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and should involve at least researchers, landowners and/or land managers, and representatives of civil society notably environmental NGOs.

Activities will also contribute to the EU-Africa Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture, African Union strategies, initiatives and action plans relevant for soil health and support global commitments and SDGs, in particular in the areas of sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition security, biodiversity, and climate.Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Enhanced and accessible data for policy makers and intergovernmental organisations to inform a continental 'convergence of evidence' map that indicates areas in Africa that are likely to be affected by soil degradation processes (as has been implemented for Europe with the EUSO Soil Health Dashboard).Enhanced access to knowledge that can be used by a wide range of stakeholders to inform soil and land management policies and practices, prioritize areas for intervention and research and development, and support improved advisory services for farmers in Africa.Improved datasets are available on soil threats/properties which will contribute to the development of an interactive Soil Health Dashboard for Africa. Scope:Africa has a large degree of degraded soils, suboptimal land use, population growth and increasingly urban population. These factors are contributing to increased competition and pressures on land (less land per farmer, less quality land per farmer, climate change, biodiversity loss) resulting in unfavourable economics of farming and ecosystem management.The IPBES report on land degradation and restoration [1] highlights huge economic cost of land and soil degradation, including increasing cost of no action. Soil health is key to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Therefore, holistic systems approaches are needed for addressing multiple context specific soil health related challenges at country and regional level. In addition, evidence driven analytical framework is urgently needed for adequate soil health priority setting and planning at regional and national level, alignment of partners and investments.Proposed activities should:Develop a scalable Africa-wide soil health dashboard, building on the experience of the EUSO Soil health dashboard, leveraging existing data (e.g., Africa Soil Information System AfSIS [2]) and other EU funded projects such as Soils 4 Africa.Strategic collection of new data to fill soil knowledge gaps (such as pollution, compaction, biodiversity, nutrient status, acidity/acidification, soil organic matter, soil erosion, soil water) and improve the accuracy and functionality of the dashboard through consultative engagement with national stakeholders.Identify critical local/regional thresholds for key soil health descriptors.Develop roadmaps to highlight trends in soil health responses to policy instruments.Support participating African countries in the development of national soil health strategies in at least 8 countries, to better manage soil resources for agriculture and the environment. In developing the strategies, projects should create use cases and provide training opportunities for the interpretation and use of data. Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and SoilWISE and ensure interoperability between the dashboard and other databases (such as national soil information services or the Horizon 2020 project Soils4Africa).Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to build on the work of Soils4Africa and other projects on soil information that are being funded by other entities (e.g., ICARDA), including philanthropic organisations, particularly where there is geographical or thematic complementarity. The Consortium is invited to propose a long-term sustainability plan for the dashboard in Africa.While having a focus on Africa, activities could tap into international expertise (particularly from Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) as deemed necessary.

It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

Scope:Addressing societal challenges such as climate change, energy poverty, the pandemic, ageing population or the increased societal divide will require to rethink the way we develop and live in our neighbourhoods. Current ways of planning, designing and building often overlook the importance of continuously engaging end-users or local communities. Yet, incorporating community knowledge and efforts can lead to more liveable neighbourhoods that reflect local needs and contexts and empower current and future residents. Moreover, the way public spaces are designed can have an important impact on the way people interact with each other, the kind of activities that take place in such spaces, and the trust of people towards their local authority and thus democracy. Therefore, it is key to empower people to take an active role in co-designing those spaces. This can lead to greater acceptance, enhanced sense of belonging, social trust and an increased willingness to further engage with the community, and thus promote a global positive social impact on people's well-being and the neighbourhood as a whole.Building on work carried out in previous projects, proposals will study, refine and validate existing engagement approaches, that allow residents, businesses, cultural organisations and local governments to co-design and co-create public spaces in neighbourhoods. For instance, this should include how to involve citizens in the development and maintenance of public spaces and neighbourhoods; or flexible designs allowing communities to re-create or re-furbish spaces according to evolving needs. Special attention should be paid to involve diverse groups and citizens at risk of exclusion.Proposals are expected to address all of the following:Study and refine engagement model(s) and methodology(ies) that enables the meaningful participation of concerned stakeholders and citizens in the co-design, refurbishment and development of public spaces in their neighbourhoods. The model and methodology should: Be inclusive and accessible, and ensure that citizens are empowered to contribute to the decision-making processes;Use innovative digital tools, platforms and technologies such as augmented reality or virtual reality, to facilitate virtual and physical collaboration between citizens, designers, urban planners, policymakers and the construction ecosystem to enhance citizen engagement in the planning, design and construction process while ensuring that digital solutions remain inclusive and accessible, and assessing their added value compared to 'traditional' in-person methods. Demonstrate that the chosen engagement approach(es) (e.g. model, methodology, digital tools) can effectively and measurably foster openness, social cohesion, trust and acceptance within communities as well as promote the inclusion of marginalised communities and/or vulnerable groups in public space redevelopment projects. Proposals should demonstrate this in at least three neighbourhoods with differing local environmental, social and economic conditions, and each one located in a different Member State or Associated Country.Monitor and evaluate all stages of the chosen engagement approach(es), using an appropriate methodology, and measure the success of projects in fostering openness, social cohesion, acceptance within communities as well as the inclusion of marginalised communities and vulnerable groups.Assess how the above may impact future project design and decision-making in the construction of neighbourhoods as well as in the construction ecosystem. Cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration between architects, engineers, designers, creative sectors, natural and social scientists, urban planners, environmentalists, and by extension the broader cultural and creative sector is encouraged. The involvement of relevant stakeholders such as local small organizations, communities' representatives, end-users, and local authorities in the design and implementation of the project is also encouraged.Actions are strongly recommended to collaborate with and build on the work of relevant research[1]. Actions are also encouraged to take into account and contribute with their results to future work on the impact of public spaces on social relations in neighbourhood communities.Projects shall share their intermediate and final results and findings with the 'New European Bauhaus hub for results and impacts' that will be established[2]. It will also cooperate, interact and take part in its activities when relevant to support the achievement of its objectives. Resources should be dedicated to engage with this Coordination and Support Action.

It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[ https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(https://craft-cities.eu/)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[COM(2020) 662 final]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent”, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see 'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe']]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.Innovative funding and financing models are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions. These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.R&I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Covenant of Mayors and past and ongoing relevant projects funded by Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, such as STARTS, as well as with other EU programmes such as LIFE-CET, LIFE-Circular Economy, URBACT, Green City Accord and European Green Capital/Leaf awards.",,,

Along the same lines, the Technical Measures Regulation includes the objective of contributing to ensure that incidental caches of sensitive marine species are minimised and where possible eliminated so that they do not represent a threat to the conservation status of these species and to provide protection for juvenile and spawning aggregations of fish species.In this context, the Marine Action Plan: 'Protecting and restoring marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient fisheries' stemming from the EU Biodiversity Strategy seeks to accelerate the transition to more sustainable professional and recreational fishing practices. It puts forward several actions to protect vulnerable and sensitive species and juvenile fish, notably through improving gear selectivity and practices to reduce their by-catch, using technological innovations and practices to prevent incidental catches and reducing the impact of fisheries on marine biodiversity and habitats, including sensitive marine ecosystems.This topic will support the Common Fisheries Policy, the Technical Measures Regulation, the EU Biodiversity Strategy, including the future Nature Restoration Law and the Marine Action Plan, the Habitats, Birds and MSFD directives as well as the EU sea basin strategies.Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will contribute to achieve the Mission objectives 'Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity' and 'Make the blue economy carbon- neutral and circular'. Projects should build and capitalise on the knowledge base developed and lessons learnt from other projects, initiatives and programmes linked to the field of biodiversity, marine environment and conservation, including projects and studies funded under Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe; EMFF, EMFAF and LIFE programmes, as well as relevant work done by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)[1], by the General Fisheries commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM)[2] and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)[3] as well as relevant work done at basin level[4], in the Member States and Associated Countries.In particular, the projects funded under this topic could benefit from cooperation and sharing of information and data through collaboration with Horizon Europe projects selected under the topic on 'Understanding and reducing bycatch of protected species' (HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-5).Proposals under this topic are expected to identify, test, validate and demonstrate in real conditions, a set of suitable innovative and economically viable solutions, technologies, practices and processes to minimise the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems, specifically aiming at protecting sensitive species and juvenile fish as identified in the Marine Action Plan[5] as well as respecting animal health and welfare.  Each proposal should address one sea basin (i.e.: 1. Atlantic and Arctic basin or 2. Mediterranean Sea basin or 3. Baltic and North Sea basin), where identified solutions will be demonstrated in several relevant fisheries. Proposals should take a holistic approach aiming at protecting marine biodiversity while also avoiding potential negative environmental impacts, including on the seabed.Proposals should also consider the energy efficiency and climate neutrality of the proposed solutions, thus contributing to the energy transition of the EU fisheries sector.Projects should actively involve end-users and fisheries communities in their activities. Activities should be tailored to address regional/sea basin specificities and when relevant, local/regional authorities should be engaged, e.g.: Fisheries Management authorities. Project activities should cover all following issues:demonstrating mitigation measures and sustainable fishing tools, e.g.: innovative gears and techniques improving selectivity and addressing incidental bycatch, such as exclusion devices, use of frangible gear, acoustic deterrent devices, escape panels, and other solutions;demonstrating mitigation measures and sustainable fishing operations, such as restricting fishing activities in targeted areas, temporal and/or spatial closures, safe handling of bycaught species and reducing mortality of discarded species, experimental restocking programmes and other solutions;carrying out specific activities to assess operational feasibility in commercial fishery situations and to support fishers in taking-up the solutions as well as to promote sea-food products from sustainable fisheries. In addition, projects are expected to show a significant replication potential by identifying a range of relevant stakeholders who could replicate the proposed solutions. Action plans and roadmaps needed for the replication and scale up of the solutions for sustainable fishing operation and tools should be drawn up by the end of the project.Proposals addressing the EU Outermost Regions[6] are encouraged, given these regions' natural assets.

The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU. Activities to further enhance the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and to further engage with citizens are also covered.",,,,

Among the various marine citizen science activities, very prominent are the ones that engage actors from different parts of society to contribute to the observation of the coastal zone and the ocean and produce relevant data, related to physical, chemical, geological properties of the marine environment, marine biodiversity and/or human impact (e.g.: marine litter). It is important to capitalise on this interest, both by sustaining and increasing the sense of community and motivation of these actors and by providing them with validated methodological protocols and processes, to ensure that the information and data they collect becomes available and useful for wider use.The objective of this topic is to establish a Marine Citizen Science data network, which will aim to bring together the very important, but scattered and un-coordinated actors of marine citizen science, active in data collection. Such a network will provide a sense of community to these different in nature parties, will increase visibility of marine citizen science data collection activities in Europe and will invest in coordinating these activities by providing a harmonisation framework, which will increase the added value coming from marine citizen science. Such an activity will ensure dual effects towards the Mission's Ocean cross-cutting enabling actions: it will support targeted engagement of different categories of social actors in the production of credible Marine Knowledge and it will thus directly support the development of the Digital Ocean and Water Knowledge System.Proposals are expected to address all following activities:Establishment of a Marine Citizen Science network The pan-European Marine Citizen Science data network is expected to bring together actors in marine citizen science data collection domains in the European Union and in neighbouring countries and to build a sense of community between these actors, engaging and coordinating different type of organisations. The core aim of the network will be to support its participants to contact the various marine citizen science data collection communities efficiently and in a manner that will increase the added value of their contribution towards Marine Knowledge. The network should aim to include actors from all different data fields on marine citizen science.A key activity for the establishment of the network consists in the identification, mapping and involvement of the different actors that provide observation and data input to marine citizen science, extending from volunteer or scientific groups (schools, NGOs or universities, tourists) to more structured community contributions that can come from professionals (for instance fishermen) or companies (sailing companies, port authorities, etc.) that are willing to contribute in these initiatives.The network should act as a multiplier of work contacted on marine citizen science data collection from different organisations around Europe and operate as a connection hub for their activities. Through the described actions the network will ensure the higher visibility of marine citizen science data collection activities in Europe and will contribute both to motivate the already engaged actors and to bring in the network more interested parties, by connecting them with the appropriate organisations, providing them with community advice on how to set up their own activities, in line with common standards and sharing the collective knowledge created through the network.The long-term sustainability of the proposed network should be considered.Citizen science activities: information and data collection To increase the added value of the marine citizen science activities, the proposals should ensure that information and data collected are widely usable and integrated in existing knowledge management platforms (e.g.: EMODnet, Blue Economy Observatory, etc.) and in the end be available for use in the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO).Specific activities are expected to adapt and make available data and metadata standards appropriate for use in marine citizen science, building on the work developed by SeaDataNet, EMODnet and other marine data infrastructures. These standards should be tailored to the needs of citizen science and ensure that the data collected can be harmonised and used in an effective manner.The proposals should also consider the development of easy-to-use tutorials and easy-to-understand training modules, targeted to different categories of marine citizens science actors collecting data. This material should focus on methodologies to ensure that the data collected is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), will explain how data is made available and will provide recommendations and guidelines for effective citizen science observing activities. The training materials should also ensure that citizen science activities do not conflict with nature protection objectives.Finally, the proposals are expected to address the development of good practices regarding data and information consumption coming from marine citizen science activities and make these good practices visible at local, national and European level, as well as at the international level, particularly through the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.Deployment of cost-efficient, citizen science appropriate observing equipment The proposals should ensure the link between marine citizen science actors and the developers of cost-efficient ocean observing sensors and to facilitate the procurement of appropriate and easy to use citizen science devices and equipment that will enhance and harmonise the outputs of marine citizen science in Europe.Proposals are expected to define and implement two use-cases to demonstrate in real conditions the use of affordable, durable, high-efficiency and low-carbon footprint marine observing devices/equipment, relevant and applicable to marine citizen science. Observing devices/sensors that are easy to use, automated, standardised and with direct uploading of date in verified databases should be prioritised.These use-cases will act as pilots, to show, on one side the benefits of using standardised, simple to deploy and use equipment for wide citizen science campaigns and on the other, the benefits and the economies of scale of large procurements of observing devices/equipment for citizen science.These use-cases should also provide insights for the mobilisation of public and private funding to maximise future deployment and use of observation devices/sensors, thus supporting the scaling up of marine citizen science activities in Europe.","The Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030' will provide a systemic approach for the restoration, protection and preservation of our ocean, seas and waters.

Scope:As stated in the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Plan, the deployment and upscaling phase (phase 2 of the Mission starting in 2026) aims to 'enable broad participation in the Mission across the EU” with 'a strong citizen, stakeholder and community governance element”. In the second phase of the Mission implementation, the solutions developed and piloted in the first phase (development and piloting phase) to deliver on the Mission and Green Deal objectives will be further deployed, replicated, and scaled up. Therefore, in the last years of phase 1, a transition to the deployment and upscaling phase needs to be well prepared.Reaching the ambitious Mission objectives and targets is dependent on mobilising a broad set of actors to take meaningful action to restore our ocean, seas and waters. Practical, easily accessible support is needed for established or emerging communities of actors to facilitate the deployment at scale of innovative actions, measures and initiatives contributing to the EU Mission's objectives, and the transformations required at national, regional, and local level.Each proposed action under this topic should address one of the four basins covered by the Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030'[3] and should foresee all of the following types of support to Mission communities of actors of the respective basin: financial support to third parties (also referred to as cascading grants) to community-led pilot actions; cascading grants for transition agendas; and technical assistance, to be provided by the consortium.Cascading grants to community-led pilot actionsEach proposal under this topic should foresee awarding at least 5 cascading grants of EUR 200 000 - EUR 2 million[4] per grant to community-led pilot actions that are implementing innovative solutions towards achieving one or several interlinked Mission objectives in the respective basin addressed by the proposal. The Commission estimates that the total budget for the cascading call to support community-led actions could be in the order of EUR 7 million. These third-party community-led actions may be implemented by a consortium of several participants. The size of the consortium and the budget requested should reflect the specific local needs addressed by the third-party action.The proposals must ensure that the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted is based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness, in accordance with Annex B of the general annexes to this work programme.The proposals are expected to provide a detailed plan for the cascading grant call for the community-led pilot actions, in particular planning the launch of the call no later than the end of month 3 of the project. The proposals should describe appropriate means to promote the cascading grant call at lighthouse, national and regional levels that would allow them to reach as many of the potential applicants as possible.The third-party actions supported through the cascading call should demonstrate measurable, verifiable, and ambitious progress towards reaching at least one or, whenever possible and applicable, several interlinked objectives and targets set out in the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Plan. The chosen focus of the third-party actions should depend on which objective(s) are most urgent for the communities dealing with specific conditions and realities in a particular area. However, addressing several objectives, in the case that this is feasible, may provide an added value and should thus be seen as advantage for the applications in the cascading calls.The third-party actions should focus on implementing innovative solutions that go beyond the state of the art and that combine, as appropriate, technological, nature-based, social, cultural, regulatory, and financial innovation, and new governance models. The actions should foster a participatory approach that empowers local stakeholders, builds on their local know-how and application of sustainable practices, and encourages their long-term commitment to the protection, restoration and de-pollution of our ocean, seas and waters and to making the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular. With the help from the project consortia selected under this topic, the community-led third-party actions should promote the deployment and upscaling of innovative solutions to restore the ocean and waters, including through the preparation of deployment plans.The community-led third-party actions should be encouraged to cooperate with scientific institutions to stimulate transdisciplinary innovation activities, which are based on best available science practices. Transdisciplinary activities denote cooperation of diverse societal stakeholder groups (administration, civil society, business & industry, finance, etc.), not only across academic disciplines ('interdisciplinary').These community-led actions should also consider an effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. Social innovation should also be considered in order to match innovative ideas with social needs.The proposals should encourage the third-party actions to build on research and innovation developed by projects financed under the current and/or previous EU framework programmes and other relevant EU and national programmes, linking also to the Mission Implementation Platform[5], and where applicable, make use of Copernicus/Galileo/EGNOS and Emodnet.Attracting additional financing from Structural Funds or any national, regional, local programmes or private funding at any stage of the community-led pilot actions is strongly encouraged.The types of Mission communities relevant to the cascading grants may include at least the following:ports (including inland ports);islands;fishing communities, aquaculture producers and other representatives of blue economy;operators of various vessels;Local Action Groups described by the Community-Led Local Development strategies[6]waterfront cities or regions / communities (avoiding overlaps with Cities' Mission);conservation communities;representatives of the tourism sector;maritime infrastructure operators (incl. offshore platforms and their operators). Various types of actors in the communities listed above could apply for the support. These could include for example:regional and local authorities;NGOs, foundations, professional associations, and other entities engaged in local development and nature conservation activities;educational establishments;locally based companies (provided this is not in conflict with the State Aid rules);research performing organisations, etc. Cascading grants for transition agendas Each proposed action should also foresee awarding at least 20 cascading grants for transition agendas of up to EUR 100 000 each, addressing the types of Mission communities described above. The proposed actions should ensure that the selection process of the third parties to which financial support for transition agendas would be granted is based on principles of transparency, objectivity, and fairness, in accordance with Annex B of the general annexes to this work programme.A transition agenda for this call is understood as a strategic roadmap towards reaching all objectives and targets of the Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030' in the applicant communities, with a particular focus on the objectives that are most relevant to the specific community. The roadmaps could cover processes needed to ensure the protection and restoration of marine/coastal/inland waters, biodiversity and ecosystems, the reduction/elimination of pollution and the achievement of decarbonisation and circularity targets, as well as include a plan for a defined number of years concerning the objectives set, covering, for example, expected outcomes, results, impact, ways to achieve them and ways to bring in financing to support the achievement of these objectives.The transition agenda should indicate how specific results and ideally also their impacts are expected to materialise in order to ensure the actual achievements of the objectives. These agendas would serve as a basis for further planning of follow-up activities by the actors involved, particularly actions to meet the Mission Ocean and Waters objectives/targets, to be subsequently implemented with the financial support of various funds (e.g., EU structural funds/national/regional funds).All entities establishing transition agendas should commit to report to the project that had issued the third-party financing within 6 months after finalisation of the agendas on the progress of implementing its results in practice.Technical assistance to Mission Communities of actorsThe proposals should also foresee technical assistance to Mission Communities of actors in the basin addressed by the respective action. Such assistance should address the needs of the Mission communities of actors in the particular basin and may include support and advice needed for the preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, impact assessments, and needs assessment, as well as long-term sustainability planning to help the communities of actors develop sustainable financing strategies to ensure longevity of the efforts to achieve healthy oceans, seas and waters; capacity building to empower communities of actors with the knowledge and skills needed to undertake effective pollution prevention and elimination, conservation and restoration initiatives, as well as making the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular; and other Mission-related actions that would require direct counselling, written guidance, online materials, webinars, in-depths sessions, deep dives, peer-to-peer support, twinning etc.).It is essential to tailor the support provided to the specific needs and context of each community of actors, including through the use of local languages, as well as fostering a participatory approach that empowers local stakeholders and encourages their long-term commitment to the protection and restoration of our ocean, seas and waters.The proposals under this topic should also work on clustering of and support to the third-party community-led actions. The proposals should help create a network of these community-led actions to enhance communication, collaboration and sharing of knowledge and best practices to maximise their combined impact, and create links to the networks similarly created by the other three projects selected under this topic in other Mission lighthouse areas.Furthermore, the proposals should assist each community-led action in using its experiences and solutions to establish new networks and collaborations in their respective areas. The proposals should provide guidance and support to the third-party actions in forming partnerships with local communities, NGOs, government agencies, or relevant stakeholders to expand the impact of the actions and create a collaborative ecosystem for knowledge sharing, resource optimisation, and wider adoption of successful solutions.The proposals should provide help and guidance to the selected community-led actions regarding access to additional funding. The proposals should also identify, evaluate, and showcase feasible and scalable solutions demonstrated by the community-led actions, and provide guidance on deployment of these solutions.Furthermore, the proposals should set aside funds for clustering and collaboration among four projects selected under this topic, including for a joint monitoring and evaluation framework to track the progress of each third-party community-led action project and assess their collective impact.In order to ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps concerning the provision of all three types of support described above, the proposals should work closely with other Horizon Europe projects, particularly Prep4Blue, the relevant Mission lighthouse CSA projects (EcoDaLLi[7], BlueMissionAA[8], BlueMissionMed[9], BlueMissionBANOS[10]), the project selected under HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-02, the public procurement prepared under Other Actions of WP 2022 'Studies to support communities of actors to achieve the EU Mission: Restore our Ocean and Waters objectives”, and the Mission Implementation Platform (MIP), notably with the work MIP does on deployment and upscaling of solutions. The proposals may also collaborate with and build on the experience of relevant existing networks, partnerships and initiatives[11], as well as take into account relevant strategic research and innovation agendas and regional strategies.The projects resulting from this call should be implemented in close collaboration with the relevant EC service(s) and the Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat[12] to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission.Proposals should be flexible enough to accommodate for some adjustments that may be requested by the Commission before the grant agreement signature to ensure complementarity of activities between the lighthouse CSA projects, Prep4Blue, the Mission Implementation Platform, and the project selected under topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-02.

Scope:A 'New European Bauhaus hub for results and impacts' is required to collect, centralise, manage, monitor and exploit the knowledge produced by the NEB projects, the NEB Community and other relevant NEB actions (e.g. projects resulting from EU-funded calls dedicated to NEB across the different EU programmes, NEB Lab) while also ensuring cooperation and collaboration between them. By having an overview of all the knowledge produced, the progress made, the challenges faced and the research gaps yet to overcome, the hub will be an agile instrument that will contribute to informing the implementation of the NEB Facility and will help to increase its impact. Ultimately, it will contribute to advancing the objectives of the NEB in a coherent manner.It will cover all the disciplines relevant for NEB and reflect the transversal, holistic nature of the initiative.Proposals are expected to address all of the following: Collection of knowledge Develop and implement a methodology and working methods to collect the knowledge, results, processes and solutions resulting from NEB projects, the NEB Community and other relevant NEB actions (e.g. projects resulting from EU-funded calls dedicated or relevant to NEB across the different EU programmes, NEB Lab, etc.) and other relevant initiatives (e.g. EU Missions and their platforms, Built4People innovation clusters, EUI Portico, URBACT Knowledge Hub, etc.);Conduct and set standards for comparative analysis and presentation of knowledge, results, approaches and solutions resulting from NEB projects, the NEB Community and other relevant NEB actions; Knowledge Management Consult the stakeholders inside and outside of the NEB Community that will benefit of the New European Bauhaus Hub for results and impacts and tailor the hub and its actions to their needs;Set up a hub that will centralise, store, process and make publicly available in a user-friendly, tailored and effective way the relevant knowledge produced by NEB projects and NEB relevant actions as well as by the NEB Community;Based on initial information sources and guidance to be provided by the Commission, analyse and develop a consolidated list of EU-funded projects that the Commission will use to build and update a thematic portfolio of projects relevant for the implementation of the NEB initiative in general and for the NEB Facility in particular [1]. Monitoring and analysis Analyse and summarise the results of NEB projects and relevant actions to turn them into actionable knowledge for all different stakeholders (e.g. for urban design, for the revision of spatial development plans, etc.). Ensure its accessibility and attractiveness;Taking 2024 as baseline, develop a monitoring system to measure the impact of future projects funded by the NEB Facility (including their contributions to climate change mitigation and adaption) as well as the progress with the uptake and deployment of their results, approaches and solutions. Links and synergies with existing assessment systems (e.g. Level(s), NEB Labelling Strategy) and relevant tools (notably the NEB Compass) are encouraged;Learning from the results and achievements of all NEB activities, identify the R&I gaps, bottlenecks, and future needs that could be addressed to facilitate the implementation of the NEB Facility. The consortium is expected to develop and provide a method and plan detailing how the New European Bauhaus Hub for results and impacts will be operated, kept up-to-date and adapted to emerging needs. It will also ensure that the hub developed uses European Commission's IT tools such as the Open EUROPA Drupal platform[2] and complies with the Europa Component Library[3], the NEB visual identity and the Commission's accessibility and usability rules. The consortium will also ensure that the Commission can access the back office of the hub's system and that the latter can be transferred to another consortium or the Commission at the end of the project. The project is expected to last at least two years.Proposals should demonstrate how they will secure the necessary knowledge and expertise in areas relevant for the NEB[4]. [1]The project portfolio will be an interactive tool to be developed by the Commission. It will take inspiration in the NEB Dashboard (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/about/dashboard_en) as well as in other thematic project portfolios developed by the Commission.[2]https://github.com/openeuropa[3]Europa Component Library[4]Such as architecture and civil engineering (incl. sustainable and green architecture, adaptive reuse and historic preservation, smart buildings and home automation); spatial planning (incl. landscape architecture) governance and development; entrepreneurship and venture capital; social sciences; culture and creative industries and sectors; emerging industries; research & innovation; climate, energy and natural resources, urban circularity and regeneration; ecosystem services and nature-based solutions; public health and well-being in cities; urban resilience; social impacts of climate change. Additional transversal areas would also be relevant: research and innovation, monitoring & evaluation; (innovation) procurement; advocacy, communications & citizen engagement; digital services, artificial intelligence, machine learning and use of data; knowledge translation, innovation and evidence-informed policymaking.",,"The European Union is moving ahead with its goals to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least net 55% by 2030 while increasing climate resilience. It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[ https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(https://craft-cities.eu/)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[COM(2020) 662 final]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent”, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see 'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe']]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.Innovative funding and financing models are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions. These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.R&I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Covenant of Mayors and past and ongoing relevant projects funded by Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, such as STARTS, as well as with other EU programmes such as LIFE-CET, LIFE-Circular Economy, URBACT, Green City Accord and European Green Capital/Leaf awards.",,,

The concept of 'associated regions' is implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (see the Specific Conditions table for this topic). 'Associated regions' are understood as regions with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to improve fish habitats. The projects should ensure that the 'associated regions' are not already involved in the demonstration sites covered by the projects. The partners should proactively reach out to the 'associated regions' to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those 'associated regions' and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement sustainable, balanced and effective fish habitat protection and connectivity at a river basin scale in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives.

The objective of this Mission is to restore, protect and preserve the health of our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The Mission is designed to deliver on the European Union's 2030 quantified and measurable targets for protecting and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, for zero pollution, and for decarbonisation and net greenhouse gas emissions reduction towards climate-neutrality, within the EU's ocean, seas and waters. The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[ https://www.oceandecade.org/]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf]].The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives: Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[ COM/2020/380 final]];Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[ COM/2021/400 final]];Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[ COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[ COM/2021/240 final]]. The Mission will be implemented in two phases:In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up. The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&I funding instruments (European and national), align R&I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU. Activities to further enhance the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and to further engage with citizens are also covered.",,,,

They support the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' dealing with urgent soil health challenges (see in particular specific objectives 1 to 6 and 8 in the Mission implementation plan). Activities should thereby contribute to meeting the European Green Deal ambitions and targets, such as those related to food and nutrition security, climate, biodiversity, environment and rural areas [1].Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.Practice-oriented knowledge and tools are more easily available to land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regard to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies. Scope:While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and 'green” European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.Nowadays, there exist various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users [2]. For the purpose of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', soil health living labs are defined as 'user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption”.Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level [3]. Individual sites could be, e.g., farms, forest stands, urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions.Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as 'places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement”. They are individual, local sites (one farm, one forest exploitation, one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context (e.g., the land use(s), the soil health challenge(s) addressed), applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites. By working together on themes of common interest, the various actors involved in a living lab will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.More specifically, each of the funded projects should:Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, as applicable to the land use(s) and purpose of the project) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s), addressing the same or several land use types. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission's specific objectives [4]. Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, pedo-climatic conditions, land uses, Mission objectives addressed). Living labs exclusively focused on urban areas [5] are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme.Establish, based on the projects' goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s), taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Living labs working in the area of agriculture are expected to promote sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and benefit both conventional and organic farming. Living labs working on forestry, peat and natural areas are expected to address sustainable management for healthy soils in conjunction with productive biomass and other ecosystem services.Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the Soil Mission Implementation Plan and the descriptors of the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience.Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators.Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes. In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach. The list of actors will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and can involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public administrations, representatives of civil society (e.g., consumers, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, depending on their area of expertise. For example, while some partners may lead the conceptual work and coordinate the work within and across living labs, others may focus on carrying-out experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or be involved in outreach activities.To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties [6].Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of actors in one or more of the living labs can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.Applicants are reminded they can benefit from the services of NATI00NS, the project dedicated to support potential applicants to the living labs topics.In order to increase impact and sustainability, applicants are encouraged to explore and test new (or combination with existing) funding schemes and financial instruments, either public or private (including, for example and for agricultural land, Common Agricultural Policy eco-schemes), involving, where relevant, the finance providers such as public authorities or financial institutions and investors.Projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of SOILL[7], the dedicated 'Living Lab Support Structure' established to provide tailor made advice to participants of living labs and lighthouses in their day-to-day operations, as well as enforce the monitoring of their activities in a systematic way, reporting on the main outcomes and experiences [8]. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to collaborate with SOILL as well as with other projects relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s), funded either under the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' or under other parts and pillars of Horizon Europe or other EU programmes, as appropriate. For the latter these would include networking, attendance to meetings and organisation of joint activities (e.g., workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities). The details of the joint activities would be further defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and the life of the project.Additionally, funded projects should collaborate with BENCHMARKS and AI4SoilHealth, which are key projects looking at sampling, monitoring, validation and further development of indicators and proxy measurements for soil health, as well as using AI technology to accelerate the collection and use of soil health information.Cooperation with relevant networks active at local level, such as EU CAP Network operational groups for agricultural soils, is encouraged in order to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders in living labs activities or in the dissemination of solutions. The projects should also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs), the 'European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition: Agroecology living labs and research infrastructures' or the 'Partnership for Sustainable Food Systems (SFS) for people, planet and climate', which will also support living labs.Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project SoilWISE. In particular, proposals should ensure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be available publicly through the EUSO.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[ In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.Land managers[[ The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.'Soil literacy”, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[ https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices. Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[ https://ejpsoil.eu/]]).Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[ An'(end-) user” of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions. In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[ For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[ see https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[ The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format]].For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[ see https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups]], is strongly recommended.",,,,

Scope:Fellowships will be provided to excellent researchers undertaking international mobility. Applications will be made jointly by the researcher and a beneficiary in the academic or non-academic sector.Postdoctoral Fellowships either can take place in Europe (i.e. in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country) or in a Third Country not associated to Horizon Europe:European Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&I projects by either coming to Europe from any country in the world or moving within Europe. The standard duration of these fellowships must be between 12 and 24 months.Global Postdoctoral Fellowships are open to European nationals or long-term residents[1] who wish to engage in R&I projects with organisations outside EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. These fellowships require an outgoing phase of minimum 12 and maximum 24 months in a non-associated Third Country, and a mandatory 12-month return phase to a host organisation based in an EU Member State or a Horizon Europe Associated Country. Specific eligibility conditions apply to MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in the research areas covered by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025[1].SecondmentsResearchers receiving a Postdoctoral Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods.For European Postdoctoral Fellowships, secondments cannot exceed one third of the requested duration of the action (excluding from the duration of the action any additional period for a non-academic placement) and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.For Global Postdoctoral Fellowships, optional secondments are permitted for up to one third of the outgoing phase. A maximum of three months of such secondments can be spent at the start of the project at the beneficiary (or associated partners linked to the beneficiary), allowing the researcher to spend time there before going to the associated partner in the Third Country. This period of maximum three months will be considered as part of the outgoing phase.Secondments cannot take place during the mandatory twelve-month return period to the host organisation in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.Placements in the non-academic sectorPostdoctoral Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[3]. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement must be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country[4]. The request for such a non-academic placement must be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.If the placement does not meet the requirements (taking place in an academic organisation or in a Third Country), the proposal will be evaluated without taking into account the placement. This might affect the final score.Training activitiesThe training activities implemented under the Postdoctoral Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g. commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science etc.).Career Development PlanIn order to equip MSCA postdoctoral fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher. In addition to research objectives, this plan should comprise the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The Plan will have to be submitted as a project deliverable at the beginning of the action and can be updated when needed.EuratomAiming to enhance nuclear expertise and excellence as well as synergies between Programmes, organisations active in nuclear research established in one of EU Member States or countries associated to the Euratom Research and Training programme 2021-2025, are eligible to participate[5]. MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships in this area of research will be supported by the Euratom Research and Training Programme 2021-2025 through an indicative annual financial contribution of EUR 1 million to the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships call[6].ERA FellowshipsThe ERA Fellowships implemented through Work Programme Annex 11, Widening Participation and Strengthening the European Research Area, provide specific support to researchers to undertake their fellowship in a widening country[7]. This will help spread excellence and contribute to fostering balanced brain circulation in widening countries.

The activities will be tailor-made to the needs and priorities of the NCPs concerned and may include benchmarking, joint workshops, enhanced cross-border brokerage events, training sessions linked to the MSCA and wider R&I priorities and tools, twinning and mentoring schemes. Special attention will be given to enhancing the competence of MSCA NCPs, including helping newcomers and less experienced NCPs to rapidly acquire the know-how accumulated by their peers. Cooperation with other EU networks such as Euraxess Worldwide, Enterprise Europe Network, COST, will be encouraged to increase the visibility to potential beneficiaries, especially in the non-academic sector.Addressing the R&I gapThere still is a research and innovation gap across Europe and discrepancies remain between European countries in their capacity to attract funding and researchers. This gap is observed in the MSCA as well, and specific measures to support the NCPs in 'widening countries,” such as training and mentorship schemes, should be organised to stimulate more high-quality applications with beneficiaries in these countries and increase their success rate in MSCA.Attract researchers from third countriesThe MSCA are the main EU instrument to attract researchers from Third Countries to Europe. Specific measures to encourage Third-Country NCPs to create contacts and participate in the activities of the project (e.g. training, twinning, mentoring, and other capacity building and networking activities) should be foreseen.The focus throughout should be on issues specific to the MSCA and should not duplicate actions foreseen in the NCP network under 'Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area”.The consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs and include NCPs from widening countries.Submission of a single proposal is encouraged.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing, to some of the following expected outcomes:Public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private ones, in the area of health and care stimulate the competitive development of market-ready, environmentally sustainable innovative solutions (materials, technologies and systems/practices). These solutions take into consideration the green deal ambitions on zero pollution, climate neutrality and circular economy, while increasing the overall sustainability of the sector.Procurers open up opportunities for European health and technology industry actors (including start-ups/SMEs) to bring to the market innovations that are cost-efficient, safe and proven to increase environmental sustainability while improving or at least maintaining health outcomes and access to care for patients.Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of environmentally sustainable innovative solutions by their successful suppliers through providing them with first customer references for the validation and first pilot deployment.Policymakers, health care providers and professionals, patients and carers - each in their respective areas - exchange and adopt good practices and the best solutions and technologies that the market can deliver to reduce carbon emissions and minimise waste and pollution stemming from health and care provision, in line with the Green Deal ambitions. Scope:The healthcare sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions[1] contributing significantly to Europe's carbon footprint and to the generation of large amounts of plastics and other waste, including chemical waste through the discharge of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic chemicals as well as disinfectants and antimicrobial resistant pathogens into the wastewater system. Good hygiene and safety are vital in this setting however innovative solutions can help to reduce the environmental impact of the healthcare sector through the efficient use of resources, increasing circularity, and the introduction of 'greener” materials, technologies and practices.Up to now the healthcare sector has not significantly embraced the green transition. However, pressure is increasing as demonstrated by the launch of the first ever Declaration on Climate and Health[2] by the UAE COP28 presidency. The declaration calls for action and joint vision on ensuring better health outcomes, in part through the transformation of health and care systems to become climate-resilient, low-carbon, sustainable, circular and equitable. Such a transformation will contribute in the long term to improving patient care by enhancing both the sustainability and overall efficiency of health and care systems.Pre-commercial procurement (PCP) actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to procure together the development of innovative solutions for greening the health and care systems. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform R&D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon Europe work programme.As every step in health and care delivery has a role in reducing its environmental footprint, the topic can support any of the different dimensions and needs for the greening of the healthcare sector.Proposals should target either:Direct and indirect footprint deriving from the provision and/or delivery of care (excluding infrastructural elements related to building, transport logistics and food footprints).Circularity, waste production and treatment.Footprint from the chain of suppliers in making and delivering products, or services.More efficient use of resources, decreasing the overall sector footprint while addressing the constantly increasing demand for healthcare. Focus should be on solutions that are specific to the healthcare sector therefore proposals targeting general infrastructure (energy efficiency of buildings such cooling, heating and ventilation, vehicles, construction or refurbishment), energy supply or food and catering services do not fall within scope. Within this topic, it is possible to foresee the transfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health and care systems. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovation.Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. clinical teams, patients or hospital structures etc) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to potentially interested suppliers.Involvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by health and care systems increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to purchase at least one solution resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will (1) procure the solution(s) as part of the PCP or (2) in a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP. In the first case, procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP (see general annex H) and foresee the budget to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers must include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase successful solution(s) after the PCP.

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact areas 'Good health and high-quality accessible health care' and 'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats', and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: 'Health care systems provide equal access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care thanks to the development and uptake of safe, cost-effective and people-centred solutions, with a focus on population health, health systems resilience, as well as improved evidence-based health policies'. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: 'Climate change mitigation and adaptation', 'High quality digital services for all' and 'A Competitive and secure data economy'.Health systems are affected by limitations in sustainability and resilience, challenges which have been reinforced by the COVID-19 crisis that has also revealed inequalities in access to high-quality health care services. Our health systems need to become more effective, efficient, accessible, fiscally and environmentally sustainable, and resilient in order to cope with public health emergencies, to adapt to environmental challenges like climate change and to contribute to social justice and cohesion. Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems.Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should improve governance and provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens' health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:Accelerating the development of personalised medicine in the EU and Associated Countries, especially through a public-public cofunded partnership on personalised medicineIncreasing access to health and care services for patients and citizens, and especially for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of discriminationImproving the resilience and mental wellbeing of the health and care workforce, including informal carersEnhancing development and uptake of research and innovation in health and care systems, including environmental transformation of the systems and contributions to the European Green Deal. In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 2 'Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society” such as on health economics and economic models, on cost-effectiveness, fiscal sustainability and accessibility of health care, or on adaptation of public health systems to societal challenges (climate change, environmental degradation, migration, demographic change, emerging epidemics and One Health AMR) thereby contributing to building resilience; with cluster 3 'Civil Security for Society” such as on security of health care infrastructures, incl. digital health infrastructures, health systems preparedness and response to disasters and other emergencies, and quality and safety of medicine (counterfeit and substandard medicine, illicit drugs, One Health AMR); with cluster 4 'Digital, Industry and Space” such as on cybersecurity of (public) health systems, products and infrastructures of digitalised health and care, or on health impact assessment (e.g. related to consumer products, working place innovation); with cluster 5 'Climate, Energy and Mobility”; and cluster 6 'Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment”.Expected impacts:Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Health and social care services and systems have improved governance mechanisms and are more effective, efficient, accessible, resilient, trusted and sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally. Health promotion and disease prevention will be at their heart, by shifting from hospital-centred to community-based, people-centred and integrated health care structures and successfully embedding technological innovations that meet public health needs, while patient safety and quality of services are increased.Health care providers are trained and equipped with the skills and competences suited for the future needs of health care systems that are modernised, digitally transformed and equipped with innovative tools, technologies and digital solutions for health care. They save time and resources by integrating and applying innovative technologies, which better involve patients in their own care, by reorganising workflows and redistributing tasks and responsibilities throughout the health care system, and by monitoring and analysing corresponding health care activities.Citizens are supported to play a key role in managing their own health care, informal carers (including unpaid carers) are fully supported (e.g. by preventing overburdening and economic stress) and specific needs of more vulnerable groups are recognised and addressed. They benefit from improved access to health care services, including financial risk protection, timely access to quality essential health care services, including safe, effective, and affordable essential medicines and vaccines.Health policy and systems adopt a holistic approach (individuals, communities, organisations, society) for the evaluation of health outcomes and value of public health interventions, the organisation of health care, and decision-making. The actions resulting from the calls under this destination will also create strong opportunities for synergies with the EU4Health programme and in particular to contribute to the goals under the general objective 'protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and specific objective 4 'to strengthen health systems, their resilience and resource efficiency”.",,,

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:The EU's response to curb antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is improved and the EU is reinforced as an internationally recognised driver of research and innovation on AMR thereby substantially contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to AMR;EU and national agencies, the scientific communities, policymakers and funders enhance their collaboration and coordination for a strengthened 'One Health (OH) approach to fight antimicrobial resistance' forming a strong and structured ecosystem with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;Research funders, policymakers, relevant agencies and authorities, and the research community are in a position to close the current gaps and break existing silos on AMR in accordance with the European One Health Action Plan against AMR[1] and the EU Council Recommendation to combat antimicrobial resistance in a one health approach[2];Research funders align, adopt and implement their research policies and activities allowing for the optimal generation of novel solutions to prevent and treat infectious diseases affected by AMR, improved surveillance and diagnosis and control of the spread of resistant microorganisms, testing and validation of such solutions and facilitating their uptake or implementation responding to the needs to reduce the burden of AMR;The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised actor for research and innovation on AMR with a one health approach substantially contributing to global cooperation and coordination by expanding beyond Europe;The research community at large benefit from and use an improved comprehensive knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information infrastructures to improve transnational research. Scope:The partnership should contribute to the priorities set in the European One Health Action plan to fight AMR and in the Council Recommendation on stepping up EU actions to combat antimicrobial resistance in a One Health approach that provide European frameworks with actions and objectives focused on areas with the highest added value for Member States, including boosting research development and innovation.In this, the European Partnership One Health AMR should allow coordinating, aligning of activities and funding among countries in the EU and beyond, as well as facilitating national coherence on research and innovation between different services/ministries with responsibility for the various aspects of AMR and sectors involved (e.g. human and animal health, agriculture, environment, innovation).This Partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe[3], in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs on AMR and ensuring that the benefits of innovation reach patients in the EU, and support the objectives of the new EU4Health Programme[4], as well as supporting the objectives of the Farm to Fork Strategy[5].Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, citizens, healthcare providers, innovators, policymakers), the Partnership will create a critical mass of resources and implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA)[6].The co-funded European Partnership on One Health AMR should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from coordinating transnational research efforts to other activities such as coordination and networking activities, capacity building programmes, brokerage and mobility programmes, work on research infrastructures and resources, including training and dissemination activities.The implementation of the future European Partnership on OH AMR should contribute to build a European Research and Innovation Area (ERA) to rapidly and jointly support research and innovation in the fight against AMR.It should be structured along the following 3 main objectives:1. Collaboration and alignment of Research and Innovation agendas on OH AMRThe Partnership should mobilise and link key AMR stakeholders, encompassing the human, veterinary, agricultural and environmental disciplines and including a broad spectrum of pathogens, bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, through a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary one health approach. It should provide a framework to close the current knowledge gaps and break existing silos in the AMR research landscape, facilitating the integration of national and international scientific and policy communities with industry and the civil society.For this, the partnership could support, although no limited to, the following activities:Joint strategic programming and global coordination of research and innovation through an agreed One Health AMR SRIA to understand, prevent and tackle AMR (covering the scientific areas Therapeutics, Surveillance, Detection, Diagnostics, Transmission and Evolution, Interventions for Prevention and Mitigation, including implementation research, economic, environment and social sciences).Target research and innovation efforts to actual needs (challenge-driven) of policymakers and stakeholders.Create a transnational system that supports collaboration between EU, member states and international initiatives on AMR research and innovation in a One Health approach. 2. Boost Research and InnovationThe OH AMR Partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent, widening the engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.For this, the Partnership could support, although no limited to, the following activities:Support excellent AMR research and development with a one health approach on new prevention methods, interventions, treatments and diagnostics through annual joint transnational research calls and research network calls.Develop new tools and instruments to support research and innovation.Support networking, training and mobility of researchers.Facilitate sharing and use of data and research infrastructures. 3. Enhance knowledge translation and uptakeFacilitate translation of scientific knowledge into innovative solutions.Connect, merge and align dissemination of outputs with other initiatives to support evidence-based policy in whole One Health domain.Societal engagement by bridging science to society creating awareness of AMR challenges, value creation, support the wellbeing of citizens and sustainability of the environment. The partnership should also:Strengthen the OH AMR ecosystem with integrating activities engaging key actors for AMR encompassing the field of human, veterinary and environmental disciplines and the broad spectrum of pathogens, including fungi and viruses.Implement collaborative activities with International Organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Animal Health Organisation (WOAH), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), the G7 and G20 fora, and the global AMR R&D Hub, with the aim to avoid duplication of efforts. International cooperation is encouraged also with low- and middle-income countries where AMR is highly prevalent and prone to spread to Europe.Establish robust communication and effective information exchange between diverse scientific disciplines and among multiple sectors of the society (as patients, clinicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, food producers, pharmaceutical industry, policymakers and researchers (including those working in the socio-economic, social sciences and humanities).The Partnership's governance structure should engage upfront the relevant actors to coordinate, steer and frame the research and innovation activities, facilitate the use and uptake of the results and contribute to a science-based communication of the risk of spread of AMR. The Partnership's governance and operational structures should also foster a dialogue on sustainability, beyond funding from EU research and innovation framework programmes.The governance should involve key stakeholders, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, and innovation owners.The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join.The Partnership should build on, be complementary to and go beyond the existing initiative JPIAMR[7].To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalised and co-funded, such as the future European Partnership Animal Health & Welfare [8]) and missions as set out in the working document on 'Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe'[9] as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. The proposals should also consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health. The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data[10].Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and non-European institutions and experts may be considered. Participation of third countries is encouraged. Their commitments to the Partnership would not be eligible for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives.When defining calls for proposals, this Partnership needs to consider sex and gender characteristics. Also, it needs to consider if to require the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area 'Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare' and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: 'health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety'. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: 'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats', 'Climate change mitigation and adaptation', and 'High quality digital services for all'.Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[ Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated €115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[ AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission's political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 'Civil security for society” such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 'Digital, Industry and Space” such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 'Food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment” such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe's ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the 'Europe's Beating Cancer Plan”[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[ https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en]]. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.Expected impacts: Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care. In particular, patients are diagnosed early and accurately and receive effective, cost-efficient and affordable treatment, including patients with a rare disease, due to effective translation of research results into new diagnostic tools and therapies.Premature mortality from non-communicable diseases is reduced by one third (by 2030), mental health and well-being is promoted, and the voluntary targets of the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 are attained (by 2025), with an immediate impact on the related disease burden (DALYs)[[ WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 (resolution WHA66.10), https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241506236]],[[Including for instance the following voluntary targets (against the 2010 baseline): A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases; Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major non-communicable diseases in both public and private facilities.]], [[Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a quantitative indicator of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.]].Health care systems benefit from strengthened research and innovation expertise, human capacities and know-how for combatting communicable and non-communicable diseases, including through international cooperation. In particular, they are better prepared to respond rapidly and effectively to health emergencies and are able to prevent and manage communicable diseases transmissions epidemics, including within healthcare settings.Citizens benefit from reduced (cross-border) health threat of epidemics and AMR pathogens, in the EU and worldwide[[ WHO global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, 2015]], [[EU One Health Action Plan against AMR, 2017]].Patients and citizens are knowledgeable of disease threats, involved and empowered to make and shape decisions for their health, and better adhere to knowledge-based disease management strategies and policies (especially for controlling outbreaks and emergencies). The EU benefits from high visibility, leadership and standing in international fora on global health and global health security.",,,

In this regard, synergies and close collaboration with the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and other relevant European Commission services need to be ensured.The partnership's activities are expected to be key enablers of the EU Global Health Strategy[2], notably its guiding principle 5 to boost global health research and guiding principle 7 to strengthen capacities for prevention, preparedness and response, particularly to expand and strengthen European and global research partnerships including clinical trial networks that can be pivoted to address new and emerging pathogens.Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards, and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:The EU offers a valued network of clinical trial sites that have the capacity to implement well-coordinated large-scale multi-country quality trials in different target populations, which are able to smoothly transition to public health interventions relevant for cross-border health threats in response to a public health emergency;Relevant EU and national entities, the scientific communities and networks, policymakers and funders enhance their collaboration and coordination for strengthened research on pandemic preparedness and response, forming a strong and structured ecosystem with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;Research funders, policymakers, relevant EU and national entities, and the research community recognise and close rapidly relevant research and related infrastructure gaps and break existing silos on pandemic preparedness research and response;Healthcare authorities, regulatory authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use the research results to develop evidence-based strategies and policies for pandemic preparedness and response, and deploy good practices to European countries and regions, and beyond whenever relevant;The research community at large benefits from and uses an improved comprehensive knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information infrastructures to improve transnational research in the area of pandemic preparedness and response;The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised actor for pandemic preparedness research and response, as such substantially contributing to global cooperation and coordination. Scope:The COVID-19 pandemic uncovered the challenges that European health care systems face in detecting, preventing, combatting and managing outbreaks of infectious diseases in a coordinated manner. It also illustrated the need for stronger preparedness and networks for research and timely clinical trials and observational studies, for more timely availability of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as more appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions and adequate communication strategies in terms of fighting mis/disinformation and fostering appropriate behaviours. Furthermore, it showed how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a fragmented, inefficient research landscape.At the same time, the relentless work of the research community that has led to availability of several COVID-19 vaccines in record time highlighted the critical importance of collaborative R&I to respond rapidly to emerging health threats.Therefore, transformative investments in research for pandemic preparedness are needed at European level. Stronger collaboration and coordination between European actors, including the appropriate infrastructures and networks, are an important prerequisite for improving EU's pandemic preparedness and stepping up our contribution to global cooperation in this area.This should be done through a partnership that promotes:improved coordination and cooperation to adjust research and innovation agendas on national and European levels (and contributing globally), as essential part of the pandemic preparedness planning and implementation activities;coordination and prioritisation of a comprehensive research response to a health emergency, from basic research for better understanding of pathogens with pandemic potential to the development or adaptation of medical countermeasures, as well as effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and/or public health and social measures (PHSM), and using an integrated One Health approach;the consolidation and further development of ever-warm EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, controlled trials and observational studies for public health interventions, such as EU-wide vaccine and treatment trials, PHSM/NPI trials or cohorts;the provision of robust and timely scientific evidence to inform sound public health decision-making in response to a public health emergency;the use of agreed data standards[3] to safely collect, store, link and manage FAIR[4] data and to exploit the full potential of the generated data for modelling and in-silico methods for epidemic surveillance, clinical trials and observational studies, among others. The partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent, widening the engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.The partnership should endorse a pandemic preparedness Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) based on the work of the CSA BE READY and prepare for the management of the research response during a crisis, by strengthening the collaboration between relevant partners and the alignment of related investments. The partnership will consider the impact of environmental, climatic issues and patterns in relation with the emergence and spread of health threats to better understand how these increase the risk for emerging infectious diseases, and how this should be integrated into the research done using a One Health approach.The scope of the partnership should encompass:basic research to accelerate the acquisition of knowledge on the biology of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, their transmission and interaction with humans, animals and plants, in particular in view of emerging threats to human health. The initial focus should be on pathogens with high epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU, such as those included in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO), with particular attention to those meeting the criteria identified by HERA[5];preclinical research aimed at better understanding of human diseases caused by pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential and testing of related medical countermeasures;clinical research to support the generation of novel solutions, in particular the development (phase I to phase III) of medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and digital solutions, to prevent or mitigate outbreaks from pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, in line with the mission of HERA and the ACT EU initiative[6];a key feature should be the consolidation and further development of an ever-warm network of clinical trial sites[7] applying the same quality standards and ensuring a baseline of continuous clinical trial activity across a wide and diverse range of clinical trial sites, to allow for a rapid clinical trial response in case of an epidemic or pandemic. This includes the development of criteria for a clinical trial site to be considered as ever-warm;the development, testing and validation of new methods and tools, including those based on artificial intelligence and computer modelling, to improve surveillance and diagnosis and control of the spread of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential;the conduct of public health and social sciences and humanities (SSH) research for the development and robust evaluation of appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions/public health and social measures and effective communication strategies at all phases of a public health emergency;the consolidation and/or development of infrastructures, platforms and networks necessary for fast and timely start of the response research, capitalising on previous investments and existing infrastructures supporting collaboration, trans-boundary access and provision of services, such as provided by ISIDORe[8] or ECRIN[9].capacity building through networking and training of researchers, to share knowledge and good practices also with EU and national entities, policymakers and funders. It is intended to implement the partnership in two phases. The activities in the first phase should mainly focus on:the way clinical trials are set up and conducted in the EU to address public health emergencies, including new approaches such as computer modelling and in-silico clinical trials. this will require coordination mechanisms to support prioritisation of emergency trials, improved mechanisms to identify and rank promising compounds, mobilising EU and Member State funding mechanisms, and measures to help speed up contracting of clinical trial sites during emergencies and in preparedness time. For this purpose, close collaboration with the EMA and its Emergency Task Force, National Competent Authorities, Ethics Committees, and the European Commission should be ensured.this includes the consolidation, integration and further expansion of EU-wide network of ever-warm clinical trial sites, building on earlier made investments such as Vaccelerate[10], Ecraid[11] and EU RESPONSE[12]. It is expected that the partnership will develop a sustainable solution to ensure the long-term viability of adequate European clinical trial networks for a timely public health emergency response, which cover key target populations and have a suitable geographic spread. implementing joint calls for transnational proposals to foster transnational research in the other areas in the scope of the partnership.developing the roadmaps for the implementation of the remaining activities foreseen by the partnership. The second phase of the partnership is expected to build on this first phase, to further develop and consolidate what has been achieved and implement the roadmaps developed for remaining activities as outlined in the scope, with the possibility of expanding to new partners.The total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 100 million and subject to the effective implementation of the commitments made by the members of the consortium. The Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.The expected duration of the partnership is 7 to 10 years with the first phase having a duration of 2 to 3 years.General principlesAs general principles, the partnership will:promote an inclusive membership and balanced geographic representation, open to third countries and other relevant stakeholders;promote data sharing, data standards and data-based digital tools, and align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR[4] data, artificial intelligence and virtual human twins;pay specific attention to the gender and sex dimensions, as well as representativeness of different population groups including young people and vulnerable groups;foster the development and use of trustworthy artificial intelligence[14], in all its three dimensions (lawful, ethical and robust);ensure synergies and explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with the relevant European Commission services, with other Horizon Europe projects, partnerships (institutionalised and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on 'Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe'[15] as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health[16], the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)[17], the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)[18], the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)[19], InvestEU[20], the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)[21] and the Technical Support Instrument (TSI)[22].When defining calls for proposals, the partnership needs to consider the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.The partnership should create synergies with the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) currently in its third iteration as Global Health EDCTP3[23] Joint Undertaking, that brings together 15 countries from Europe and 25 countries from sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP is already funding adaptive clinical trial networks spanning African and European countries and a Clinical Trials Community Network[24] The partnership should also contribute to help achieve the goals of GloPID-R[25], the coalition of research funders that invests in research to improve pandemic preparedness & response.The partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration. Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and non-European institutions and experts may be considered.GovernanceThe partnership's governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should involve key stakeholders and interested parties, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, public health authorities, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations, innovation owners, and relevant EU entities, including the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency.ResourcesThe proposal should pool the necessary cash and in-kind resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes, in order to:sustain and further develop the EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, and in particular a network of ever-warm clinical trial sites by running continuous preparedness trials in relevant target populations;implement joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives;conduct capacity building activities;implement any other activities, coordinated between (a group of) partnership members, that contribute to the achievement of the partnership's objectives. Research projects resulting from coordinated national calls could be envisaged in this context as well.

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area 'Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare' and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: 'health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety'. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: 'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats', 'Climate change mitigation and adaptation', and 'High quality digital services for all'.Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[ Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated €115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[ AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission's political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 'Civil security for society” such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 'Digital, Industry and Space” such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 'Food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment” such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe's ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the 'Europe's Beating Cancer Plan”[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[ https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en]]. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.Expected impacts: Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care. In particular, patients are diagnosed early and accurately and receive effective, cost-efficient and affordable treatment, including patients with a rare disease, due to effective translation of research results into new diagnostic tools and therapies.Premature mortality from non-communicable diseases is reduced by one third (by 2030), mental health and well-being is promoted, and the voluntary targets of the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 are attained (by 2025), with an immediate impact on the related disease burden (DALYs)[[ WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 (resolution WHA66.10), https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241506236]],[[Including for instance the following voluntary targets (against the 2010 baseline): A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases; Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major non-communicable diseases in both public and private facilities.]], [[Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a quantitative indicator of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.]].Health care systems benefit from strengthened research and innovation expertise, human capacities and know-how for combatting communicable and non-communicable diseases, including through international cooperation. In particular, they are better prepared to respond rapidly and effectively to health emergencies and are able to prevent and manage communicable diseases transmissions epidemics, including within healthcare settings.Citizens benefit from reduced (cross-border) health threat of epidemics and AMR pathogens, in the EU and worldwide[[ WHO global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, 2015]], [[EU One Health Action Plan against AMR, 2017]].Patients and citizens are knowledgeable of disease threats, involved and empowered to make and shape decisions for their health, and better adhere to knowledge-based disease management strategies and policies (especially for controlling outbreaks and emergencies). The EU benefits from high visibility, leadership and standing in international fora on global health and global health security.",,,

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have access to and use specific guidelines to implement health interventions that improve the availability of effective, equitable, efficient, integrated, patient-centred, safe, and timely care and the overall quality of life for people living with multiple long-term conditions including non-communicable diseases (NCDs).Public health managers and authorities, including from other relevant sector (e. g., social, culture) have access to improved insights and evidence on how to decrease the fragmentation of care for patients living with multiple chronic conditions, and ensure continuity of care across all stages of disease progression. They use this knowledge to design policies to reduce health inequities.Adopting an implementation science approach to studying interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs, researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding how the proposed interventions could be adopted in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations of HICs setting, taking into account specific social, political, economic and cultural contexts.Communities and local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs and thus contribute to deliver better health. Scope:The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD)[1], an alliance of international funding agencies representing over 80% of the world's public health research funding and the first collaboration of its kind to specifically address NCDs. The GACD supports implementation science to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members and aligned with the 9th GACD call.The topic is focused on implementation research for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs (MLTC NCD) in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations in HICs. Proposals should focus on implementation science around interventions that will generate evidence about when, for whom, and under what circumstances, patient-centred approaches can improve integrated care for patients with MLTC NCD.MLTC NCD refers to the co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions, at least one of which is an NCD. NCDs include for example cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, hypertension, haematological disorders, sleep disorders, and mental health disorders. The high prevalence of MLTC NCD is projected to rise with the ageing population and the increasing burden of NCDs. MLTC NCD has a profound impact on patients, and is associated with premature death, physical disability, substance abuse, poor quality of life, mental health issues, and financial difficulties from high costs of care. It is also associated with difficulties in adherence to and high rates of adverse effects from treatment with multiple medications. In addition, due to poor health and the complexity of managing their conditions, patients with MLTC NCD are high utilisers of health care systems, which is especially challenging in low-resourced contexts.Addressing MLTC NCD demands a shift from fragmented models of care, which treat individual health issues separately as they occur, to a more holistic integrated care model that provides a whole person focus on health management[2]. The current evidence suggests that primary healthcare[3], integrated and coordinated care, patient-centred interventions, digital health technology, and optimised medication therapy are key to improved management of MLTC NCD. However, implementing patient-centred strategies for treating MLTC NCD remains challenging and largely unexplored in disadvantaged contexts, especially in LMICs. Adapting and scaling such models is critical to improving quality of life; reducing disability; reducing the burden of caretaking on (typically female) family members and reducing health system costs.The proposed implementation research must focus on one or more evidence-based interventions (or complex interventions) known to promote integrated management of multiple long-term conditions, including NCDs. It should assess patient-centred interventions focused on patient management or self-management, or interventions that transform communities, clinical practice, and/or health systems. Applicants should justify the choice of intervention(s) and provide evidence of the intervention's effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and potential for long-term health and other impacts. Ideally, evidence of the intervention's real-world effectiveness should be supported by a well-conducted systematic review where available. As the evidence for how to manage MLTC NCD is still emerging, particularly in LMICs, a limited period of testing the effectiveness of an intervention that the applicant's team has adapted for local implementation is therefore usually appropriate.Applicants must explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study population(s) taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s) in which the study will take place. Applicants should justify why any adaptation will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).Proposals should address all of the following activities[4]:Provide a research plan using validated implementation research frameworks or hybrid design research;Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators;Specifically address health equity and the principles of Universal Health Coverage[5];Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous-Indigenous members of the project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy;Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from key stakeholders for delivering patient-centred care and a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention after the funding ends;Provide opportunities for implementation research capacity building for early career researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or disadvantaged communities.Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one early career member as a co-investigator. Applicants are also encouraged to follow a life course approach, adapting the intervention to one or more key life stage(s) critical for reducing the onset or progression of MLTC NCD, and to explore how to best implement digital technology interventions.The study population may include patients with existing MLTC NCD, or existing NCDs (e.g., studies focusing on rolling out screening services for multiple NCDs). The study population may also include patients with chronic infectious disease(s) (e.g., studies that focus on integrating NCD management into an HIV or tuberculosis clinic) or a mixture of both.The following are potential interventions or strategies that applicants may consider in their implementation plan (please note that this is not an exhaustive list):Strategies for improving MLTC NCD identification, stratification/staging, management, and/or monitoring such as investigating strategies for adapting and implementing the protocol(s) described in the WHO Package of Essential NCD Interventions (WHO PEN)[6] that address MLTC NCD management. For example, projects may focus on integrating NCD care into clinics that typically focus on the management of infectious diseases, such as HIV or tuberculosis clinics, or the integration of NCD care into maternal and child health clinics;Strategies to streamline and improve quality of care among individuals with MLTC NCD to reduce fragmentation of services, including task-sharing and/or the use of clinical decision-making tools (e.g., digital tools);Strategies and/or tools (e.g., digital tools) that optimise appropriate medication and (non-pharmacological) therapeutic prescribing, adherence, and/or reduced drug interactions/ adverse effects;Interventions that improve transitions through the health system, from community to primary to tertiary care and beyond, such as to home care or hospice;Health behavioural change interventions that target different risk factor clusters (e.g., exercise, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse). The proposal's primary outcome measures must be implementation research outcomes to assess MLTC NCD. With regard to MLTC NCD, applicants are encouraged to explore any combination of chronic conditions, including mental health disorders and sleep disorders. The specific combination of conditions should be justified using local or regional epidemiological data about their co-occurrence. Outcome measures should appropriately address implementation tackling MLTC NCD, and not focus on one condition. Proposals may also contain a strategy for measuring other secondary outcomes (or proxy outcomes) that demonstrate the intervention's real-world effectiveness in the local context and target populations. Additionally, other health or non-health outcome measures, especially those identified as important by patient participants and/or critical for advancing Universal Health Coverage, are also welcome.Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider the social determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g., gender, ethnicity), then the reason for this should be justified.In order to promote health equity, proposals should aim to address differences in intervention access, uptake, and effectiveness in socially disadvantaged groups and develop strategies for reducing inequities. To facilitate this process at the data analysis stage, studies should be designed to address such differences. At a minimum, studies should capture sex and/or gender differences. If feasible, a plan for capturing intersectional impacts on health outcomes should be included in the analysis strategy.This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.For implementation research to have a strong likelihood of being taken up into policy or practice and informing the scale up of effective interventions, it is vital that project teams engage the appropriate stakeholders. Proposals should present a strategy to include the relevant decision makers such as policymakers, ministry officials, local authorities, non-governmental organisation leaders, community leaders as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organizations involved in the implementation of the intervention, from the development to the implementation knowledge translation phase. It is also important to include stakeholders who can help sustain the project's implementation, facilitate scale up, and use the knowledge generated from the project after the grant ends.Stakeholders also include patients, their family members and carers. Their contributions should be nurtured through meaningful engagement from the outset, not only as participants in the research undertaken. Patient engagement throughout the research project is critical to developing patient-centred models of care.All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the Annual Scientific Meetings of the GACD, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for such activities and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See definition of clinical studies in the introduction to this work programme part. [1]https://www.gacd.org/[2]In keeping with the principles of Universal Health Coverage, the World Health Organization advocates that health systems move towards offering a continuum of quality NCD preventative, diagnostic, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative care services, that are available and accessible to all, independent of economic circumstances.[3]https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/primary-health-care[4]The following types of projects will NOT be funded: i) proposals focused on primary prevention of NCDs or other chronic conditions; ii) proposals with the primary aim of informing the development and/or selection of an intervention for a given context, where the implementation component will be explored in a future project; iii) epidemiological cohorts; iv) etiological work, mechanistic, or epidemiological research, unless an essential component of a focused study to develop implementation research approaches; v) clinical trials, validation studies, or intervention efficacy studies for a new or established pharmacological agent or behavioural intervention.[5]https://www.who.int/health-topics/universal-health-coverage[6]https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241598996",,"Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation KSO-D 'Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society' of Horizon Europe's Strategic Plan 2021-2024. Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area 'Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare' and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: 'health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety'. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: 'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats', 'Climate change mitigation and adaptation', and 'High quality digital services for all'.Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[ Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated €115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[ AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission's political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 'Civil security for society” such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 'Digital, Industry and Space” such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 'Food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment” such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe's ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the 'Europe's Beating Cancer Plan”[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[ https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en]]. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.Expected impacts: Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care. In particular, patients are diagnosed early and accurately and receive effective, cost-efficient and affordable treatment, including patients with a rare disease, due to effective translation of research results into new diagnostic tools and therapies.Premature mortality from non-communicable diseases is reduced by one third (by 2030), mental health and well-being is promoted, and the voluntary targets of the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 are attained (by 2025), with an immediate impact on the related disease burden (DALYs)[[ WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 (resolution WHA66.10), https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241506236]],[[Including for instance the following voluntary targets (against the 2010 baseline): A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases; Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major non-communicable diseases in both public and private facilities.]], [[Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a quantitative indicator of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.]].Health care systems benefit from strengthened research and innovation expertise, human capacities and know-how for combatting communicable and non-communicable diseases, including through international cooperation. In particular, they are better prepared to respond rapidly and effectively to health emergencies and are able to prevent and manage communicable diseases transmissions epidemics, including within healthcare settings.Citizens benefit from reduced (cross-border) health threat of epidemics and AMR pathogens, in the EU and worldwide[[ WHO global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, 2015]], [[EU One Health Action Plan against AMR, 2017]].Patients and citizens are knowledgeable of disease threats, involved and empowered to make and shape decisions for their health, and better adhere to knowledge-based disease management strategies and policies (especially for controlling outbreaks and emergencies). The EU benefits from high visibility, leadership and standing in international fora on global health and global health security.",,,

Scope:Proposals should support the networking and coordination of national activities in support of the Quantum Flagship by implementing calls for proposals resulting primarily in grants to third parties in this area, in accordance with the provisions of the General Annexes. Of importance is how the proposals address: i) the gaps in the Strategic Research Agenda, not covered by the Flagship activities; (ii) support transnational efforts in guaranteeing availability of critical technologies, materials and resources essential for a competitive development of next generation quantum technologies and central to strategic supply chains for an autonomous and technologically sovereign pan-European quantum ecosystem; (iii) support early-stage involvement of industry in transnational R&D agendas to next generation quantum technologies, emphasizing high inclusion and participation of SME and start-ups in realizing an innovative and agile pan-European quantum ecosystem.Proposals should make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the Quantum Flagship and in particular contribute to the activities of the existing Quantum Coordination and Support Action. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 1-4 and achieve TRL up to 6 by the end of the project - see General Annex B",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO A, 'Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations.'KSO C, 'Making Europe the first digitally led circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact:Open strategic autonomy in digital technologies and in future emerging enabling technologies, by strengthening European capacities in key parts of digital and future supply chains, allowing agile responses to urgent needs, and by investing in early discovery and industrial uptake of new technologies. Electronic and photonic components, and the software that defines how they work, are the key digital technologies that underpin all digital systems. As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates, most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe's autonomy, particularly in periods of geopolitical instability, exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components, Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment, electric and autonomous vehicles, manufacturing and production plants and equipment, telecom networks, aerospace vehicles, consumer productsR&I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide, with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times, to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality ('Internet of Senses”). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.Despite a strong European scientific community's on AI and robotics, Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, transport, agriculture, energy, construction), providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.While Europe is strong in many sectors, it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness, prosperity and sustainability, by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies, e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches, use of biological elements as part of technology, and sustainable smart materials. In particular, the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet, but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118), in particular its 'secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures' pillar, actions under this Destination will support Europe's open strategic autonomy, and reinforce and regain European industry's leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene, and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions, which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI, Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore, promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.As a result, this Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:European Innovation Leadership in Photonics The European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments, far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications, and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'Photonics'.AI, Data and Robotics Europe has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research, Europe's scientific community is leading in AI and robotics, but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion, less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology, with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies, only capture 10% of full potential use, and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, many AI, Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore, there is room for improved adoption by industry, which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&I, from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general, industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies, but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, public sector, utilities, retail, finance, insurance, transport, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, construction, media, creative and cultural industries, fashion, tourism, etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.When it comes to Robotics, Europe is leading in its industry, with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics' cognition, safety, manipulation, soft robotics, underwater and aerial robotics, with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare, agri-food[[The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming, fisheries, horticulture etc., as well as produce processing, ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.]], forestry, inspection and maintenance, logistics, construction, manufacturing, etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial, marine, ground, in-vivo and space).The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.Open Source for Cloud/Edge and Software Engineering Fundamentals to support Digital Autonomy The European strategy for data (COM(2020) 66) aims at creating a single market that will ensure Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This calls for the ability to handle the entire data life-cycle which in turn relies on the underlying computing infrastructure (from the hardware to the software).In the light of dominant players, bridging established computing models (High Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, edge-computing and other emerging computing architectures) becomes a critical success factor for enabling a computing continuum. Open computing architectures at many levels based on Open approaches spanning both software/hardware is thus a pre-requisite for Digital autonomy - notably when it comes to Cloud infrastructures where European players are falling short.Actions under this heading will thus support the next steps of development and adoption of Open technologies on different levels while fostering progress on responsible software engineering fundamentals.European leadership in Emerging and Enabling Technologies Europe's leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement, but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged, with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech, though, this intertwining is essential.The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe's future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm Shift Since 2018, the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe's scientific leadership and excellence in quantum, in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU's aims for quantum R&I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship's Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators, which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship, by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing, simulation, sensing and communication, in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership, capitalising on Europe's established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.The aim of the Commission's Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world, and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty, as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used, among others, for sensitive applications in the area of security, and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context, the EU must take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets, interests, autonomy and security, while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators, that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025, with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact, with applications in medicine, manufacturing, or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography, finance and many other sensitive domains.Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU's interests, as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications, sensors for autonomous vehicles, and the next generation of medical sensors.It is therefore clearly in the EU's interests to protect European research in these domains, the intellectual property that it generates, and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result, while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe's strategic dependencies). With this in mind, the Commission has decided that, in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation, communication, and sensing, only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.Graphene: Europe in the lead The starting point is the Graphene Flagship, launched in 2013, which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation, automotive, electronics, batteries, healthcare).The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes.Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Europe's open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI, data, robotics, quantum computing, and graphene, and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms.

Scope:Large artificial intelligence (AI) models refer to a new generation of general-purpose AI models (i.e., generative AI) capable of adapting to diverse domains and tasks without significant modification. Notable examples, such as OpenAI's GPT-4V and META's Llama 2 or DinoV2, have demonstrated a wide and growing variety of capabilities.The swift progression of large AI models in recent years holds immense potential to revolutionize various industries, due to their ability to adapt to diverse tasks and domains. For them to achieve their potential, access to vast data repositories, significant computing resources, and skilled engineers is required. A promising avenue of research is the development of multi-modal large AI models that can seamlessly integrate multiple modalities, including text, structured data, computer code, visual or audio media, robotics or IoT sensors, and remote sensing data.This topic centres around the development of innovative multimodal large AI models, covering both the training of foundation models and their subsequent fine-tuning. These models should show superior capabilities across a wide array of down-stream tasks. The emphasis is both on integrating new input data modalities into large AI models and on developing multimodal large AI models with either significantly higher capabilities and/or the ability to handle a greater number of modalities.Moreover, projects should contribute to reinforcing Europe's research excellence in the field of large AI models by driving substantial scientific progress and innovation in key large AI areas. This includes the development of novel methods for pretraining multimodal foundation models. Additionally, novel approaches to effective and efficient fine-tuning of such models should be pursued.Research activities should explore innovative methodologies for enhancing the representation, alignment, and interaction among the different data modalities, thereby substantially improving the overall performance and trustworthiness of these models. Advances in efficient computation for the pre-training, execution and fine-tuning of foundation models to reduce their computational and environmental impact, and increasing the safety of models are also topics of interest.Proposals should outline how the models will incorporate trustworthiness, considering factors such as explainability, security, and privacy in line with provisions in the upcoming Artificial Intelligence Act. Additionally, the models should incorporate characteristics that align with European values, and provide improved multilingual capabilities, where relevant.Proposals should address at least one of the following focus areas:the integration of innovative modalities of data for large AI models during training and inference. Examples of innovative modalities include event streams, structured data and sensor measurements. The incorporation of such new modalities could potentially bring unforeseen enhancements to model performance and enable their application in new domains like weather forecasting, robotics, and manufacturing.enhanced multimodal models that exceed the current state of the art, with either significantly improved capabilities or the ability to handle a larger number of modalities. This focus area also encompasses models capable of multi-modal output generation. Current large-scale multimodal models most commonly engage with only vision and language. Each proposal is expected to address all of the following:Data Collection, Processing and Cross-modal Alignment. The proposal should describe convincingly the characteristics and availability of the large, trustworthy data sources, as well as the trustworthy data processing to be utilised within the project, detailing the data processing steps to ensure reliability, accountability and transparency, and the alignment of data among the different modalities. A modest portion (up to 10%) of the budget may be allocated to data collection activities; proposals may involve relevant data owners in this task, if necessary. Importantly, the proposal should delineate how potential privacy and IPR issues associated with the data will be managed and mitigated.Multimodal Foundation Model Pretraining. The pretrained multimodal foundation model is expected to demonstrate high capabilities across a wide range of tasks. The pretraining tasks used should be agnostic of down-stream tasks. These activities also cover the development of the codebase and implementation of small-scale experiments. A minor portion (up to 10%) of the budget may be allocated for the acquisition of computing resources for codebase development and small-scale experiments, though the primary source of computing resources for pretraining should be sought from external high-performance computing facilities such as EuroHPC or National centres. The proposal should describe convincingly the strategy to access these computing resources.Fine-Tuning of Multimodal Foundation Models: The proposal should clearly detail the activities pursued to fine-tune the model for diverse downstream tasks demonstrating illustrative potential use-cases. The tasks' output may either be of a single modality or multimodality. Research activities should investigate innovative methodologies designed to bolster the interplay between different data modalities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of these models.Testing and Evaluation: The proposal should detail the development of workflows, benchmarks, testing procedures, and pertinent tools for evaluating both foundation and fine-tuned models. Attention should be paid to the performance, transparency, bias, robustness, accuracy, and security of the models, through appropriate testing procedures (e.g., red teaming for safety and security), in compliance with the future AI Act. Proposals should adopt a multidisciplinary research team, as appropriate, to cover all the above issues.Proposals should adhere to Horizon Europe's guidelines regarding Open Science practices as well as the FAIR data principles. Open access should be provided to research outputs - including training datasets, software tools, model architecture and hyperparameters, as well as model weights - unless a legitimate interest or constraint applies. Additionally, proposals are encouraged to deliver results under open-source licenses.All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring, including participation to international evaluation contests, as well as illustrative application use-cases demonstrating concrete potential added value), and share communicable results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform, and Common European data spaces, and if necessary other relevant digital resource platforms in order to enhance the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem through the sharing of results and best practice.Proposals are also expected to dedicate tasks and resources to collaborate with and provide input to the open innovation challenge under HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-04. Research teams involved in the proposals are expected to participate in the respective Innovation Challenges.This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on AI, data and robotics. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 2-3 and achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation. As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions, workers, regions, and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations, and will be differently affected by these changes, creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development, but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027). Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes. The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:Leadership in AI based on trust The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.EIT Digital plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ​An Internet of Trust The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.eXtended Reality (XR) Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and conditionThe objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry. This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade”), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.European standards for industrial competitiveness The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.International cooperation The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment). It will also contribute to the overarching objectives of our continental partnership in full alignment with the principles of the Global Gateway.Cooperation with Latin America will aim at exploiting the potential of the newly established BELLA network and implement the outcomes of EU-LAC dialogues in the context of digitalisation and R&I.Additionally, international collaboration is encouraged or targeted in several thematic areas may also be addressed within the respective Joint Undertakings (Smart Networks and Services, EuroHPC, and Key Digital Technologies).Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

This will include concrete indicators, source of information at national and European level, as well as the identification of existing, and development of new, capacity tools to support the uptake of identified best practice uses of digital technologies in support of digital humanism. This work will notably feed the review of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and of the solemn declaration in 2026. Scope:A horizontal and holistic approach is needed for creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to opportunities, societal changes, threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing protection and high-quality public services such as health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions.While digital technologies bring strong advantages coming along with a promise of freedom and innovation, negative aspects have also become visible in the last years. These include the monopolization of the information space, increasing levels of fake news and disinformation, strong power of online platforms, cyber threats and crimes, privacy breaches, strong market disparities as well as an economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales (Zuboff, 2019).Digital Humanism is here defined as the continuing search for a European answer to keep up high civilization standards stemming from enlightenment and the humanist era, and to further develop them in the digital world. In line with European values, such a digital environment should enable all Europeans to make full use of digital and technologies, to have a society where geographical distance matters less, so that all Europeans can benefit from the digitalisation in their daily activities (ranging from work, learning, to enjoying culture or leisure activities) but also in their interactions with governments, and participation in democratic processes.This requires intense, cross-disciplinary work of computer (and technology) sciences with legal, economic, sociological, philosophical and other kinds of expertise as a co-development exercise. To support in-depth, early-on collaboration between computer sciences and the whole wealth of humanities and social sciences to put new algorithms and models into a broader context, proposals under this topic should:Support the development of cross-disciplinary communities and networks in relation to digital transformation of society. It is thus critical to foster greater exchanges between social sciences and technological communities.Support the cross-disciplinary co-development of new theoretical models and approaches of the impact of digital technologies in our societies, starting with human and societal needs.Showcasing success stories and examples of engagement of the digital community seeking to develop concrete ways to progress toward a more human-centred digital world and draw concrete conclusions from these.Mapping out collaborative research to develop concrete tools and frameworks for ensuring that all actors of the European digital ecosystem (policy makers, business, startup developers, investors, NGOs) can integrate in their work and activities the values that form a human centred digital transformation and develop a roadmap for the possible development of research activitiesDevelop a conceptual framework as well as tools and indicators to monitor and promote the progress of the 'declaration on digital rights and principles' and its six chapters (putting people at the centre of the digital transformation; solidarity and inclusion; freedom of choice; participation in the digital public space; safety, security and empowerment; sustainability), notably to feed the review of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and of the solemn declaration in 2026. This project is also relevant in the policy context of the Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade”), which sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership. For the first time, societal and human centred objectives are fully integrated into a comprehensive governance mechanism at EU level including monitoring of the progress made by the digital transformation in reaching our collective values and quantitative digital targets (skills, infrastructures, digitalisation of business and public services).",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation.

These operational settings should include a) an onboard gravimeter and b) terrestrial networks of gravimeters, consisting of at least eight gravimeters in total.Identification of new use cases and provision of innovative quantum gravimeter services for these use cases.The network of quantum gravimeters developed and optimised as part of the project should be ready for integration into a multi-country initiative such as a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium. Scope:Quantum gravimeters (gravity sensors) can deliver high-sensitivity, real-time, non-invasive gravity measurements, with much greater precision than classical gravimeters. They have started to demonstrate their disruptive potential in many application sectors, including Earth observation and civil engineering. The unmatched precision offered by quantum gravimeters will only become more important in a world where extreme weather events are becoming more and more common, and where there is an even greater need to observe and track resources that are located up to several kilometres under the ground, such as water basins, gas deposits or magma concentrations.Under this action, a consortium of public laboratories, metrology institutes, scientific institutes and/or other relevant partners is expected to carry out innovation activities to develop and demonstrate the practical viability and usefulness of a network of quantum gravimeters in specific operational settings, both in the form of a terrestrial network and also mounted on flying carriers (these could include innovative carriers such as drones, balloons or other flying carriers) and/or on ships or other seaborne carriers. Mounted gravimeters are to be deployed flexibly in different locations as needed, in order to provide gravity maps of potential areas of interest and confirm where more detailed exploration is worth pursuing. Terrestrial networks are then to be deployed at those specific sites to enable high-resolution, reproductible measurements to be performed over time to monitor and investigate areas of interest (such as volcanoes or zones with underground reservoirs). In all cases, gravimeters should be operated in order to deliver results for innovative use cases in areas including, but not limited to, Earth observation, geodesy, oceanography, hydrology, volcano monitoring and civil engineering.Proposals should seek to:Deliver an extended proof-of-concept for deploying quantum gravimeters in innovative operational settings, including a) as terrestrial networks of several (8 to 10 in total) quantum gravimeters (possibly in hybrid mode with classical gravimeters and/or other types of quantum sensors such as magnetometers) and b) as individual quantum gravimeters mounted on flying carriers (which could include innovative carriers such as drones, balloons or other flying carriers) and/or on ships or other seaborne carriers. The proposal should detail the actions planned to procure gravimeters capable of carrying out the tasks needed to achieve the project's deliverables, including the adaptation of these gravimeters for use on mounted carriers.Develop the components, tools, techniques and processes for optimising and industrializing quantum gravimeters for these innovative configurations, by enhancing their performance according to parameters such as resolution, sensitivity, precision, reproducibility, integration time, autonomy, footprint, robustness, compactness, and real-time data processing. They should seek to optimise the network configuration and carriers for operating quantum gravimeters and assess exhaustively and reproducibly the performances of the systems that are designed.Operate the optimised quantum gravimeters and their network infrastructure and carriers to deliver scientific results beyond the state-of-the-art (including in terms of precision) for use cases in areas including, but not limited to, Earth observation, geodesy, oceanography, hydrology, volcano monitoring and civil engineering. They should demonstrate the added value of operating mounted gravimeters and terrestrial networks of gravimeters, if possible in combination (e.g. by analysing areas of interest sequentially).Provide a plan for the long-term operation of the infrastructure beyond the life of the project, involving other EU actors working in relevant areas, so that it is ready for integration into a multi-country initiative such as a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium. They should also provide an extensive review of use cases that can be addressed by quantum gravimeters for various configurations. Interoperability of the data for potential further reuse with European data ecosystem initiatives including, but not limited, to the Data Spaces (funded under the Digital Europe Programme), the European Open Science Cloud, and Destination Earth, should be duly taken into account, while respecting all applicable legislation and access and using rights distinguished between different user groups (government, cooperations, research institutes etc.) for the data generated. They should also demonstrate how other types of quantum sensors could be integrated into the infrastructure. The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of 36-48 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.Proposals should also cover synergies with other relevant European initiatives and programmes, including the Quantum Technologies Flagship and the planned development and deployment of a European space gravimetry infrastructure under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Open strategic autonomy in developing, deploying and using global space-based infrastructures, services, applications and data). In addition, they should contribute to spreading excellence across Europe; for example, through the involvement of Widening Countries.The intended users of the infrastructure built by the project and the services it offers are entities established in the eligible countries.In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 6 and achieve TRL 8 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO A, 'Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations.'KSO C, 'Making Europe the first digitally led circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact:Open strategic autonomy in digital technologies and in future emerging enabling technologies, by strengthening European capacities in key parts of digital and future supply chains, allowing agile responses to urgent needs, and by investing in early discovery and industrial uptake of new technologies. Electronic and photonic components, and the software that defines how they work, are the key digital technologies that underpin all digital systems. As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates, most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe's autonomy, particularly in periods of geopolitical instability, exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components, Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment, electric and autonomous vehicles, manufacturing and production plants and equipment, telecom networks, aerospace vehicles, consumer productsR&I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide, with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times, to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality ('Internet of Senses”). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.Despite a strong European scientific community's on AI and robotics, Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, transport, agriculture, energy, construction), providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.While Europe is strong in many sectors, it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness, prosperity and sustainability, by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies, e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches, use of biological elements as part of technology, and sustainable smart materials. In particular, the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet, but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118), in particular its 'secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures' pillar, actions under this Destination will support Europe's open strategic autonomy, and reinforce and regain European industry's leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene, and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions, which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI, Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore, promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.As a result, this Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:European Innovation Leadership in Photonics The European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments, far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications, and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'Photonics'.AI, Data and Robotics Europe has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research, Europe's scientific community is leading in AI and robotics, but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion, less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology, with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies, only capture 10% of full potential use, and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, many AI, Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore, there is room for improved adoption by industry, which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&I, from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general, industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies, but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, public sector, utilities, retail, finance, insurance, transport, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, construction, media, creative and cultural industries, fashion, tourism, etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.When it comes to Robotics, Europe is leading in its industry, with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics' cognition, safety, manipulation, soft robotics, underwater and aerial robotics, with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare, agri-food[[The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming, fisheries, horticulture etc., as well as produce processing, ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.]], forestry, inspection and maintenance, logistics, construction, manufacturing, etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial, marine, ground, in-vivo and space).The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies.Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.Open Source for Cloud/Edge and Software Engineering Fundamentals to support Digital Autonomy The European strategy for data (COM(2020) 66) aims at creating a single market that will ensure Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This calls for the ability to handle the entire data life-cycle which in turn relies on the underlying computing infrastructure (from the hardware to the software).In the light of dominant players, bridging established computing models (High Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, edge-computing and other emerging computing architectures) becomes a critical success factor for enabling a computing continuum. Open computing architectures at many levels based on Open approaches spanning both software/hardware is thus a pre-requisite for Digital autonomy - notably when it comes to Cloud infrastructures where European players are falling short.Actions under this heading will thus support the next steps of development and adoption of Open technologies on different levels while fostering progress on responsible software engineering fundamentals.European leadership in Emerging and Enabling Technologies Europe's leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement, but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged, with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech, though, this intertwining is essential.The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe's future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm Shift Since 2018, the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe's scientific leadership and excellence in quantum, in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU's aims for quantum R&I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship's Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators, which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship, by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing, simulation, sensing and communication, in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership, capitalising on Europe's established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.The aim of the Commission's Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world, and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty, as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used, among others, for sensitive applications in the area of security, and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context, the EU must take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets, interests, autonomy and security, while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators, that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025, with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact, with applications in medicine, manufacturing, or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography, finance and many other sensitive domains.Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU's interests, as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications, sensors for autonomous vehicles, and the next generation of medical sensors.It is therefore clearly in the EU's interests to protect European research in these domains, the intellectual property that it generates, and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result, while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe's strategic dependencies). With this in mind, the Commission has decided that, in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation, communication, and sensing, only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.Graphene: Europe in the lead The starting point is the Graphene Flagship, launched in 2013, which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation, automotive, electronics, batteries, healthcare).The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes.Expected impactProposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Europe's open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI, data, robotics, quantum computing, and graphene, and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms. Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

HORIZON-CL4-2024-HUMAN-03-02,Explainable and Robust AI (AI Data and Robotics Partnership) (RIA),HORIZON-RIA HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions,HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-23T00:00:00,2024-09-18T17:00:00,,7500000,7500000,2,46950906,46950745HORIZONResearchandInnovationActions1713830400000,"ExpectedOutcome:Projects are expected to contribute to one of the following outcomes:Enhanced robustness, performance and reliability of AI systems, including generative AI models, with awareness of the limits of operational robustness of the system.Improved explainability and accountability, transparency and autonomy of AI systems, including generative AI models, along with an awareness of the working conditions of the system. Scope:Trustworthy AI solutions, need to be robust, safe and reliable when operating in real-world conditions, and need to be able to provide adequate, meaningful and complete explanations when relevant, or insights into causality, account for concerns about fairness, be robust when dealing with such issues in real world conditions, while aligned with rights and obligations around the use of AI systems in Europe. Advances across these areas can help create human-centric AI[1], which reflects the needs and values of European citizens and contribute to an effective governance of AI technologies.The need for transparent and robust AI systems has become more pressing with the rapid growth and commercialisation of generative AI systems based on foundation models. Despite their impressive capabilities, trustworthiness remains an unresolved, fundamental scientific challenge. Due to the intricate nature of generative AI systems, understanding or explaining the rationale behind their outputs is normally not possible with current explainable AI methods. Moreover, these models occasionally tend to 'hallucinate', generating non-factual or inaccurate information, further compromising their reliability.To achieve robust and reliable AI, novel approaches are needed to develop methods and solutions that work under other than model-ideal circumstances, while also having an awareness when these conditions break down. To achieve trustworthiness, AI system should be sufficiently transparent and capable of explaining how the system has reached a conclusion in a way that it is meaningful to the user, enabling safe and secure human-machine interaction, while also indicating when the limits of operation have been reached.The purpose is to advance AI-algorithms and innovations based on them that can perform safely under a common variety of circumstances, reliably in real-world conditions and predict when these operational circumstances are no longer valid. The research should aim at advancing robustness and explainability for a generality of solutions, while leading to an acceptable loss in accuracy and efficiency, and with known verifiability and reproducibility. The focus is on extending the general applicability of explainability and robustness of AI-systems by foundational AI and machine learning research. To this end, the following methods may be considered but are not necessarily restricted to:data-efficient learning, transformers and alternative architectures, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning of foundation models, reinforcement learning, federated and edge-learning, automated machine learning, or any combination thereof for improved robustness and explainability.hybrid approaches integrating learning, knowledge and reasoning, neurosymbolic methods, model-based approaches, neuromorphic computing, or other nature-inspired approaches and other forms of hybrid combinations which are generically applicable to robustness and explainability.continual learning, active learning, long-term learning and how they can help improve robustness and explainability.multi-modal learning, natural language processing, speech recognition and text understanding taking multicultural aspects into account for the purpose of increased operational robustness and the capability to explain alternative formulation[2]. Multidisciplinary research activities should address all of the following:Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in all the relevant sector specific use cases and disciplines, and where appropriate Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), including gender and intersectional knowledge to address concerns around gender, racial or other biases, etc.Proposals are expected to dedicate tasks and resources to collaborate with and provide input to the open innovation challenge under HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-04 addressing explainability and robustness. Research teams involved in the proposals are expected to participate in the respective Innovation Challenges.Contribute to making AI and robotics solutions meet the requirements of Trustworthy AI, based on the respect of the ethical principles, the fundamental rights including critical aspects such as robustness, safety, reliability, in line with the European Approach to AI. Ethics principles needs to be adopted from early stages of development and design. All proposals are expected to embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring), and share communicable results with the European R&D community, through the AI-on-demand platform or Digital Industrial Platform for Robotics, public community resources, to maximise re-use of results, either by developers, or for uptake, and optimise efficiency of funding; enhancing the European AI, Data and Robotics ecosystem and possible sector-specific forums through the sharing of results and best practice.In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Canada and India. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to start at TRL 2-3 and achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project - see General Annex B. [1]A European approach to artificial intelligence | Shaping Europe's digital future (europa.eu)[2]Research should complement build upon and collaborate with projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-03: Natural Language Understanding and Interaction in Advanced Language Technologies",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation. As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions, workers, regions, and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations, and will be differently affected by these changes, creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development, but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027). Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes. The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:Leadership in AI based on trust The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.EIT Digital plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ​An Internet of Trust The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.eXtended Reality (XR) Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and conditionThe objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry. This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade”), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.European standards for industrial competitiveness The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.International cooperation The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation.

Scope:This action will contribute to the objectives spelled out in the EU Standardisation Strategy and meeting the objectives of the European Green Deal and Europe's Digital Decade, in particular to supporting the EU's leading position in global standards-setting as a forerunner in key technologies and promoting EU core values, by supporting and empowering the participation of European stakeholders in the development of open technical specifications and standards with the aim to strengthen European competitiveness and sovereignty, promoting EU values and ethics, and strengthen the take-up, scalability and cross-sector interoperability of their technological solutions. This action will among the others support the Commission's effort to address the critical issues related to internet, trusted and secured chips, or data standards as described in the EU Standardisation Strategy.The aim is to reinforce the presence of EU and associated states experts in the global ICT standardisation scene, by setting up an ICT standardisation observatory and a facility supporting the participation of key European specialists (especially from SMEs, societal stakeholders and Academia) in key international and global Standard Developing Organisations[1]. In particular, the project should foresee actions related to topics in the Rolling Plan for ICT standardisation as well as related to internet standardisation.The action will also contribute to the objective of promoting EU cutting-edge innovation that fosters timely standards, by coordinating with other EU funded projects and action that may contribute with their results to ICT standardisation, as well as with EU supported PPPs and Joint Undertakings, seeking for synergies.To achieve these objectives, proposals under this topic should provide for:Landscape and gap analysis of international ICT standardisation, including identification of sectors and areas, in particular within the field of internet standardisation, quantum network, IoT, 6G mobile communication, data, edge computing, artificial intelligence, eGovernment, block chain / DLT, cyber security, smart cities & communities, data centres, trusted chips, robotics, circular economy certification etc.Setting up of a management facility to support contributions and leadership (e.g. chairing of technical committees, convenor positions) of European specialists (incl. from SMEs and academia) in activities in relation to international standardisation including in global ICT SDOs, fora and consortia.When relevant, support financially the hosting standardisation meetings and workshops in Europe to ease the participation of European experts;Facilitation of a foresight committee, which liaises with relevant on-going developments in EU and national Member States funded R&I projects, in particular with projects having identified standardisation outputs or with potential relevant results to contribute to standardisation, including as well other coordination and support actions, and relevant European Partnerships;Promotion of the relevance and benefits of ICT standardisation, especially for European industry competitiveness, driving sustainability, sovereignty, supporting objectives of the European green deal and EU values and ethics.

[1]Such us ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC JTC1, ITU-T, 3GPP, IETF, OneM2M, W3C, OASIS, IEEE",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation. As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions, workers, regions, and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations, and will be differently affected by these changes, creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development, but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027). Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes. The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:Leadership in AI based on trust The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.EIT Digital plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ​An Internet of Trust The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.eXtended Reality (XR) Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and conditionThe objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry. This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade”), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.European standards for industrial competitiveness The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.International cooperation The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment). It will also contribute to the overarching objectives of our continental partnership in full alignment with the principles of the Global Gateway.Cooperation with Latin America will aim at exploiting the potential of the newly established BELLA network and implement the outcomes of EU-LAC dialogues in the context of digitalisation and R&I.Additionally, international collaboration is encouraged or targeted in several thematic areas may also be addressed within the respective Joint Undertakings (Smart Networks and Services, EuroHPC, and Key Digital Technologies).Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Scope:MSCA Doctoral Networks will implement doctoral programmes, by partnerships of universities, research institutions and research infrastructures, businesses including SMEs, and other socio-economic actors from different countries across Europe and beyond. MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS[1] website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee's taxes and contributions) should be published.MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.Industrial DoctoratesThrough Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.Joint DoctoratesJoint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees[2] recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.Supervisory BoardEach MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.Training activitiesMSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training[3]. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).SupervisionParticular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.Career Development PlanA Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens. The plan, established at the beginning of the recruitment, should be revised (and updated where needed) within 18 months.

Innovations developed under this action should be designed to enable rapid scale-up of Union pharmaceutical production in the context of a health emergency or to prevent critical shortages of critical medicines. This action supports the Union's pharmaceutical industry to be better able to respond to public health needs in the context of health emergencies and critical medicines shortages.It does so by enabling the development of tools that contribute to the improvement and optimisation of manufacturing of medicines, with the objective of reducing production costs (e.g., related to labour and energy consumption), and facilitating compliance with the Union's environmental occupational and social requirements, as well as the Union's current and future needs to scale-up pharmaceutical production. This action supports the policy priority to enhance crisis preparedness and response for future health emergencies in relation to medical countermeasures with an all-threats approach, as well as preventing critical shortages of critical medicines, especially those in a situation of technological vulnerability with regards to the EU market. It implements the EU4Health Programme's general objective of improving the availability, accessibility and affordability of crisis-relevant products (Article 3, point (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.

EU4H-2024-PJ-01-4,Call for proposals to support the development of novel antivirals (HERA) - CP-g-24-105,EU4H-PJG EU4H Project Grants,EU4H Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-05-23T00:00:00,2024-09-05T17:00:00,,10000000,10000000,,46932879,46932873EU4HProjectGrants1716422400000,"Objective:This action supports the policy priority to be better prepared to respond to serious cross-border health threats. It contributes to the achievement of the EU4Health Programme's general objective of protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination among the Member States to cope with serious cross-border threats to health (Article 3, point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522. Scope:This action aims to diversify and advance the pipeline of BSA candidates. More specifically, it will support the development and further characterisation of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting identified HERA priority viral families, which largely can be divided among respiratory RNA viral families, such as Paramyxo-, Orthomyxo and Coronaviridae, as well as those targeting viral families known for causing viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), such as Arena-, Bunya-, Flavi-, Filoviridae. The action aims to identify a potent BSA candidate, in order to advance its clinical development. A robust pipeline should contain multiple BSA candidates for each viral family that are developed in parallel. When selecting the BSA candidate, attention will be paid to the complementarity with existing Horizon Europe projects.The proposal would need to cover early safety and efficacy trials for testing new or improved anti-viral therapeutics, with a clear regulatory and clinical pathway, including first in humans.Innovative delivery systems and suitable safety profiles for broad use should be considered when possible as well as the application of novel approaches and widely applicable workflows (e.g. artificial intelligence) for rapid and reliable identification of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapeutics. Expected Impact:HERA's threat assessment of 2022 included a vulnerability analysis with regard to the availability or absence of medical countermeasures, in particular the availability of vaccines and treatment options. Given that the large majority of identified virus families lack effective vaccines and/or effective therapeutics at the EU and global levels, HERA's long-term aim is to, inter alia, support the creation of a diverse portfolio of BSAs and BCCs that can be further developed in clinical by identifying most promising candidates and supporting their characterisation and assessment, including through clinical trials. Actions funded under this topic are therefore expected to either bring innovative, emerging, and cutting-edge elements with significant economic potential to the internal market or to reduce or prevent strategic dependencies of the Union, including by contributing to the Union's technological leadership in the innovation and development of BSA and enhancing the access to these products in the EU.",,,,,
EU4H-2024-PJ-01-2,Call for proposals for next-generation respiratory protection (HERA) - CP-g-24-11,EU4H-PJG EU4H Project Grants,EU4H Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-05-23T00:00:00,2024-09-05T17:00:00,,20000000,20000000,,46932879,46932863EU4HProjectGrants1716422400000,"Objective:Through this action, HERA will support the development of next-generation respiratory PPE that addresses and/or mitigates the above-mentioned issues (see section 1.2), ending a 30-year period of no significant innovation in the field and ultimately ensuring a more effective response to future cross-border health threats, with an all-threats approach. In this context, it implements the EU4Health general objective of improving the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicinal products and medical devices, and crisis-relevant products in the Union, and supports the innovation of such products (Article 3, point (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.The objective of this action is to foster innovation and support the development of next-generation respiratory PPE that overcomes the limitations outlined above and result in increased availability of enhanced medical countermeasures for pandemic preparedness and response. Scope:Applicants might develop completely new technologies or rely on reformulated designs and novel applications of existing materials and technologies. Applicants need to propose a detailed plan to design, prototype, validate, and CE-mark innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable next-generation respirators. To overcome the limitations outlined above, they need to offer higher levels of protection than FFP2 respirators while being universally fitting, enabling comfortable multi-hour use.Different solutions may target different populations (e.g., clinicians, critical workers, the public, etc.). Proposals should include a dissemination and market readiness plan that ensures a market for the product in preparedness times - e.g., through stockpiling or active use. This plan should generate sufficient demand to set up production.Importantly, developers also need to demonstrate feasibility for a rapid production scale-up once a public health emergency materialises, possibly relying on distributed manufacturing solutions and use of accessible raw materials. Products should demonstrate the potential to be at a cost that will allow for a switch from the currently used PPE. To encourage sustainability, products should be reusable, less harmful to the environment and ideally foster environmentally friendly production. Proposals need to take into consideration that next generation respiratory devices should be easy to store (e.g., occupying minimum space in stockpiles and having long expiry dates) and simple to use by the target population. Expected Impact:This action will support bringing next-generation PPE to the market to provide sustainable, universal and effective choices for the personal protection of healthcare and other essential workers, patients and the public. Superior respiratory protection will be available for stockpiling, scale-up and uptake by healthcare systems and the public in response to future pandemics or epidemics. The reduction of the use of single-use products will make the EU less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.Cost-effective and user-friendly next-generation respirators will slowly replace regular respirators and be deployed at national, regional, and local levels, ensuring better preparedness for future pandemics and other cross-border health threats. Widely incorporating improved respirators into clinical practice will also lead to better protection for healthcare workers and patients already in preparedness times, and overall improved health outcomes.",,,,,

Scope:Scope: The nuclear and radiation protection sector demands a consistently high level of diverse skills[1], and is experiencing challenges to attract the younger generation. Possible gaps in human resources and skills could become critical when considering the importance of the sector in EU Member States.In this context, the Commission is offering funding through a coordination and support action for a long-term, industry-, research- and training-led public & private initiative to maintain and further develop the skills necessary to ensure the availability of high-level expertise for the safe use of current and future nuclear technologies in the EU. This initiative will prepare a strategy to identify and quantify nuclear skills shortages across the EU, drawing on approaches from different industries (such as the MATCH programme[2]), the European Human Resources Observatory for the Nuclear Sector (EHRO-N) and Member States, in particular building upon the work already initiated in job taxonomy and national workforce assessments under EHRO-N.Overall, the proposed strategy should contribute to maintaining the highest levels of nuclear safety and radiation protection. Achieving this objective requires the strategy to also cover aspects relevant to the recently established SMR Industrial Alliance. The initiative's strategy and multi-annual action plan should consider increasing (i) activities across sectors and Member States, (ii) collaboration and transnational mobility and (iii) vocational training programmes and should identify the reskilling and upskilling needs of job holders in the sector (identification, validation and certification of skills), including access to nuclear research facilities.Additionally, the strategy should identify ways to promote nuclear and radiation protection careers and job paths among young people and with teachers, instructors and professors. At the same time it should improve diversity, inclusion and gender representation in the nuclear sector (fission and fusion), including by sustaining in its current form the existing European Masters in the nuclear and engineering field (i.e. organised and delivered by academics in at least three Member States).The proposed project will benefit from past and current education and training efforts under various programmes and instruments (cf. Euratom Research and Training Programme, Erasmus+, EIT, Instrument for Nuclear Safety, Pact for Skills[3], SAMIRA Action Plan[4]), carried out by national service providers, the JRC and the European Nuclear Education Network (ENEN). It will also draw on best practice from various industries and countries.The consortium will involve a wide variety of stakeholders, from industry, research and training organisations, as well as academia, regulatory bodies and professionals from the fields of education and human resources management.The initiative should leverage existing EU instruments where appropriate, including the Pact for Skills. The feasibility of the proposed strategy should be demonstrated by a pilot action implemented by the consortium during the lifetime of the project.

Nevertheless, several socio-economic barriers impede the deployment of solutions aimed at facilitating such transition.Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:overcoming barriers to the uptake of new knowledge and innovation for the green transition under the sectors covered by Cluster 6 and propose credible pathways towards addressing these barriers;improved adoption of tools, methods and options by actors along value chains as well as decision makers, including local and regional authorities, to overcome the identified barriers and support the deployment of innovative solutions that facilitate the green transition. Scope:Under this topic, proposals should seek to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges related to barriers towards the green transition and propose creative or disruptive solutions to overcome them that are not covered by the other topics of Horizon Europe Cluster 6 calls in Work Programmes 2021-2022 and 2023-2024.Proposals funded under this topic should:identify barriers to the uptake by end users of new knowledge and innovation for the green transition on aspects of water resilience, circular economy, biodiversity, zero pollution, and climate change;address factors (socio-economic, cultural, etc.) that differ across the EU and play a fundamental role in determining the acceptance of technological and social innovation solutions designed to foster the green transition;develop solutions to overcome identified barriers, including by taking advantage of technological and digital tools as well as innovative dissemination strategies, organisational models and educational activities. The involvement of actors as appropriate, based on the elements of the multi-actor approach, is encouraged. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and options. Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps after the research project.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.",,"Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing carbon sinks in primary production and natural systems as well as in harvested wood products and other carbon storage products are key components of the European Green Deal[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN]]. Achieving sustainable ocean, water and land management, and using natural resources efficiently to help mitigate climate change implies finding the right balance between productivity, climate, biodiversity and environmental goals in the agriculture and forestry sectors, with a long-term perspective. R&I activities will support solutions for climate and environmentally friendly practices to reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases, other pollutants and the environmental impact of ocean and land use changes and agricultural activities. R&I will rely on the application of digital technologies where relevant.The EU climate law[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&from=EN]] states that to reach 2030 and 2050 climate targets and to restore biodiversity, the EU needs to immediately and decisively restore and increase its natural carbon sinks. In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a communication on sustainable carbon cycles, including carbon farming and certification of carbon removals[[https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf]]. R&I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will help coordinate the research community and key stakeholders in developing, testing and demonstrating carbon farming practices and in certifying carbon removals. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&I on manure management will help implement the EU methane strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf]]. R&I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest as a natural and man-made carbon sink and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the Fit for 55 package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new EU forest strategy.Strengthening the nexus between the ocean and climate change is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture. Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the ocean and climate change.Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the EU Arctic policy; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on sustainable blue economy and its offshoot initiatives as well as implementing the Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives; and iii) helping to achieve the clean planet for all's aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.In line with the climate adaptation strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.In the area of forestry, R&I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.R&I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[ This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].Expected impactsProposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to climate action on land - including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;advancement of science and technology to support the adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;increased climate change mitigation in the primary sectors, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining natural and man-made carbon sinks and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;improved capacity to climate change of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;sustainable management of scarce resources, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.

Scope:The Commission aims to support and incentivise the European fusion community and industry and to act decisively to strengthen and deploy the EU's technological leadership and expertise in this field. This will ensure the EU's strategic autonomy and competitiveness for the future commercial deployment of fusion energy.The EU has a world-leading industrial capability in mainstream magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). The know-how in the construction and assembly of tokamaks and stellarators has primarily been developed through involvement in ITER and other publicly funded devices either via F4E or EUROfusion.However, large-size EU industries have been mainly involved as suppliers rather than R&D partners. There is also a significant risk that the engineering fusion know-how and industrial potential could be lost and migrate to other countries with a more favourable economic and regulatory landscape.In this context, the Commission aims to engage the EU fusion industry to tackle the critical bottlenecks that need to be addressed to design a first viable and cost-effective fusion power plant. This will ensure that EU industry masters and exploits the relevant technologies and consolidates the range of components and processes needed to establish a competitive EU value supply chain, also in connection to the completion of ITER construction and its operation. At the same time, in addition to the current mainstream MCF approach, the Commission intends to support innovation in alternative fusion concepts and in the development of key enabling technologies to address specific technical and industrial challenges.Fusion is one of the most ambitious engineering feats and will require the integration of knowledge and expertise from several different fields and stakeholders. Neither the public nor the private sector acting alone will be able to successfully tackle this challenge. For this reason, it is necessary to create a new collaborative environment in the form of a PPP.This action will provide key support to a representative stakeholder consortium. This consortium will act as a single-entry point managing activities towards the development of a potential future PPP. The action will, in particular:identify and create, in an inclusive manner, a stakeholder network bringing together industry (including supply chain, startups, energy providers and investors), technology centres, academia and research organisations (including EUROfusion and the Joint Undertaking 'Fusion for Energy');support the creation of an organisation (entity with legal personality) which is expected to become the lead organisation in the potential future PPP;put in place the legal and financial arrangements required to ensure the sustainability of this organisation beyond the duration of this action and throughout the duration of the PPP, with a view to the organisation possibly evolving into a long-term European Technology and Innovation Platform in the field of fusion, integrating wider R&I efforts across the EU;define a suitable governance structure for the PPP in the form of a co-programmed European partnership;develop a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Fusion Energy in coordination with the Commission, industry and the EU fusion community;coordinate and leverage commitments, expected in the form of in-kind contributions, from the private partners;undertake preparatory work for the possible establishment of a separate trade association representing the EU fusion industry. Among the objectives mentioned above, priority should be given to those required to launch the PPP within the period covered by the extension of the Euratom Research and Training Programme (2026-2027), subject to the Council's adoption of a Regulation on this extension.The duration of the action is expected to be 2 years.",,,,,

They should target the realization of initial tape-outs of at least 7nm. within the timeframe of the first RIA. The node selection should be done based on a thorough cost/benefit analysis and corresponding industrial and market perspectives. Moreover, the consortium should indicate the advantages and disadvantages of using the target fabrication processes, assess the availability of relevant IP, availability of design tools, licenses, and also their resources and capabilities. The required EDA tools and IP should be described in detail and the timeline of the obtained licenses and cost should be detailed. EDA training requirements, availability, and experience of relevant engineering resources, etc should be taken into account.RTL-freeze should be targeted for month 18. At this point, before moving to tape-out, the EuroHPC JU will assess the KPI[1] achievements/projections including a competitive assessment with regards to non-EU solutions worldwide for each hardware development activity and decide whether a particular technological development should be continued or halted. A single mask-set for all chiplets should be considered to reduce tape-out costs. A detailed plan to synchronise the chiplets resulting from the hardware developments should be provided and a private shuttle with a single mask set should be preferably created.Applications and Software Technical Area:Develop an optimised HPC software stack for the hardware development technical areas. The software stack should support single nodes as well as large configurations.Develop a hardware-software co-design simulation framework to facilitate native hardware support to application requirements.Port at least 3 realistic applications to the new hardware platforms. The selection of applications should be justified in detail with respect to coverage of projected future HPC workloads.

In the case of a consortium, it must be composed of any legal entity (public or private bodies) established in one of the call eligible countries. In the case of a single applicant, it could be any legal entity (public or private bodies) established in one of the call eligible countries. In both cases, a mandatory support letter demonstrating a public authority's interest in the proposed solution. The public authority must play a relevant role in the field of the project and/or in the scope of the proposed community or solution.This Strand is looking to incorporate new Smart Communities into AURORAL. For example:An existing Smart Community adapts their services to use the AURORAL middleware as a means of communication and extends their existing solutionsA community starts using AURORAL supplied services to demonstrate the replicability of our solution and improves or expands themA community implements or develops a new service to become smarter and to solve a specific problem utilizing the AURORAL middleware (like in the above example with AI optimized fertilization for Smart Farming)It is mandatory that the open call project validates and uses the AURORAL middleware in areas beyond the existing project pilots. In case an existing pilot is replicated it is important that the AURORAL ecosystem is expanded with new services and solutions.Here are some more specific examples to also explain the consortium composition: A local aerial infrared imaging company creates a consortium with a forest and tree health monitoring company. The imaging company offers local infrared imagery of forests via the AURORAL middleware. The tree health monitoring company uses the middleware to obtain this data and analyzes it for the overall health of the forest and for pests. Additionally, they have a letter of support from a municipality to use their forests as a test pilot within the project.A municipality wants to create an energy community/ies for their citizens. They form a consortium together with a local SME. The municipality advertises the project to their citizens and helps with the contractual work. The SME installs smart meters or adapts existing measuring solutions to connect with the AURORAL middleware. The SME handles the setup of energy community services provided by AURORAL and extends the AURORAL ecosystem with their own existing or newly developed service(s). A local media company has a great idea on how to distribute the municipalities provided information and how to improve the involvement of citizens with the government. They form a consortium with a municipality. The municipality adapts several of their existing data sources and services to the AURORAL middleware. The media company uses AURORAL to receive and use all of this data and services to provide their novel citizen application.Strand B: Call for new complementary services - max grant amount: € 55.200This Strand is intended for single applicants, being any legal entity, like small to medium sized enterprises (SME), universities, research centers, associations, etc. We want to see new services brought to AURORAL. For example:An existing service is adapted to the AURORAL middleware and extended with new functionality A new AURORAL enabled services is developedProvided services must benefit Smart Communities in one of the following areas: Health, Mobility, Farming, Energy, Tourism, Media, Education, Governance, Industry, Territory, and Nature.Already within AURORAL existing pilots or data might be used. Otherwise the service shall be demonstrated in a real or controlled environment.A few examples for such services are: An AI service to optimize crop fertilization/yield Sensor based fault prediction for manufacturing machines Innovative ways of educating people about an important topic like sustainability or Smart Communities A mobility solution for citizens and tourists A platform for sharing goods/resources Services to improve data quality or to detect data bias Services to create and run machine learning models by using data from AURORAL A new and smart way to better incorporate citizens in governmental decision processesPlease keep in mind that your service might look completely different, since the area around Smart Communities is very wide. Further it is mandatory that the service(s) add new functionality to AURORAL and do not offer 100% of the same functionality provided by already existing services. It is also possible to connect/built on top of existing AURORAL services and to extend their functionality.EVALUATION:External experts will carry out evaluation. They will be appointed by the AURORAL consortium through a call for expression of interest among relevant experts (to apply as an expert, see www.auroral.eu).Evaluation criteria will cover Excellence, Impact and Implementation.To be eligible, the applicants (lead applicants, co-applicants, and affiliated entities) must be:A legal entity eligible for submitting proposals under the H2020 funding programme;Established in any of the following countries:The Member States (MS) of the European Union (EU), including their outermost regions.The Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) linked to the Member States.Entities from OCTs are eligible for funding under the same conditions as entities from the Member States to which the OCT in question is linked.H2020 Associated countries: according to the updated list published by the EC) and the Widening Countries.",https://www.auroral.eu/#/open-calls,"6 Months, the project can start after approval and must end by the end of February 2025"

Accordingly, projects under this priority are intended to raise the fundamental rights knowledge of relevant actors. Building on the central role of civil society organisations and human rights defenders, funded projects could involve national, regional and local authorities as partners (co-applicants), with the aim of supporting joint capacity building and awareness raising efforts.The projects funded under this priority could address the capacity building and awareness raising needs on the Charter in general, or they could focus on one or several of the topics below:• Rights enshrined in the Charter and awareness of the Charter's scope of application. In accordance with its Article 51, the Charter is applicable to Member States only when they are implementing EU law. Given the specific scope of application of this instrument, unlike that of international human rights agreements, and considering the increasing number of references to the Charter in the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU, there is a specific need to promote an understanding of when the Charter applies, i.e. when EU law is being implemented, and of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter. Relevant projects could therefore focus on the scope of application of the Charter and/or on the contents of an individual Charter right and/or several rights.• Protecting fundamental rights in the digital age. To follow up on the Annual Charter Report 2021 on fundamental rights in the digital age, the aim of the priority is to protect fundamental rights by strengthening accountability for the use of automation where rights are at stake. This includes approaches for addressing and combatting bias and multiple/intersectional discrimination based on gender and on other grounds including ethnic and racial origin, caused or intensified by the use of artificial intelligence systems. Projects could aim to develop guidelines (including measures that ensure gender sensitive implementation), technical benchmarks and tools, including for algorithm-audits. Projects are expected to develop a concrete tool or a benchmark process in an area of the applicant's choice with demonstrated relevance for fundamental rights, without prescribing the area or the type of the tool (e.g. it could be software, a benchmark data set, a simulation environment, a procedure).",,,,,

Scope:Actions should aim at developing innovative approaches to:improve the monitoring, understanding, reporting and projections of essential biogeochemical oceanic processes related to climate and changes over time at regional or sea basin scale (oxygen, nutrients, inorganic carbon, transient tracers, nitrous oxide, ocean colour, particulate matter, dissolved organic carbon, elemental and isotopic tracers, stable carbon isotopes, marine debris); integrate multidisciplinary observation systems (in-situ, airborne, satellite) and improved models;inform models and improve predictions of the Earth system response to ocean acidification and to the ocean biological pump, including the long-term trends in ocean chemistry, beyond the observational record (paleo-ocean acidification), for a better understanding of the multi-decadal reversibility or the hysteresis of ocean processes (like the AMOC). Links should be made with ocean stratification that acts as barrier for water mixing or carbon sequestration;support the development of the ocean component of climate models through a better representation of essential biogeochemical processes, microbe biomass and diversity and enable a better understanding of the links between ocean physical and biogeochemical variability and ocean stratification; the action should contribute to the integration of more biogeochemical parameters, assimilation techniques, models and assessment strategies into ESMs;combine GHG measurements in regions especially critical for GHG fluxes with relevant biogeochemical measurements (e.g., oxygen, nutrients, carbon) to support GHG data analyses and model simulations to improve the understanding of ocean biogeochemical fluxes and turnover of carbon and nitrogen and the quantification of fluxes between basins/regimes and across interfaces (air-sea, water-sediment); focus should be on quantifying GHG reservoir size and change, and potential subsequent impact on GHG fluxes, ocean productivity, ocean acidification, carbon sequestration, oxygen demand and carbonate system. The action should also address the interplay between carbonate chemistry and a variety of biogeochemical and physical processes, including eutrophication and freshwater inflow and outflow in coastal zones. The action should further research the net response of natural ocean CH4 and N2O sources to future warming, including permafrost, and predict the magnitude and timing of the responses of each individual process.Where appropriate, the combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal and/or environmental risk should be assessed. Actions should identify safe operating spaces for the ocean to provide life-support systems for humanity and the planetary ecosystems, accompanied - where relevant - with long-term strategies for preventing or mitigating impacts. The assessments of cumulative effects should look at existing and past activities in the marine environment but should also allow for foresight in order to inform planning of future activities and support management that is adaptive to future conditions and sustains ecosystems and human well-being.The action funded under this topic should establish a strong collaboration with the projects funded under HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-8, namely ObsSea4Clim (covering physical EOVs) and BioEcoOcean (covering biological EOVs), in order to ensure delivering the necessary integration of EOVs and help characterize the interplay and dependence between the biological, chemical, and physical properties of the ocean.International cooperation will be essential in integrating and coordinating these different scaled approaches. A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance, the UN Decade of Ocean Science, GOOS, the Copernicus marine service, GOOS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), MBON of GEOBON, ICOS, GCOS, and other relevant international Ocean Observing Initiatives. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS, and EMODnet).This topic is part of a coordination initiative between the European Space Agency and the European Commission on Earth System Science. Under the initiative, both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementarities between the Horizon Europe and the European Space Agency FutureEO programmes, and their projects. Proposals under this topic should address networking and collaborative research activities with relevant European Space Agency actions. In particular, the European Space Agency will contribute to this topic with existing and planned projects focused on enhancing the observation capacity and understanding from satellite EO technology of the relevant ocean processes[1]. Proposals should address the collaboration with ongoing or future ESA projects, including those that will be funded through dedicated coordinated invitations to tender, and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination. Applicants are encouraged to contact ESA to organise the joint European Commission-European Space Agency work.Collaboration with the relevant existing European Research Infrastructures and European Open Science Cloud projects is encouraged.Synergies and complementarities should be sought with projects under HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-8: Closing the research gaps on Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) in support of global assessments, HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-6: Ocean models for seasonal to decadal and local to regional climate predictions, and Cluster 5 topics: HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-02: Inland ice, including snow cover, glaciers, ice sheets and permafrost, and their interaction with climate change, HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-01: Enhanced quantification and understanding of natural and anthropogenic methane emissions and sinks, and HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-02: Climate-related tipping points. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7-8 by the end of the project - see General Annex B. [1] Dedicated ESA invitation to tenders to be launched in 2023 and 2024 for each of the clusters will be published in the ESA-STAR Tender publication system (https://esastar-publication-ext.sso.esa.int).",,"Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing carbon sinks in primary production and natural systems as well as in harvested wood products and other carbon storage products are key components of the European Green Deal[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2019%3A640%3AFIN]]. Achieving sustainable ocean, water and land management, and using natural resources efficiently to help mitigate climate change implies finding the right balance between productivity, climate, biodiversity and environmental goals in the agriculture and forestry sectors, with a long-term perspective. R&I activities will support solutions for climate and environmentally friendly practices to reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases, other pollutants and the environmental impact of ocean and land use changes and agricultural activities. R&I will rely on the application of digital technologies where relevant.The EU climate law[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&from=EN]] states that to reach 2030 and 2050 climate targets and to restore biodiversity, the EU needs to immediately and decisively restore and increase its natural carbon sinks. In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a communication on sustainable carbon cycles, including carbon farming and certification of carbon removals[[https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf]]. R&I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will help coordinate the research community and key stakeholders in developing, testing and demonstrating carbon farming practices and in certifying carbon removals. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&I on manure management will help implement the EU methane strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf]]. R&I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest as a natural and man-made carbon sink and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the Fit for 55 package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new EU forest strategy.Strengthening the nexus between the ocean and climate change is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture. Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the ocean and climate change.Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the EU Arctic policy; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on sustainable blue economy and its offshoot initiatives as well as implementing the Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives; and iii) helping to achieve the clean planet for all's aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.In line with the climate adaptation strategy[[ https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.In the area of forestry, R&I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.R&I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[ This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].Expected impactsProposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to climate action on land - including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;advancement of science and technology to support the adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;increased climate change mitigation in the primary sectors, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining natural and man-made carbon sinks and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;improved capacity to climate change of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;sustainable management of scarce resources, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.

Important decisions that shaped how the internet works today were made in the distant past, and we continue to run into the consequences — cascading effects and limited resilience, scalability issues, lack of strong privacy and security and a blind spot for energy efficiency. These may have seemed less important at the time, but currently they certainly are not, and we need to act.We want a more resilient, trustworthy and open internet. We want to empower end-users. Given the speed at which the 'twin transition' is taking place, we need a greener internet and more sustainable services sooner rather than later. Neither will happen at global scale without protocol evolution, which — as the case of three decades of IPv6 introduction demonstrates — is extremely challenging. NGI0 Core is designed to push beyond the status quo and create a virtuous cycle of innovation through free and open source software, libre hardware and open standards. If we want everyone to use and benefit from the internet to its full potential without holding back, the internet must be built on strong and transparent technologies that allow for permissionless innovation and are equally accessible to all.We work towards better technologies to restore and maintain European sovereignty and to secure democratic ownership of the digital society. NGI Zero actively works towards digital commons and trustworthy technological building blocks for the next generation of the internet. The goal is to help set the course of the evolution of technology, provide people with concrete new tools and more reliable infrastructure, which provides better overall security and allow them more agency and choice.NGI0 Core is designed to help reshape the state of play, and to help create an open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all. This includes developing alternatives and improvements to core web and internet hardware, software and protocols removes gatekeepers, choke points and surveillance capabilities. But also tackling issues of security, privacy, interoperability, high availability and scalability of decentralised technologies to allow us to benefit from both 'local first' and from economies of scale without unnecessary centralisation. Other examples include mobile operating systems, encryption tools, videoconferencing services, open social media, open source large language models and portable/pluggable AI, virtual/enhanced/augmented reality and multimodal user interaction.NGI0 Core supports independent researchers and developers working on digital commons in order to restore and maintain European sovereignty, and to secure democratic ownership of the digital society. NGI Zero Entrust aims to enable and assist independent researchers and developers to create powerful new technology that benefit end users, and to help them put it in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society and an open economy that benefits all.We are looking for troubleshooters that help society tackle the ossification of the internet and other hard but very very important challenges, each of which has significant social and economic consequences. We need new ideas and disruptive core technologies, while at the same time evolving and growing existing technologies that are still enough future-proof. The project results become available under an open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code to create technology that fits their own purposes. The right to reuse and right to repair not only allow for unrestricted scrutiny and permissionless innovation, but also help to reduce e-waste.

The scope of the Data Space for Smart Communities includes alignment with the overall '2030 Digital Decade'' EU policy initiative and related specific legislative initiatives, such as the Interoperable Europe Act. It is one of the Common European Data Spaces envisioned by the EU Data Strategy and works closely with the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC), especially on cross-sectorial aspects such as minimal interoperability. The pilots will provide feedback from practice as more firm guidance is put into regulatory instruments, such as requirements for procurement, operation, and reporting, starting from a baseline of high-value datasets to add value by using data from different domains and models. This initiative aims to foster innovation towards a more resilient Europe, supporting local businesses and ecosystems, and emphasising ethical considerations and AI-enabled local solutions, thereby enhancing the conditions for citizens and communities across Europe.Who Can ApplyThe pilot call is specifically designed for local public administrations in the EU and Digital Europe Programme (DEP) Associated countries and partners working with them (e.g., companies, civil society organisations, academia). The consortia must be capable of executing a cross-sectorial and cross-border pilot activity, and co-finance at least 50% of the pilot activity.Consortia Eligibility CriteriaEligible consortia must consist of at least two local or regional public administrations from different EU member states and/or DEP Associated countries, promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and dealing with the European Green Deal objectives.The local administrations can also involve other eligible parties working with them (e.g., companies, academia, civil society organisations and others). The pilot consortium members are subject to restrictions due to security reasons. Entities must not be controlled by an ineligible country. If there is a risk for such case, entities will be offered an opportunity to provide a guarantee. All entities (except entities that are validated as public bodies by the EU countries) have to fill in and submit an Ownership Control Declaration (OCD). OCD must be self-declared at proposal time, and if the pilot is awarded, the official OCD must be provided within 14 days from the notification date. If a chosen pilot consortium member is found, after assessment, to be controlled by a partner from a non-EU country, they will need to present a guarantee that will be assessed to allow or exclude participation in the pilot project. If a partner is found to be controlled by a DEP-associated country, they will also have to prepare a guarantee that will need to be assessed to allow or not allow their participation in the pilot.ScopeThe pilot consortia must create new data services from the data sharing across at least two areas specified below, but can also include other European Green Deal domains:predictive traffic management/sustainable mobility planning, establishing also synergies with the mobility data space and making use of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators, where appropriate; data-services related to weather, climate and extreme weather events to facilitate risk prevention, disaster resilience as well as climate change adaptation; management of energy flows in a city/community specific context and in conjunction with other sectors; zero pollution actions (e.g., air, water, soil pollution or waste);and any other domain falling under the New European Bauhaus initiative (urban design, building management, public services, nature-based solutions, amongst others.Available funding and Co-FinancingEach pilot is planned to be funded with 1 to 1½ million euros by EU contribution to share amongst the consortium members of the pilot. If justified, this can also be less than 1 million euro. The funding should be balanced proportionally amongst the pilot sites, and one partner can receive a maximum of 1 million euro as grant (this also applies when applying for more than one pilot or in following open call rounds). The total EU contribution for the DS4SSCC-DEP pilots is 15.3 million euros, which is planned to be distributed to around 12 chosen pilot consortiums.The financial criteria for applicants involves a co-funding model. Applicants are expected to bear at least 50% of the project costs, as direct co-financing. This means that for any pilot proposed, the grant will cover only up to half of the total expenses. Applicants must directly indicate the co-financing as a dedicated cost in the budget for the pilot and demonstrate their capacity to provide it through their own resources. To be eligible, co-financing cannot include in-kind resources not explicitly monetized in the pilot budget, and all activities must observe relevant regulation, including state-aid rules and risks of double funding. As normally, all costs need to be actual, incurred during the pilot period time-frame and have to be auditable.This approach ensures shared investment and commitment from both the funding body (EU) and the applicants, aligning with the principles of partnership and joint responsibility. The model is designed to encourage meaningful participation and investment in the project, ensuring that the applicants are equally invested in the success and sustainability of their initiatives. It's crucial for applicants to clearly articulate their funding strategy and show their ability to meet these financial requirements in their application.The piloting consortium is expected to receive 50% of the total grant at the start, upon signing of the grant agreement, and the remaining 50% will be paid out in two instalments against actual performance, evaluated during midterm and final reporting period. For more information about the Financial Framework, please refer to the Call for Pilots Manual at https://ds4sscc.eu/cfp-oneAdditional informationWe strongly recommend participants to get acquainted with the preparatory action and the established DS4SSCC data space blueprint (https://inventory.ds4sscc.eu/), as it serves as the foundation for proposed solutions and describes the specific requirements that pilots need to follow. We invite applicants to be part of the Stakeholder Forum to engage and network with likeminded organisations aiming to realise the objectives for Data Space for Smart Communities. This forum also offers opportunities to directly liaise with the DS4SSCC-DEP consortium members.

They shape society and significantly impact our lives in almost every aspect. Mobile devices like phones and tablets in particular have become pervasive: they are our gateway to the world at large, function as an external brain and are increasingly part of even our most intimate moments.People should therefore be far more empowered when it comes to such a critical dependency. Even a mere user should be able to dive under the surface and learn more about the underlying layers of the technologies they depend on. Software and hardware should be open, transparent and reusable. This facilitates reuse, exchange and collaboration between developers and suppliers, but it is also a necessary requirement for consumers and organisations to make conscious choices about which technologies to use and which ones to avoid, and to start thinking about how together we shape technology rather than the other way around. If we want everyone to use and benefit from the internet to its full potential without holding back, the internet must be built on strong and transparent technologies that allow for permissionless innovation and are equally accessible to all.Mobifree is a pilot programme designed to push beyond the status quo of mobile software, and create a virtuous cycle of innovation through free and open source software, libre hardware and open standards. It has brought together a number of the ""movers and shakers"" of the open mobile ecosystem, in order to deliver a comprehensive development effort and advance a number of important free and open source technologies.Together we work towards better technologies to restore and maintain European sovereignty and to secure democratic ownership of the digital society. Our goal is to help mobile technology evolve to a more healthy state, provide people with concrete new tools and more reliable infrastructure, in order to provide better security and allow users more agency and choice. But this is a vast domain, with many more challenges than what any preconceived effort could tackle by itself. This is why we invite your contribution to help us reshape the state of play, and together create an open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all.Part of the budget of NGI Mobifree (15% to be precise) is reserved for open calls to fund additional free and open source efforts that are aligned with the topics and approach of NGI Mobifree. We invite your contributions to help reshape the state of play of mobile software andgive European citizens and organizations more choice in, and access to, human-centered and ethical mobile software.Maybe you are working on wholly new contributions towards opening up the mobile ecosystem, for instance in terms of open hardware, software, firmware or protocols. Perhaps you've conceived another way to remove current gatekeepers, choke points or surveillance capabilities. Maybe you are walking around with ideas to improve or enhance concrete existing applications (such as those further developed within NGI Mobifree, eg. F-Droid, Conversations or Micro-G). Or improve on other important solutions in terms of usability, security, privacy, interoperability, high availability and scalability — to allow everyone to benefit from mobile technologies without unnecessary drawbacks. You tell us how you believe we can move things forward.Project results must be made available under a free and open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code to create technology that fits their own purposes. We are seeking project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euro's — if the project works out well you can subsequently scale up in other programmes funded by NLnet such as NGI0 Core or NGI0 Commons Fund. Privacy-friendly human-centered and ethical mobile software should become the 'new normal' of the internet, something ordinary users should not have to worry about — users should be in control. So let's make it happen.Through the open calls, we assist independent researchers and developers to join in and create powerful new technologies and put these in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society. Help us build a sustainable and open economy that benefits all, and submit your idea today. Not sure whether your idea fits?

Yet online payment systems tend to allow for far less privacy than paying with a bank note or coins, especially when using proprietary solutions like Google Pay or Apple Pay. When interacting with the offline economy comes into play, the alternative of paying with all kind of volatile cryptocurrencies isn't a viable option either.NGI TALER is a project funded by the European Commission and the Swiss State to roll out a new electronic payment system that benefits everyone: people, merchants, banks, financial authorities, auditors and anti-corruption researchers. The project doesn't have to start from scratch either, but builds on the strong foundations of GNU Taler — the privacy-preserving digital payment system developed by the GNU community and Taler Systems SA. This offers privacy for those that make payments, while enforcing transparency on those that sell. By providing micro payments at very low overhead, GNU Taler permits internet business models to shift away from advertising revenue or subscription models, especially for online publishers. No-risk transactions can lower transaction fees and open online payments for the underbanked population and citizens marginalized from digitalisation.Part of the budget of NGI TALER (15% to be precise) is reserved for open calls to fund additional free and open source efforts that are aligned with the topics and approach of NGI TALER. We invite your contributions to help reshape the state of play of digital payment systems, and to help create an open, trustworthy and reliable internet for all. Of course you can contribute exciting new capabilities to GNU Taler itself, build auxiliary tools or work on user experience, but you could also be developing integrations into FOSS applications and open standards (enabling P2P micropayments in for instance an instant messenger, open social media platform or video conferencing tool), or work on improvements to infrastructure components like merchant backends. Together with the rest of the Next Generation Internet initiative, we move towards restoring and subsequently maintaining European sovereignty and to secure democratic ownership of our digital societies.In order to enable you to make such contributions, we will award up to 676 254 euro in small to medium-size R&D grants towards technology commons that empower users, and establish a new generation of privacy-friendly digital payments systems. The programme will run between now and November 2026, but budgets are limited — so grab your opportunity.Project results must be made available under a free and open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code to create technology that fits their own purposes. We are seeking project proposals between 5.000 and 50.000 euro's — if the project works out well you can subsequently scale up in other programmes funded by NLnet such as NGI0 Core. Reliable, low-cost, secure and resource efficient payments should become the 'new normal' of the internet, something ordinary users should not have to worry about — users should be in control. So let's make it happen. Note that GNU Taler itself was funded through such Next Generation Internet projects, so there is every opportunity to grow.Through the open calls, we assist independent researchers and developers to join in and create powerful new technologies and put these in the hands of future generations as building blocks for a fair and democratic society. Help us build a sustainable and open economy that benefits all, and submit your idea today. Not sure whether your idea fits? Don't be afraid to send something completely out-of-the-box if you think you can contribute to the topic (and it fits with the eligibility criteria): it really is an open call.Want to learn more about Taler before you submit a proposal, or have other questions?

Free and open source software and hardware, open standards, open data & AI, open science, creative commons and open educational resources are democratising innovation and learning, and are together driving society and industry forward at an unprecedented pace. But it is also obvious that there are major gaps that need to be fixed still. The answer to market failure and dystopian runaway technology lies in collective action and public investment.This is where NGI Zero Commons Fund come into play. The goal of this new fund is to help deliver, mature and scale new internet commons across the whole technology spectrum, from libre silicon to middleware, from P2P infrastructure to convenient end user applications. We have a holistic, full-stack approach, simply because there is no other way. If we want to reclaim the public nature of the internet and yield the full benefits from technology as a society, we need to have full coverage — period.Only though enough critical mass of shared building blocks and collective resources will our governments, businesses and civil society be able to secure their security and long term operational availability. The same approach that empowers individuals to take full control of their digital lives, will also steer towards more fair, innovative economies and societies. So let's make it happen!The changes we want to see are vast, and there is much technical debt to resolve as well. We are looking for troubleshooters that help society tackle the hard but very very important challenges ahead. Ultimately we believe in the power of the quadruple helix — the collaboration of the public sector, aligned companies, academia and civil society — to restore the internet (and our economies) back to health. Together we can create a strong and open internet for all, and bring about new paradigms like the European Commissions vision for Web 4.0 which aim to harness upcoming techologies like virtual and augmented reality, generative AI and intelligent mediators in a responsible way so they may sustainably serve society.We need new ideas and disruptive technologies, while at the same time evolving and growing existing technologies that are still future-proof.Have a look at other NGI Zero programmes to see the kind of efforts we mean, but don't be afraid to send something completely different if you think you can contribute to the topic — it really is an open call.Project results always become available under a free or open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code or open data to create solutions that fits their own purposes. The right to reuse and right to repair not only allow for unrestricted scrutiny and permissionless innovation, but also help to reduce e-waste. And the use of standards enables interoperability and redundancy in implementation to reduce the risk of compromise and failure.NGI0 Commons Fund is made possible with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology.Additional funding is made available by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI).",,,"Projects can be submitted through https://NLnet.nl/propose, please check this page as well as the guide for applicants before you start writing a proposal - this might save you a lot of work.Anyone can apply, including private individuals and organisations of any type.

It is expected that computational prediction will be used to create a collection of immunogen designs for multiple selected viruses within the Filovirus family, and if possible, to design cross-protective antigens. These designs should then be evaluated for expression, antigenicity, and stability. Selected immunogen designs should be combined with vaccine platforms to generate exemplar vaccine candidates that can be further tested in in vitro and in-vivo preclinical experiments. The most promising pre-clinical exemplar vaccine candidates should then be advanced into translational development up to the end of phase I clinical trials.Scope of the CallDevelopment of multivalent Filovirus vaccinesIn addition to the licenced Ebola Zaire vaccines, there are different other candidate vaccines under development for Ebola viruses and Marburg virus; their combination into multivalent vaccines could provide the desired breadth of protection against the Filoviruses that have caused the majority of outbreaks in humans. The intent is to support the translational and clinical development of multivalent vaccine candidates up to the end of phase II clinical trials and explore pathways to licensure (ideally based on immuno-bridging approaches).Multivalent vaccines or individual monovalent vaccines on the same platform will ideally have an established preclinical proof-of-concept (PoC) as well as initial clinical safety and immunogenicity data.Creation and evaluation of a vaccine library for a range of FilovirusesThe CfP intends to consider and evaluate application proposals for the use of computational methods for immunogen design and to support experimentally based methods (where applicable) for immunogen verification against several members of the Filovirus family.The desired outcome from this effort is to have the resultant immunogen designs combined with and tested in various vaccine technology platforms, contributing to a Filovirus vaccine library (i.e., consisting of a knowledge-base, working seed materials and reagents, and/or candidate formulations) that are either ready and available to be used in future Filovirus outbreaks or that create a solid base for the rapid generation of new vaccines for emerging Filoviruses. Immunogen designs should be generated through state-of-the-art computational and structural methods, and tested for their ability to present the right epitopes to maximize the adequate immune response, to be properly expressed in the chosen vaccine technology platform, to generate a protective immune response in animal models, and if possible, to be amenable to early clinical proof=of-concept of safety and immunogenicity. Antigens that are broadly protective against multiple filoviruses are preferred. CEPI encourages applications from consortia that can tackle the different aspects of vaccine library development, as well as preclinical and clinical testing.CEPI has the capability to support development through its centralised laboratory network and animal models network, and/or adjuvant library (that can be screened for optimal adjuvants for a particular candidate) where applicable.

Drawing on insights from previous Mission activities, it seeks to leverage research and innovation outcomes. The programme combines multiple levers of change, including social, cultural, technological, nature-based, regulatory, and financial innovation, as well as new business and governance models, to drive the climate transition.Through the combination of interventions supported in this programme, cities will collectively aim to achieve breakthroughs in enabling whole-city innovation and subsequent implementation at scale (direct Outcomes), that will ultimately lead to the reduction of GHG emissions and maximising Co-benefits, by unlocking the deployment of solutions at whole-city level (long-term targeted impacts).The selection of proposals will result in multiple implementation-enabling innovations focussing on resolving key implementation barriers. Interventions will work individually and in combinations/clusters to generate resolutions for shared challenges.Activities eligible for funding are:Interventions should consist of the following activities to be eligible for funding:Pioneering activities to support climate-neutrality, including the deployment of innovative (new or improved) technology, product, process, service, solution, policy, or governance model at city level, explored in a cross-sectoral and systemic manner.Systemic, science-based innovative initiatives that strengthen cities' use of scientific research and ensure translation of research results into policy actions, to accelerate climate neutrality in the sectors/domains of water, food, energy, industry, housing and deep building retrofitting, transport, and mobility through the levers of green technology (i.e., digitalisation), behavioural/lifestyle change, social innovation, culture, policy and regulation, finance, and new business models (e.g., circular economy). These innovations shall account for co-benefits (e.g., health promotion) and the ""Do No Significant Harm” (DNSH) principle.Activities to support climate-neutrality to establish new knowledge and build capacity and capabilities of city government and associated local actors through training, workshops, and other forms of learning.Activities aiming to build more collaborative communities, to advance new governance models at city level, and to engage citizens (including vulnerable/marginalised groups) and enable them to act on climate change in a systemic and cross-sectoral manner.Please note: proposed interventions may cover several or all of these descriptions of eligible activities - this list is intended to allow for flexibility in proposing interventions, rather than limiting proposed interventions to any one eligible activity alone.Applicants will be requested at the point of submitting a proposal to describe and declare the links between their proposed interventions and the eligible activities as listed above.For more information please refer to the Call Guidelines.",,,"The aim of this call is to select from Mission Cities a portfolio of interventions aimed at enabling city transformation within the context of the Cities Mission and its goals. Unlike the Pilot Cities Programme, which aimed at identifying and overcoming barriers to climate action in cities, the Enabling City Transformation (ECT) Programme is designed to explore and implement enabling innovations for whole-city transformation. These innovations should lead to practical, replicable learning at scale and support many other European cities. Cities and city groups should therefore focus their proposals on building enabling factors and conditions for transformation in ways that other cities can practically use, and that will be replicable across the Mission.The aim of this call is to select from Mission Cities a portfolio of interventions aimed at enabling city transformation within the context of the Cities Mission and its goals.How to submit a proposal?The applications are submitted online via the grant management platform:If not already registered with the system, use this link to register.If you have previously registered with the system (i.e. for applying to one of the Pilot Cities Programme calls): please use this link (and bookmark it!) to log-in.If you do not remember your password, please use these password reset instructionsGuidance on how to submit your application:How to register in the System?FAQ & InstructionsPlease note that any proposals submitted outside of the proposal submission system will not be accepted; and that the system will be locked after the deadline. If you experience technical difficulties, please consult the system guidance. If you are still unable to resolve your system issue, please contact NZCsupport@climate-kic.org. For all other non-technical related queries, please contact ect@netzerocities.eu.Who can apply?Only local authorities or city administrations selected to be part of EU Mission for climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 (Mission Cities) are eligible to apply to and receive funding under this Call. For the avoidance of doubt, this call is addressed to designated Mission cities only and therefore these consortia may not include other city, district, or municipal authorities (i.e., 'non-Mission'). Please note: Administrations of a higher level of governance (i.e., a metropolis, region, or national/governmental departments) are eligible to participate as consortium partners where there is a formal governance link with the Mission City/cities leading or involved with the proposal. However, they do not count towards the eligible Mission City count (i.e., as related to the prescribed budget envelopes and the number present in the proposal) unless the metropolis or region is itself the Mission City, formally.A group of Mission Cities (national or trans-national) may apply together in a consortium. However, in that case, one of the Mission Cities will have to be designated as the consortium leader for all administrative and process-related purposes. In the case of a group of cities applying together in one proposal, the size of the requested subgrant must follow the award amounts as stated at section 4.1 of the Call Guidelines.Other organisations could also participate as members of a consortium led by a Mission City. These organisations could be, for example: research institutions, universities, SMEs, NGOs, associations, citizen groups or other relevant stakeholders involved in the implementation of the climate ambitions of a Mission City participating in the consortium.For comprehensive information, including eligibility criteria, please consult the Call Guidelines.Evaluation processThis Call will follow a three-stage evaluation and selection process:Stage 1: Eligibility checkThe eligibility check stage entails the assessment of pass/fail requirements (see 5.2 in the Call Guidelines) that are assessed by the SGA-NZC Consortium. Proposals must comply to the full set of eligibility criteria to proceed to Stage 2.Proposals that fail the eligibility criteria will not be considered further in the process and applicants will be informed of the outcome.Stage 2: Evaluation and scoring of eligible proposalsProposals will be scored against the individual assessment criteria (see section 5.3 in the Call Guidelines) by at least two independent external experts, based on the submitted proposals. These experts are appointed from the pool of experts identified through an open call and contracted by the coordinator as part of the NetZeroCities project. The experts from this pool are deployed against all Calls for Pilot Cities and the call for Enabling City Transformation interventions. This evaluation is made using sub-criteria grouped into the three main categories of: Mandate to Act, Capacity to Act, and Impact.The detailed criteria for assessment of proposals for the SGA-NZC Enabling City Transformation programme's financial support to third parties scheme is defined in section 5.3 of the Call Guidelines.Stage 3: Strategic Portfolio SelectionThe selection committee will select a portfolio of interventions through a dedicated selection process. The portfolio will be selected with the intention to support Mission Cities to overcome challenges to, experimenting with, and learning about, the implementation phase of the Cities Mission: i.e. enabling (Cities) Mission innovation implementation. It will also aim at complementing the existing cohorts of Pilot Cities (i.e. inter-cohort portfolio) selected through previous calls, creating opportunities to exploit learning and outcomes of these diverse interventions over the course of the programme.The selection of the interventions to be supported through the subgrants will build on the review by independent external experts and the scores noted in Stage 2.All submissions will be assessed fairly and transparently in the scope of the eligibility criteria, assessment of quality criteria, and strategic programme considerations as outlined in section 5.4 of the Call Guidelines. Decisions as to whether a proposal is accepted or rejected will be communicated as detailed in this document.","FundingThe total available budget under this call is 22.8 million Euros (EUR). Funding rules defining the budget allocation to any one proposal and - subsequently selected intervention - follows a logic linked to the number of Mission Cities included in any one proposal:500,000 - 600,000 EUR[1]1,000,000 EUR: proposals with a minimum of two distinct Mission Cities (i.e. formally selected as such), plus any additional consortium partners.1,500,000 EUR: proposals with a minimum of three distinct Mission Cities (i.e. formally selected as such), plus any additional consortium partners.[1]As per the Grant Agreement text (HORIZON-RIA-SGA-NZC-101121530), the minimum grant to be allocated to a proposal through this Call is 500,000 EUR, with the maximum grant to be allocated to a proposal being 1,500,000 EUR. An upper range in this subgrant envelope is set to provide sufficient funding for at least one city and consortium partner, relative to the other subgrant envelopes. Therefore, for this envelope proposals may have a budget range and grant allocation request between 500,000 and 600,000 EUR.: proposals with a minimum of one Mission City plus at least one additional consortium partner (NB: the additional consortium partner may be another eligible Mission city/district).Timeline: 5 June 2024, 12:00 CEST - call launch14 October 2024, 17:00 CET - call deadline6 December 2024 - decision communicationDecember 2024/ February 2025 - Boot CampDecember 2024/ March 2025 - Award Agreement development17 March 2025 - programme starting date16 September 2026 - programme ending dateInfo Sessions: 12 June 2024, 14.00-15.30 CEST - Ambition, Approach & System and technical information (register)19 June 2024, 11.30 - 13.00 CEST - Eligibility and Assessment Criteria (register)September (date to follow) - Impact Framework and Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL)September (date to follow) - Refresher: Ambition, Approach & System and technical informationSeptember (date to follow) - Refresher: Eligibility and Assessment Criteria, and Q&ARelevant documentation: Call guidelines: Provide information on the aim, scope, and approach of the call and clarify how to submit a proposal, budget requirements, and the review mechanism and decision-making process.Call Financial Guidelines: Explain the application budget and contain the main legal and financial rules.Budget Template: An Excel-based budget template to support cities and their consortium partners to draft budgets, prior to putting them in the submission system.Call Form Template: A Word template containing the application narrative questions and check-boxes for other submission requirements.

[1] https://www.flagera.eu[2] https://www.m-era.net/",,"This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation. As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions, workers, regions, and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations, and will be differently affected by these changes, creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development, but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027). Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes. The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:Leadership in AI based on trust The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.EIT Digital plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ​An Internet of Trust The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.eXtended Reality (XR) Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and conditionThe objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry. This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.Activities beyond R&I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade”), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.European standards for industrial competitiveness The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.International cooperation The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment). It will also contribute to the overarching objectives of our continental partnership in full alignment with the principles of the Global Gateway.Cooperation with Latin America will aim at exploiting the potential of the newly established BELLA network and implement the outcomes of EU-LAC dialogues in the context of digitalisation and R&I.Additionally, international collaboration is encouraged or targeted in several thematic areas may also be addressed within the respective Joint Undertakings (Smart Networks and Services, EuroHPC, and Key Digital Technologies).Innovation Actions — Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Scope:Target group(s): Research and innovation ( related actors such as vocational schools, higher education institutions, public authorities in the field of education and employment, innovation agencies, SMEs, deep tech companies, the European Innovation Council (EIC) and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) start-ups and industry, research performing organisations, knowledge and technology transfer offices and associations, students and researchers.Educational and research institutions are considered key places for knowledge production and innovation, and should be well connected within and beyond their respective regional innovation ecosystems. By increasing the connectedness of educational and research institutions, host regions will be able to increase their competitive advantage by fostering and possibly attracting talent, high-tech companies, and boosting innovation output in the area;However, due to the diverse innovation landscape in Europe, educational and research institutions from better-connected innovation ecosystems benefit from more local accelerators with greater funding opportunities and more qualified business support services compared to their counterparts in other areas, including rural or peripheral areas.The action should foster the creation of innovation ecosystems with educational and research institutions, or strengthen their existing links. Proposals should outline activities for supporting educational and research institutions to take a greater entrepreneurial role, e.g. through boosting innovation and entrepreneurship within their activities. The action should also ensure that educational and research institutions' assets and vision are articulated clearly and in line with respective regional specialisations (such as smart specialisation strategies), so they can easily be integrated into innovation ecosystems and economic value chains.The proposals should leverage best practices of the private and public sector in the EU's well performing innovation hubs and enhance collaborations between businesses with R&I actors in educational and research institutions. The proposals should build on the educational and research institutions' focus areas and relationship to innovation, matching regional and business interests (and where relevant complement smart specialisation strategies), in order to maximize each stakeholders' strengths and accelerate progress. The proposals should outline activities that will foster connectedness of the innovation ecosystems while preventing brain drain and encourage talent to stay in emerging regions, including rural areas. Only by providing local talents, including female talents, with knowledge and opportunities to contribute to the local private sector or develop their own businesses, local innovation ecosystems can expand based on sustainable and inclusive growth. The proposals should valorise high levels of technical skills, including in deep tech, in developing innovation ecosystems with hands-on knowledge and experiences in business management and international scale-up processes.The action supports co-designed programmes of activities of at least two (2) years, proposed jointly by educational institutions, research institutions, and other R&I actors from 'emerging' and 'moderate' innovation ecosystems and the private sector from innovation hubs ('strong innovators' and 'innovation leaders'), to ensure better connectedness between higher education institutions and research organisation with other actors of innovation ecosystems, for example:Engagement of business experts into the implementation of networking activities and building innovation ecosystem around the university/research institution;Engagement of students, graduates, researchers and workforce from various disciplines and departments into the innovation ecosystem, with a focus on networking and building networks around educational and research institutions as centres of gravity, and engaging in companies' structures and business processes;Engagement of students and researchers in start-ups from both their immediate local environment and beyond (regional, national, transnational) working with various actors from the innovation ecosystem to experience what starting and running a venture entails, such as raising funds, pitching events, creating, editing, and adapting business models in the creation process from idea to market, etc.;Creation of synergies between students, graduates, researchers, innovators, education institutes, research performing organisations, and business partners, locally, at EU level, and globally targeting the creation of networks and communities of practices in the field of deep tech to stimulate the market uptake of results and new technologies, as well as their co-creation. The proposed programmes of activities should ensure gender-balanced participation opportunities.To ensure that the impact of the action goes beyond consortium members and their respective countries, it is encouraged that the selected consortia work closely with innovation agencies from their respective territories and beyond, and seek synergies with relevant EU initiatives in the field of university-business cooperation, such as knowledge and innovation alliances under the Erasmus+ programme or the EIT Knowledge Innovation Communities (KICs) to allow for complementarities and possible use of already existing EIT KICs' knowledge, expertise, networks, communities or platforms such as those developed under the EIT Initiative on Innovation Capacity Building for Higher Education[4]that focuses on strengthening partnerships between higher education and businesses including developing innovation and business support services. [1]Deep tech innovation aims to provide concrete solutions to our societal problems by finding its source in a deep interaction with the most recent scientific and technological advances and by seeking to produce a profound impact in the targeted application areas.[2]A New European Innovation Agenda COM(2022) 332 final.[3]More information on entrepreneurial competences under the Entrepreneurship Competence Framework.[4]More information under ""Pilot Call: HEI Initiative - Innovation Capacity Building for Higher Education.""",,"Today's urgent challenges are inherently complex and systemic and will not be solved by individual actors or territories in isolation. Fostering enabling innovation ecosystems across the European Union (EU) requires a systemic approach that is inclusive and collaborative, involves diverse actors, institutions and places, maximises the value of innovation to all, and ensures equitable diffusion of its benefits.As highlighted in the European Commission Communication on a New European Innovation Agenda[[A New European Innovation Agenda, COM(2022) 332 final]], by increasing the inclusion and interconnection of less represented regions and actors into a more strongly integrated European ecosystem, the EU can capitalise on the experience, needs, visions, and perceptions of an increasingly diverse range of people, companies and places. In doing so, it can also take forward a uniquely inclusive European innovation model that is sustainable, guards against substantial labour market and wage gaps, and associated threats to territorial and social cohesion.Moreover, such well-connected and diverse ecosystems provide innovative companies with the necessary support and conditions to thrive, i.e. through additional capabilities, data, customers, knowledge, and talents. Network connectivity within and between innovation ecosystems greatly contributes to sustainable business growth with high societal value. Therefore, the actions of this destination aim at strengthening and expanding cooperation between innovation players to better support the next generation of innovative companies whose solutions will lead the shift towards a more competitive EU and a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient world.Besides stronger innovation performance, increased competitive sustainability, and more rapid transitions to a green and digital society, ecosystem integration can provide ecosystem actors and companies with access to new resource, markets, customers, and contribute to disruptive strategies and innovative solutions. By being actively engaged in their local, regional, national, and European networks, companies can increase their overall growth potential.This destination offers a holistic package of actions that:Strengthen innovation ecosystems across the EU through fostering more efficient, inclusive, gender diverse, and connected innovation ecosystems, by accelerating the development and deployment of innovation, including deep tech[[Deep tech innovation aims to provide concrete solutions to our societal problems by finding its source in a deep interaction with the most recent scientific and technological advances and by seeking to produce a profound impact in the targeted application areas.]] innovation and encouraging co-planning, co-implementation, and co-investments around European strategic priority areas;Ensure the inclusion of all key innovation players from across the quadruple helix,[[A model of cooperation between industry, academia, civil society and public authorities, with a strong emphasis on citizens and their needs.]], and all EU territories, including rural areas[[Long-term vision for the EU's Rural areas (COM(2021)345 final.]];Mobilise policies, funding instruments (EU, national, regional) and fostering synergies between them;Improve public and private buyers' capacity to procure innovative solutions and enhance coordination on innovation procurement initiatives within Member States and Associated Countries;Improve the connection of individual innovators with other ecosystem actors and innovation support providers;Ensure openness and cross-fertilisation of the innovation ecosystem within and beyond the EU's borders. In particular, the actions under this destination should promote the creation of links:Between all key innovation stakeholders, including the private sector, in particular between SMEs, start-ups and other innovators, including social innovators with investors, industry and public and/or private buyers for faster access to funds and markets and the public sector including authorities in charge of national, regional or local innovation policies and programmes and bodies responsible for smart specialisation strategies; also between SMEs, start-ups and foundations, civil society organisations, citizens, and individual inventors; with universities and research and technology organisations (RTOs) as sources of innovation and talent, to ensure that innovations match existing needs, values, and expectations of society, thereby accelerating deployment and up-take towards tackling societal challenges, and, if applicable, with innovation actors from peripheral or rural innovation ecosystems (such as start-up villages[[More information under ""Start-up villages: a commitment to a long-term vision for rural areas.""]]);Among 'innovation leaders' and 'strong innovators' with 'moderate' and 'emerging innovators'[[References: Regional Innovation Scoreboard (RIS), European Innovation Scoreboard (EIS), Global Innovation Index (GII).]] across the EU and Associated Countries[[Associated countries are described in General Annex B.]] to increase innovation cohesion[[The work programme will act in complementarity with the 'Widening participation and strengthening the European Research Area” work programme]];With networks such as National Contact Points, Partnerships for Regional Innovation (PRIs[[More information under ""Partnerships for Regional Innovation.""]]), the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), and European Innovation Council (EIC) communities, the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN), clusters and Euroclusters, European university alliances, Missions, pan-European platforms such as Startup Europe, public and private regional or local innovation actors, in particular incubators and innovation hubs (e.g. European Research Area hubs and Digital Innovation Hubs), that could be interconnected to favour partnering among innovators. Where appropriate, the applicants should consider and actively seek synergies with possibilities for further funding from other relevant EU, national and/or regional innovation programmes, including Cohesion Policy funds, the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the EU's External Action instruments, the Economic and Investment Plans for the Western Balkans, Eastern and Southern Neighbourhoods, and other public and private funds or financial instruments.Expected impactProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to strengthening robust interconnected innovation ecosystems and creating a favourable environment to promote the scalability potential of businesses, including in the deep tech sector, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:Interconnected, inclusive, and more efficient innovation ecosystems across the EU that draw on the existing strengths of European, national, regional, and local ecosystems and engage new, less well-represented stakeholders and less advanced innovation territories, including rural areas, to set, undertake, and achieve collective ambitions tackling challenges for the benefit of society, including green, digital, and social transitions, and advancing the European Research Area and the New European Innovation Agenda;Enhance cross-border network connectivity and inter-regional collaboration of regional innovation valleys by reinforcing their capacity to create, reshore, and renew European value chains towards the sustainable green and digital transition and the EU's open strategic autonomy in EU countries and/or regions;Strengthen and expand cooperation between innovation ecosystems worldwide;Foster more inclusive and gender equal innovation ecosystems;Reducing territorial inequalities in access to innovation support. Interconnected Innovation Ecosystems: Regional Innovation Valley Label The New European Innovation Agenda's flagship on accelerating and strengthening innovation in European Innovation Ecosystems across the EU and addressing the innovation divide aims to accelerate innovation and unlock excellence across the EU through various tools. It focuses on creating the basis for the emergence of connected regional innovation valleys across the EU, notably involving regions with a lower innovation performance, by building on strategic areas of regional strength and specialisation, in support of key EU priorities.In line with the New European Innovation Agenda, the Commission intends to identify up to 100 regions committed to enhance the coordination and directionality of their R&I investment and policies, at regional level. It is expected that these regions will prioritise 3-4 inter- regional innovation projects including in deep tech innovation, linked to key EU priorities.The Commission will award the 'Regional Innovation Valley” Label [[The 'Regional Innovation Valley” Label will also be awarded to successful applicants under the EIE (""Successful applicant regions under this call topic will be recognised as 'regional innovation valleys"""") and Interregional Innovation Investment Instrument (I3) calls under European Regional Development Fund (""Under this call for proposals regions will be recognised as Regional Innovation Valleys..."")]] to regions that submitted an application to a dedicated call for expression of interest [[Flagship 3: Accelerating and strengthening innovation in European Innovation Ecosystems across the EU and addressing the innovation divide - European Commission (europa.eu)]] and which, in the opinion of independent experts, demonstrate a clear commitment to: Enhance the coordination and directionality of the region's R&I investment and policies, at regional level in support of key EU priorities and to address the most burning challenges facing the EU, namely reducing the reliance on fossil fuels, increasing global food security, mastering the digital transformation (including cybersecurity), improving healthcare and achieving circularity;Engage, building on shared or complementary smart specialisation areas (where applicable), in interregional collaboration to develop innovation, including deep tech innovation, and help increase innovation cohesion by addressing Europe's persistent innovation divide between regions at different levels of development and/or innovation performance by including regions with lower innovation performance;Strengthen and connect their regional innovation ecosystems, including for example through joint innovation action plans to constitute connected regional innovation valleys building on their Smart Specialisation Strategies (containing milestones and targets) and, where applicable, on the participation in the Partnerships for Regional Innovation (PRIs). The award of the Regional Innovation Valley Label is a recognition of the above commitments of regions and does not result in receiving funding under the Horizon Europe Programme.",,,

Digital transition Digital technologies present an enormous growth potential for Europe. In line with the Europe fit for the digital age priority, this thematic priority targets investments in businesses and public administrations (notably in the part related to the innovation sector) with regards to the digital transition. Projects will unlock the potential for digital growth, deploying innovative solutions that improve accessibility and efficiency of services (both for businesses and citizens) while bridging the digital divide.This thematic priority encourages applications in one or more or a combination of the following investment areas (non-exhaustive list):a. Digital economy innovation The deployment of innovative solutions for businesses digitalisation and digital services, including the use of artificial intelligence;ICT up-take in SMEs applied to traditional and emerging sectors; B2B; B2C; Customer to Customer, including infrastructures and services (digital innovation hubs, living labs, etc.);Demonstration of innovative digital technologies in view of the commercialisation of research results and a better integration in EU value chains;User driven innovation and valorisation of traceability and big data;Companies reinforcing EU cybersecurity value chain and protecting from hacking, ransomware and identity theft;'Digital based” open innovation, supporting entrepreneurial discovery processes and cooperation between academia and businesses in the framework of smart specialisation;Digital skills for companies adopting innovative digital technologies (upskilling and reskilling) in the framework of investments relevant for Smart Specialisation. b. Digital transformation of public administration and public services New or significantly upgraded services for e-government, including the take-up of Europe wide interoperable services which improve the efficiency of services delivered by public administrations to citizens, companies and other public bodies by using information and communication technologies such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity;Investments in innovative solutions helping administrations to make services user-friendly, accessible and more interoperable. Those investments might include the demonstration of the validity of new digital technologies in view of the large-scale adoption of new IT systems, e.g. technologies for digitalisation in the health care system. Green transition Turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities is the ambition of the green transition.

In this context, the CSA will also assist with the update and promotion of the EOSC Interoperability Framework and assist in the set-up a process for its updates.The CSA should execute at least two use cases to demonstrate and promote the use of the federation services provided by the EOSC Core Platform (EU Node) and document the experience and lessons learned. The use cases should be driven by real-life user needs and consider the long-term sustainability of such federations. The use cases should include Research Infrastructures able to federate within EOSC and users which gain novel capabilities for their research work.Through the outcomes of the use cases, the CSA should propose to the EC and current EOSC governance a set of operational Rules of Participation and common set of policies and minimum requirements to be applied consistently across the EOSC federation.This set of rules, policies and requirements should be detailed in such a way they can be introduced in the operation of ESFRI, ERICs and other international, national or institutional RIs at the subdomain, domain and interdisciplinary levels as concerns the EOSC federation.They should be developed, maintained, and updated in accordance with the progressive deployment of the EOSC Core, EOSC Exchange and EOSC sustainability models and be based on latest input by the Task Forces of the EOSC Association and any additional, relevant input by the research community. Scope:Proposals are expected to cover the following activities:The CSA should explore concrete use cases of federations of Research Infrastructures and data/service providers to the EOSC Core Platform (EU Node). The CSA should contribute to the further evolution of the Rules of Participation and Acceptable Use Policies based on the identification of specific commitments and needs of the different contributors of the EOSC federation, and contribute to the related development of guidelines and recommendations on various aspects (incl. interoperability framework), and with this further promote the EOSC Core Platform (EU Node). This work should be done in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders, such as the contractors providing the Managed Services for the European Open Science Platform (EU Node)[1] , Research Infrastructures, thematic EOSC communities and EOSC national nodes.To this end, the CSA should engage with and further build the EOSC federation community, and assist in the development of a common framework on the various aspects of the federation, including the following dimensions:LegalBusiness model and incentive structureInteroperability framework, including the support for FAIR principle and handling of PIDs across EOSC federationEOSC Authentication and Authorization InfrastructureEOSC Security CoordinationEOSC Rules of Participation. Coordination and collaboration with the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC) is required in order to take stock of identified common data infrastructure requirements, including technologies, processes, standards, and tools that will allow reuse of data across the various data spacesAlso, synergies should be established with the contractors of SIMPL[2] as foreseen in the latter's procurement technical specifications, to avoid duplicating efforts and funding among major Union initiatives. The CSA should further provide an analysis of the status quo including the identification of gaps, on the basis of which an actionable roadmap shall be established with actions differentiated by main actors and levels (EU or national, topical or cross-cutting).The proposed work should incorporate the necessary coordination efforts and resources with other relevant projects and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) governance structure in the context of the EOSC partnership.

It encompasses rules of engagement, standards, abstractions, technologies, and services, which will enable and enhance seamless access to and reliable re-use of FAIR[[ Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable, https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/]] research outputs (i.e. data and other digital objects), including those generated or collected by other research infrastructures, and covering the whole research data life cycle (generation, storage, sharing and publishing, discovery, access, processing, management, analysis, re-use, etc.). The EOSC will contribute to the European Strategy for Data, including its thematic common interoperable data spaces, and the provision of secure and FAIR-enabling European cloud services.EOSC development has been supported through a series of Horizon 2020 projects and an interim EOSC governance structure preparing the next stage of EOSC development for the period after 2020. These projects have contributed to the creation of a pan-European access mechanism; coordination of national activities for EOSC on-boarding; connection of European research infrastructures (e.g. ERIC and other world-class RIs) and existing e-infrastructures; initial development and operationalisation of the FAIR principles and a FAIR-compliant certification scheme for research data; the EOSC portal providing access to a range of services, guidelines and training; and the development and provision of a number of research-enabling value-added services, including distributed data processing and management (both public and commercial). From 2021, the EOSC partnership will help ensuring directionality (common vision and objectives) and additionality (complementary commitments and contributions) of the stakeholders involved.Building on this progress, the INFRAEOSC destination aims to continue to develop the EOSC in a more cohesive and structured manner so that it becomes a fully operational enabling ecosystem for the whole research data lifecycle. This ecosystem includes FAIR research data commons (e.g. data, services, tools), based on key horizontal core functions, with corresponding e-infrastructures and service layers accessible to researchers across disciplines throughout Europe, leading to a 'Web of FAIR Data and Services” for Science. The EOSC ecosystem will contribute a data space for science, research and innovation articulated with the other data spaces described in the European Strategy for Data.Expected impactProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to one or several of the following impacts:Transforming the way researchers as well as the public and private sectors create, share and exploit research outputs (data, publications, protocols, methodologies, software, code, etc.) within and across research disciplines, leading to better quality, validation, more innovation and higher productivity of research;Facilitating scientific multi-disciplinary cooperation, leading to discoveries in basic research and solutions in key application areas;Seamless access to and management of increasing volumes of research data following FAIR principles (that are open as possible) and other research outputs stimulating the development and uptake of a wide range of new innovative and value-added services from public and commercial providersImproving trust in science through increased FAIRness, openness and quality of scientific research in Europe, supported by more meaningful monitoring and better facilitators for reproducibility, validation and re-use of research results, and by improving pathways for the communication of science to the public.

Scope:This topic supports the assessment of the state of RIs in Ukraine, the identification of key needs and the development of an investment roadmap for RI reconstruction, closing the skills gap and facilitating well-connected R&I communities.To this extent, proposals should address the following aspects:Assess the situation of RIs in Ukraine, including the damage to Ukrainian RI capacities caused by the war;Building on EU experience in research infrastructure roadmapping, in particular in the context of ESFRI, identify priorities for development, re-construction and or re-orientation of the RI capacity in Ukraine, including digital ones, taking into account political priorities such as the green and digital transition and resilience;Identify areas that would require the development of specific RI concept and design, in view of future integration into the European RI landscape;Involving RIs policy makers, RIs and RIs stakeholders in EU and Ukraine to develop the strategy for investment in short and long-term;Support training of Ukrainian RI staff, including through study visits and staff exchange with equivalent EU RIs as well as exchange of best practice activities. Environmental (including climate-related) impacts as well as the optimisation of resource and energy use, and the appropriate exploitation of advanced digital technologies should be integrated in the road-mapping exercise.In accordance with General Annex B of the General Annexes, legal entities established in non-government controlled territories of Ukraine are not eligible to participate in any capacity.",,"Over recent years, the European Commission, Member States (MS) and Associated Countries (AC) have been closely collaborating, in particular within the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), to develop an integrated and efficient ecosystem of research infrastructures (RIs) in Europe, which encompasses single-sited facilities, distributed facilities integrating resources across the European Research Area, as well as networks of national facilities and which serves researchers and engineers in all S&T fields, from basic to applied research. To facilitate integration and pooling of resources for the development of new capacities, a legal instrument has also been developed at European level, the European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) that provides favourable conditions for the establishment and operation of large European infrastructures supported jointly by several MSs and ACs as well as by third countries. While Member States remain central in the development and financing of public RIs, the Union and ESFRI play a catalysing and leveraging role in driving the integration between national efforts.The challenges for the near future are to consolidate and optimise the European Research Infrastructure landscape and enhance its capacity to support frontier research and address the emerging and new scientific and societal objectives associated with the transition towards a sustainable and resilient Europe. In addition, there is the need to define and implement an effective and sound RI strategy in Europe, in close cooperation with ESFRI, MSs and ACs, which is complemented by and interlocks with the long-term ambition of creating an integrated Technology Infrastructure (TI) landscape, the latter is supported in Pillar II of Horizon Europe Programme (HE). Such a strategy would also help in exploiting synergies between RI and TI financed from Horizon and massive investments in infrastructures from ERDF.This destination aims to create a world-leading coherent, responsive, sustainable and attractive RI landscape in Europe, by reducing its fragmentation at European, national and regional level, ensuring coordination of efforts and fostering alignment of priorities among MSs and ACs, connecting RIs to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), and which is able to support national and regional R&I ecosystems. The support to a European strategy for Research Infrastructures as well as activities to enhance the role of RIs for international cooperation and science diplomacy will also be covered under this destination.Expected impactProposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to one or several of the following impacts:Disruptive research and breakthrough science and innovation through cutting-edge, interconnected and sustainable Research Infrastructures;Strengthened scientific excellence and performance and efficiency of the European Research Area, increasing its attractiveness to researchers from all over the world;Coordinated research infrastructure capacity among countries and regions, also by exploiting possibilities given by the smart specialisation processes;Reinforced R&I capacities enabling systemic changes needed for a truly transformative societal and economic recovery and a strengthened resilience of critical sectors, as outlined in the Recovery Plan;Improved European response, in cooperation with international players, to emerging socio-economic and related scientific and technological challenges at global level.

Scope:A SNAP will not have to cover all actions foreseen in the strategy/plan or ensure that the strategy/plan will be fully implemented during the lifetime of the SNAP. However, the SNAP shall include strategic actions to catalyse a process and mobilise supplementary commitments and funding that will lead, in due time, to the full implementation of the plan or strategy.SNAPs shall promote the coordination with and mobilisation of other relevant Union, national or private funding sources for the implementation of the complementary measures or actions outside of the SNAP in the framework of the targeted plan or strategy, giving preference to Union funding. Within the SNAP itself, however, co-funding may not come from other Union funding sources.SNAPs shall actively involve the main stakeholders necessary for the implementation of the targeted plan or strategy. They should be involved in both the design and implementation of the given project. This involvement is expected to be achieved by including them - where possible and reasonable - as associated beneficiaries of the SNAP, or through their active participation in the implementation of the SNAP itself and/or of the complementary actions.SNAPs should facilitate and result in the building up of strategic capacities among the competent authorities and stakeholders to ensure a long-term sustainability of project results and actions, and to ensure that they will be able to function as co-deliverers of the targeted plan or strategy after the end of the SNAP.Depending on the needs of the given Members States (or regions) as identified in their PAFs or in other nature and biodiversity plans (which must be available by the time a SNAP full proposal is submitted), the set of measures to be included in a SNAP programme of actions shall include the following: institutional support and capacity building actions; mobilisation and coordination of additional finance for complementary actions, in particular from other EU funding instruments and programmes. In addition, SNAPs:may also include concrete conservation and restoration measures, in particular where these cannot be supported through other EU funding programmes;shall also work to change (when applicable) the rules for other funds or adapting other policies/actions which might be leading to failure of the target plan/strategy. The SNAP complexity requires an adaptive approach in the design of the implementing mechanism. For this reason, SNAPs will be implemented based on a revolving programming mechanism structured in phases (i.e. Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.). Each phase should normally last at least 3 years, to reduce administrative burden, although duration might be shorter if properly justified.See Call document and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for a more detailed description of SNAP scope and features. Expected Impact:By the end of the project: at least substantial contribution to the implementation of the targeted plan/strategy, and mechanisms established to ensure full implementation of the plan/strategy.After the project: Full implementation of the plan/strategy.

Scope:SIPs should aim at the full implementation of the strategies and plans listed in ""Objective"". This might not mean that the SIP will cover all actions foreseen in the strategy/plan or that the strategy/plan will be fully implemented during the lifetime of the SIP. However, the SIP shall include strategic actions to catalyse a process and mobilise supplementary commitments and funding that will lead, in due time, to the full implementation of the plan or strategy.SIPs shall promote the coordination with and mobilisation of other relevant Union, national or private funding sources for the implementation of the complementary measures or actions outside of the SIP in the framework of the targeted plan or strategy, giving preference to EU funding. Within the SIP itself, however, co-funding may not come from other EU funding sources.SIPs shall actively involve the main stakeholders necessary for the implementation of the targeted plan or strategy.

This involvement is expected to be achieved by including them - where possible and reasonable - as associated beneficiaries of the SIP, or through their active participation in the implementation of the SIP itself and/or of the complementary actions.SIPs should facilitate and result in the building up of strategic capacities among the competent authorities and stakeholders to ensure a long-term sustainability of project results and actions, and to ensure that they will be able to function as co-deliverers of the targeted plan or strategy during or after the end of the SIP.The SIP complexity requires an adaptive approach in the design of the implementing mechanism. For this reason, SIPs will be implemented based on a revolving programming mechanism structured in phases (i.e. Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.).
