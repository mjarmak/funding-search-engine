101165535;TOY;SIGNED;Machine learning in science and society: A dangerous toy?;2025-01-01;2029-12-31;1500000;1500000;HORIZON.1.1;ERC-2024-STG;2024-10-17;HORIZON;ERC-2024-STG;ERC-2024-STG;HORIZON-ERC;;"Deep learning (DL) models are encroaching on nearly all our knowledge institutions. Ever more scientific fields—from medical science to fundamental physics—are turning to DL to solve long-standing problems or make new discoveries. At the same time, DL is used across society to inform and provide knowledge. We urgently need to evaluate the potentials and dangers of adopting DL for epistemic purposes, across science and society. This project uncovers the epistemic strengths and limits of DL models that are becoming the single most way we are structuring all our knowledge, and it does so by starting with an innovative hypothesis: that DL models are toy models. A toy model is a type of highly idealized model that greatly distorts the gritty details of the real world. Every scientific domain has their own toy models that are used to "play around" with different features, gaining insight into complex phenomena. Conceptualizing DL models as toy models exposes the epistemic benefits of DL, but also the enormous risk of overreliance. Since toy models are so divorced from the real world, how do we know they are not leading us astray? TOY addresses this fundamental issue. TOY 1) identifies interlocking model puzzles that face DL models and toy models alike, 2) develops a theory of DL (toy) models in science and society based on the function of their idealizations and 3) develops a philosophical theory for evaluating the epistemic value of DL (toy) models across science and society. In so doing, TOY solves existing problems, answers open questions, and identifies new challenges in philosophy of science, on the nature and epistemic value of idealization and toy models; in philosophy of ML, by looking beyond DL opacity and developing a philosophical method for evaluating the epistemic value of DL models; and by bringing siloed debates in ethics of AI together with philosophy of science, providing necessary guidance on the appropriate use and trustworthiness of DL in society.";2024-11-01 18:00:13;267049;10.3030/101165535

Administrative overburdening arises from a continuous increase in the number of rules that require implementation and the relative stagnation in administrative capacities. This discrepancy between the rules up for implementation and the administrative resources available results in suboptimal policy outcomes, low-quality public services, and inconsistent implementation practices. In view of this assessment, it is the central objective of SUPA to examine strategies for enhancing the capabilities of the public sector to cope with the escalating challenges of administrative overburdening. To this end, SUPA pursues two interrelated objectives: The first one is to examine how decision-making procedures and practices can be improved to limit the overall burdens placed on the administration. The second goal is to explore how administrative structures can be reformed to manage ongoing rule growth effectively. SUPA examines patterns of rule growth and the resulting administrative changes and challenges in six European States (Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the Netherlands) and the European Union. Based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, SUPA (1) evaluates the effectiveness of so-called "rule-offsetting" schemes; (2) investigates how legislators can embed legal design principles to prevent unintended rule growth cascades; (3) assesses how policy growth affects the underlying administrative structures; and (4) examines citizens' experience and operational challenges linked to different ways of distributing implementation burdens across public authorities. SUPA has formed collaboration agreements with multiple public authorities, ensuring that the Consortium's findings can be directly transferred to both policy-makers and administrators in the field.";2024-10-09 16:54:16;266533;10.3030/101177315

The project’s research strategy aligns with the EU’s enshrined principle of subsidiarity, to deliver new insights on how bottom-up arts and culture can channel inclusive political expression and advance societal well-being at a time when democracy faces unprecedented challenges. Pilots cover all EU regions, together with cases in the Americas, Africa, Middle East and Asia, in democratic and non-democratic contexts. It considers online and offline realities as inextricably intertwined, with smartphones forever within reach. Our comparative, transdisciplinary, multi-stakeholder approach is founded on creative, participatory methodologies. Collaboration with community centres, theatres, exhibition halls, among other spaces, brings tested creative tools to mobilize people into civic participation and mitigate polarization. Working with digital designers and developers, #DemocracyinAction tests the unknown potential of virtual immersive spaces, including novel trends of virtual nightclubs, to deliver cutting-edge policy recommendations for a democratic and safe use and design of social media and metaverse environments. These tools and recommendations will offer forward-looking pathways to scale up grassroots' potential and enhance positive political participation at local, national and EU levels.";2024-10-09 16:47:20;266479;10.3030/101178843

The goal is to enable them to become dynamic agents of inclusive and sustainable transitions within their respective ecosystems.To achieve this, WISESHIFT will develop a scientific conceptualization at the crossroads of social economy studies, sustainable transition studies, and multi-level governance policy analysis. The project will start with a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of WISEs and their implementation of work integration pathways for vulnerable workers across the 27 EU Member States and Serbia. Next, WISESHIFT will conduct an in-depth analysis of 24 WISEs and their contributions to inclusive and sustainable transitions within their respective ecosystems, focusing on three domains: repair, reuse, and recycling; agrifood; and community/home care for the elderly. The third objective of WISESHIFT is to perform a comprehensive cross-cutting analysis using the Multi-Level Perspective to identify the organizational factors specific to WISEs that make them potentially "inclusive and sustainable by design." The fourth objective is to develop a comparative and multi-level framework of analysis to address challenges posed by policies and regulations to the WISEs and, through their lenses, to the social economy.Overall, the ambition of WISESHIFT – is to contribute to strengthening the tangible role of social economy organisations as catalysts for transformative and systemic change towards more inclusive and sustainable practices within their ecosystems as envisioned by the EU social economy strategy.";2024-10-09 16:53:24;266467;10.3030/101178477
