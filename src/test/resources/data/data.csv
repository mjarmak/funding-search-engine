To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Citizens and patients will get effective, preventive, integrated, coordinated, evidence- based and people-centred high-quality health and care services to identify and tackle or prevent multi-morbidities, frailty, biologically or mentally reduced capacities, (sensory) impairments, dementia and/or neurodegeneration, fostering mental and physical health, wellbeing and quality of life. These could include, but are not limited to, assistive technologies, nutrition and physical activity, adaptation of work and workplace, health- promoting age-friendly working, home and community environments, better equality of access to health and care services through community-based and integrated care models, also digitally enabled. ?	Primary and community based health and care services will be better equipped to early identify people at risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and multi- morbidities. They will have integrated and cost-effective intervention tools to help prevent, monitor and manage progression of age-related diseases, conditions and disabilities, while promoting healthy lifestyles, ageing in place12, as well as physical and mental wellbeing among the elderly.
?	Older people, including those receiving long-term care, will be empowered to take an active role in the management of their own physical and mental health, as well as increase their social interactions and wellbeing through better health literacy, educational programmes, trainings and platforms, including with the help of innovative and digitally enabled solutions.
?	Citizens, all relevant stakeholders, public authorities, cities and rural environments, as well as health care providers will be engaged to ensure the introduction to and the integration of age-friendly, mental and physical health promoting innovative care pathways and digitally enabled solutions into the daily life and wellbeing of the ageing population, with the aim of leaving no-one behind.
The proposals should provide appropriate indicators to measure performance and progress towards the relevant expected outcomes.

be to promote healthier societies by developing holistic solutions that foster healthy lifestyles from early age with long-term impact(s).
Digitalisation poses risks but can also be a driving force for empowering young citizens, who are growing up in an increasingly digitised world, in taking an active role in the management of their own health conditions, mental and social well-being, and promote healthy lives and disease prevention, through innovative solutions, coordinated person-centred care models and better health literacy.
The topic encourages the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as of European, national and regional authorities and civil society, in order to strengthen the scientific and technological expertise of SMEs in the health and care domain to promote the uptake of innovative health and care solutions in Europe.
The proposed research and innovation should focus on several of the following aspects:

?	Develop and advance person-centred, evidence-based and coordinated disease prevention intervention solutions to support children and adolescents? health and care in an increasingly digital society. The effectiveness of the intervention solutions should be evaluated, inter alia, in terms of health outcomes, (comparative) cost-effectiveness, implementation facilitators and barriers. The target group should include children and adolescents up to 25 years of age from different socio-economic backgrounds.
?	Develop and integrate innovative, privacy preserving tools and technologies, such as (but not limited to) activity trackers, sensors, serious games, platforms and robotics, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in coordinated and integrated care models, to help children and adolescents lead healthy, active and social lifestyles, prevent diseases, as well as to better monitor and manage their physical, social and mental health. Empower children and adolescents to navigate the health and care systems, interact with their doctors, formal and informal carers, social circles, as well as better manage their own health at home, in the community and at school, taking into account specific youth psychiatric risk factors, the risk of addiction, as well as the geographic, social and economic determinants of health and digital literacy inequities.
?	Stimulate the adoption of person-centred approaches and solutions for better health, care and well-being of children and adolescents, by including stakeholders from all the relevant sectors (including but not limited to education, leisure, social innovation, healthcare, Medtech, media and citizens) in the co-creation, design, planning and adoption of the solutions, as well as the training of their end-users.
?	Develop and disseminate evidence-based guidance and tools for children and adolescents promoting healthy balance between a sedentary digitised lifestyle and a more active non- digitised lifestyle in support of their physical, mental and social health and well-being on short- and long-term basis.

?	Develop, implement (pilot and/or scale-up) and promote person-centred tools and interventions for better physical and mental wellbeing, addressing the risks of digital addiction and overconsumption, isolation and mental illness, by promoting physical, intellectual or artistic activities, social interaction and providing mental health support and treatment.
In all instances, gender as well as demographic, geographic and socio-economic aspects should be duly taken into account.
This topic requires the effective involvement of youth throughout the project. Moreover, social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise must be present in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Moreover, greater involvement of non-health sectors directly affecting risk factors and determinants of health, for example (physical) environment, food and nutrition, security, education, sports, finance, industry is desirable/encouraged, as relevant.
Proposals should be highly integrated, ambitious, go beyond simple networking and provide appropriate indicators to measure progress and impact.
Selected projects under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in joint activities as appropriate. These joint activities could, for example, take the form of clustering of projects and involve joint coordination and dissemination activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices and adoption strategies on regional, national and European level.

that end, proposals under this topic should aim at delivering results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:
?	Citizens have access to and use effective personalised prevention schemes and health counselling (including through digital means) that take into account their individual characteristics and situation. Individuals can be assigned to particular groups based on their characteristics, and receive advice adequate to that group. Stratification of a population into groups showing similar traits allows for effective personalised disease prevention.
?	Health professionals use effective, tried and tested tools to facilitate their work when advising both patients and healthy individuals. Public health programme owners gain insight into the specificities and characteristics of disease clusters within the population through stratification. This can then be used to facilitate the identification of population groups with elevated risk of developing certain diseases and improve the programmes, update them and design effective strategies for optimal solutions and interventions.
?	National and regional programmes make better use of funds, data infrastructure and personnel in health promotion and disease prevention, primary and secondary healthcare. They can consider the use of new or improved ambitious policy and intervention options, with expected high population-wide impact, for effective health promotion and disease prevention.
?	Companies generate opportunities for new product and service developments to cater to the needs of the healthcare service and individuals.
Scope: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are responsible for the majority of the disease burden in Europe and are the leading cause of avoidable premature death. The human and financial cost of NCDs is high and expected to grow. Reducing the burden of NCDs requires a holistic approach and tackling health inequalities across the board. Preventing NCDs from developing in the first place will be at the core of successful public health programmes in the future.
Personalised approaches and the development of targeted interventions have led to an impressive progress in several fields of medicine and have been included in many treatments. However, the use of stratification and individualisation in guiding prevention strategies is still not widely in use even though examples of its potential are accumulating. Identifying people at risk of developing a particular disease before the disease starts to manifest itself with symptoms greatly improves treatment options. It is estimated that about two thirds of all NCDs are preventable, many affecting people who are unaware of their disease risks or do not have access to information pertaining to the management of the condition.
Personalised prevention is the assessment of health risks for individuals based on their specific background traits 32 to recommend tailored prevention 33 . This can include any

33	Possibly along with digitally supported disease management schemes.

evidence based method 34 . Personalised prevention strategies complement general public health prevention programmes without replacing them, optimising the benefit of both approaches. Personalised prevention is ideally suited to the use of large data sets, computational and omics approaches, with design and use of algorithms, integrating in-depth biological and medical information, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and ?virtual twin? technology, taking into account explainable and transparent AI35.
The funded projects will work towards reducing the burden of NCDs in line with the ?Healthier Together? ? EU Non-Communicable Diseases Initiative36. This does not limit the scope of projects under this topic to particular diseases as any disease area of interest, co- morbidities and health determinants37 can be addressed.
Accordingly, the proposed research is expected to deliver on all of the following points:

?	Enable the understanding of areas of unmet need in NCDs prevention, possibly also addressing disease mechanism, management of disease progression and relapse. Providing new approaches for prevention, focussing on the digitally supported personalised dimension, that can be adopted and scaled up.
?	Devise new or improved ambitious policy and intervention options, with expected high population-wide impact on the target groups in question. To be proposed and made available for effective health promotion and disease prevention including targeted communication strategies to successfully reach out to the risk groups.
?	Design an integrated, holistic approach that includes several of the following aspects: genetic predisposition to NCDs, meta-genomics, epigenomics, the microbiome, metabolomics, sleep disorders, large cohorts, molecular profiling in longitudinal health screening, impact of lack of physical activity, novel predictive biomarker candidates, diets and nutrition, eating habits for designing customized dietary patterns (geographical variation), and the influence of choice environment on personal choices.
?	Study the ethical, legal and social aspects as well as health economics of the personalised prevention tools and programmes being developed. Consider optimal health counselling and communication to the patients/citizens. Address legal aspects of balancing the right not to know and the obligation of helping people in danger.
Furthermore, the proposed research is expected to deliver on several of the following points, while maintaining a reasonable focus:
?	Develop and validate effective strategies to prevent NCDs and optimise health and well- being of citizens (including the most vulnerable). Propose the strategies to policy makers

34	For example: medication, diet programmes, early diagnostics, monitoring, lifestyle advice and modification, specific training/exercise, psychosocial interventions, meditation, etc.

along with mechanisms to monitor their progress. The strategies need to be aligned with relevant national and European health laws and policies.
?	Provide scientific evidence on interactions between the genetic predisposition to multifactorial diseases and environmental factors or environmental triggers. Propose scientifically supported personalised prevention strategies that ensure how to modify the environmental drivers of behavioural risk factors.
?	Develop new computational tools combining and analysing comprehensive data with different dimensions38 to identify risk factors and modifiers. Creating procedures and algorithms to combine information from different sources (with standardised common data models) to generate risk scores for several diseases and provide health promotion recommendations for the individual as advised by healthcare professionals. Furthermore, develop advanced computational modelling techniques39 for predicting disease risk and predisposition (addressed together in an integrative approach) and identifying the optimal solution/intervention for different target groups and individuals.
?	Develop tools and techniques to increase the efficiency and cost- effectiveness of on the one hand interventions, adjusting their scope, characteristics and resources, and on the other hand healthcare infrastructure and how it promotes and delivers health promotion, disease prevention, and care effectively to the different population groups.
?	Design tools to collect various data to advance health promotion and disease prevention and strategies for providing omics essays for the general patient with a focus on cost- effectiveness and flexibility.
?	Determine how to optimize the benefits of physical activity, smart monitoring of physical activity and sedentary behaviour with measurable data, addressing barriers to uptake and implementation of healthy lifestyles in daily life, understanding what promotion methods work and why, behavioural science to understand healthier choice environments. Balancing the ecosystem associated with the economic, social, and health consequences of NCDs.
?	Conduct data mining of real world data and develop quantifiable and distinguishable indicators from wearables data, taking into account ?light-weight? AI means to ensure patient privacy and short reaction times.
?	Demonstrate with a practical prototype on a given health challenge: from multimodal data collection to identification of an effective prevention strategy to be tested and validated for one or several NCDs.

?	Citizens are engaged and informed about the impact of natural systems? degradation on human health and behaviours aiming at the conservation of ecosystems are promoted.
Scope: Globally, life quality and expectancy have increased to unprecedented levels over the last decades due to the significant public health, agricultural, industrial and technological achievements of the 20th century. On the other hand, the ongoing trend of environmental degradation and global climate and environmental changes has introduced new pressures, which involve large impacts on human health and might put at risk the recent public health gains.
Among others, climate change, biodiversity loss, biological invasions, environmental pollution, changes in land use and degradation, deforestation, thawing permafrost (in polar regions, and particularly in the Arctic), overfishing and acidification of water bodies can result in reduced food and water availability and safety and increased exposure to factors causing infectious and non-communicable diseases. Additionally, changes in weather and climate extremes have been observed across the globe, resulting in an increase of the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heavy precipitation and floods, heat waves and hot extremes, droughts and tropical cyclones.

There is increasing evidence showing that many of these environmental stressors and changes can cause profound short- and long-term negative impacts on human health and well-being, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding and acting upon these challenges calls for a multidisciplinary, cross-sectorial and trans-border approach ranging from the local to the global scale. The effects can be direct due to increases in floods, heatwaves, water shortages, landslides, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, exposure to pollutants, among others, or indirect and complex, as climate change -mediated or ecosystem- mediated. In addition, it is imperative that the solutions and initiatives chosen to prevent environmental degradation are safe for human health and the environment.
Planetary health is a concept focused on the interdependencies between human health and the state of earth?s complex natural systems. A key focus is on understanding how the current trend of human-related environmental degradation can affect the health and well-being of current and future generations. The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health 47 published a report in 2015, laying the foundation for the development of this important new field of study48. In 2020 the Helsinki declaration49 was published, resulting from a conference where participants discussed how to implement the planetary health approach in Europe in the context of the European Green Deal. Planetary health is also a priority topic in the research agenda in environment, climate and health proposed by the Coordination and support action HERA50.
Applicants are invited to submit proposals providing actionable evidence for policy-makers to take preventive actions to protect the human health and wellbeing by exploring the links between human health and environmental degradation in an integrated and comprehensive manner. More fragmented contributions focused on less studied aspects such as the links between climate change and health and, between biodiversity and health, will also be considered.
To advance the knowledge on planetary health to support policy-making in this area, the applicants should address several of the following activities:
?	Provide strengthened evidence for health and wellbeing impacts of planetary changes, considering a systems thinking framework or a fragmentary approach focused on the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on human health (for biodiversity loss, proposals should not focus on the connection between the biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation with the prevention of zoonotic emerging diseases since this topic will be covered by CL6-2023-BIODIV: Interlinkages between biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems and the emergence of zoonotic diseases);

?	Provide a methodology to identify and prioritise threats for public health caused by environmental degradation, with a view to improving preparedness of health systems to these threats, through structured processes that move from evidence to recommendations and decisions;
?	Investigation how infections agents that might have the capacity to adapt to other host species can spread via the environment, and how this type of insight might lead to enhanced monitoring strategies;
?

This would provide early detection of emerging disease outbreaks (e.g. zoonotic diseases, potential permafrost release of new and old pathogens) or changes in nutrition and non-communicable disease burden and support the assessment of the integrated health, environmental, and socioeconomic effect of policies and technologies.
?	Explore strategies to reduce environmental damage and harmful emissions (e.g. air pollution) including assessment of health co-benefits through engagement with relevant HE partnerships and missions;
?	Explore implications of planetary health for health systems and public health and identify opportunities to mitigate adverse health impacts of environmental degradation;
?	Improve risk communication to policy makers, public authorities, industry and the public and support evidence-informed decisions by policy makers, by increasing capacity to do systematic reviews and provide rigorous policy briefs;
?	Advance knowledge and actions to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases while reducing the environmental pressure in areas like nutrition, physical activity, and mobility, and to assess the integrated health, environmental, and socioeconomic effect of those actions (i.e. behaviour change interventions, policies or new technologies);
?	Provide better understanding on adaptation to climate and other environmental changes to protect human health, including the interactions between different planetary boundaries and the need to integrate adaptation and mitigation strategies;
?	Improved health impact assessment approaches accounting for environmental externalities and estimating the cost and benefits of interventions versus no action.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of

relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Researchers should carefully integrate distributive considerations in their analysis by considering, where relevant, disaggregated effects for different socio-economic groups.
All projects funded under this topic are required to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities can, for example, involve the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, the organization of common capacity building activities (e.g. joint workshops) and joint communication and dissemination activities. Therefore, proposals are required to allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and to cover the costs of any other potential networking and joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission will take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate. Networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, can also be considered, if relevant (e.g the projects funded by the Climate Adaptation Mission WP 2021-2022). Proposals should coordinate with the work being developed under EU4Health 2022 CP-g-22-04.01 Direct grants to Member States? authorities: setting up a coordinated surveillance system under the One Health approach for cross-border pathogens that threaten the Union51.

?	Workers living with a chronic disease and/or recovering from a mental of physical health problem are supported to continue/return to work.
Scope: The digital and green transitions (referred to as ?twin transition?) have been changing the workplace at a rapid pace, leading to new forms of work (e.g. hybrid work, gig economy jobs) or changes in the forms of management and work organisation (e.g. through algorithmic decision-making and digital worker performance monitoring) for workers across the spectrum. These changes have varying impacts on the working conditions, income and health and occupational safety both for skilled and unskilled workers. Furthermore, they contribute to the high costs of work-related illnesses and accidents for employers and the European economy in general.
Mental health and ergonomic-related problems affect a significant number of EU workers. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are one of the most common work-related health problems in the EU and workers and managers commonly identify stress, depression and anxiety as serious psychosocial outcomes of workplace exposures. Changes in the organisation of work can bring flexibility that allows more people to enter the labour force, but may also lead to psychosocial problems (for example, insecurity, compromised privacy and rest time, inadequate OSH and social protection, as well as stress due to excessive or atypical working hours, performance monitoring by algorithms and similar AI applications).
Some workplaces have either become exclusively virtual or they have evolved into a ?hybrid? model (e.g. multilocational working, home office), some work tasks and processes performed virtually and others requiring physical presence53. A significant number of jobs are performed at clients? premises or require workers to commute long distances and/or cross borders regularly. Such workers are facing additional legal, social, environmental and economic issues. Data on how these affect their mental/physical health and well-being is scarce.
The emergence and persistence of the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of change, causing, in some cases, additional challenges for workers? mental health (differentially affecting certain segments of the working force) and intensifying already existing physical risk factors (e.g. ergonomic risks). The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan54 aims to promote a healthy, safe and well-adapted work environment in the EU and relies on Horizon Europe for research and innovation supporting economic and social resilience and sustainability. The EU strategic framework on health and safety at work 2021-2027 55 recognises the needs, challenges and opportunities that technological innovation and the pandemic bring for the working population and calls for strengthening the evidence-base for policymaking and implementation.

To address the issues described above, research actions under this topic should include several of the following activities:
?	Provide adequate and robust data on the impact (positive and negative) that the ongoing changes in the workplace are having on the mental and physical health of different categories of workers and working sectors (e.g. teleworkers, cross-border commuters, gig economy workers, and vulnerable groups such as women, migrants and young and older workers with increased demonstrated risk for MSDs), including gender and intersectional analyses, where appropriate;
?	Generate evidence (including data) not only on mental health, but also on mental well- being at the workplace and how changing work organisation due to the twin transitions and the pandemic affects workers? work-life balance and work ability;
?	Generate evidence (including data) on the importance of risk factors (such as stress caused by new working environments, static postures and physical inactivity, physically strenuous and highly repetitive work arising from the workplace design) in the development of chronic and acute diseases;
?	Increase the understanding of the links between different health-promoting factors in the working built environment and physical and mental health outcomes, and how these may be mutually reinforcing;
?	Explore the health impacts of changing working times, including excessive and atypical working hours and work in different time zones that blur work from leisure time, limiting recovery. Effects should consider a wide range of diseases;
?	Provide recommendations for effective interventions to prevent occupational risks and support the mental and physical health and well-being at individual (worker), organisation (employer) and policy (government) levels for different sectors/types of work, including an analysis on their cost-effectiveness, sustainability and barriers to implementation at national and/or EU level;
?	Advance the development of a scientific framework addressing Occupational safety and health (OSH) across policies and sectors and support new and sustainable (future-proof) tools, guidelines and policies concerning the evaluation and design of physical and psychosocial work environment;
?	Provide tools and approaches to anticipate new OSH risks, also taking account of lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance in relation to digital technologies and associated new ways of working.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Researchers should carefully integrate

distributive considerations in their analysis by considering, where relevant, disaggregated effects for different socio-economic groups.
Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative 56 by interacting with the NEB Community, NEBLab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practice, and, where relevant, results.
All projects funded under this topic are required to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities can, for example, involve the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, the organization of common capacity building activities (e.g. joint workshops) and joint communication and dissemination activities. Therefore, proposals are required to allocate a sufficient budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and to cover the costs of any other potential networking and joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission will take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.

Scope: The function and regulation of the endocrine system in humans and other species is of high biological complexity. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs or endocrine disruptors) are chemical substances that alter the functioning of the endocrine system and negatively affect the health of humans and animals. They may either be of synthetic or natural origin. Exposure to endocrine disruptors can occur from different sources, such as residues of pesticides or consumer products used or being present in our daily life.

EDCs are of increasing importance in chemical regulations in the European Union. According to the Comprehensive European Union Framework on Endocrine Disruptors, adopted in 2018, the EU strategic approach on endocrine disruptors for the years to come should be based on the application of the precautionary principle. This approach would aim at, inter alia, minimising overall exposure of humans and the environment to endocrine disruptors, paying particular attention to exposures during important periods of development of an organism, such as foetal development and puberty, possibly integrating a life course approach, as well as accelerating the development of a thorough research basis for effective and forward-looking decision-making. This includes research for the further management of chemicals (including multi-constituent chemicals as well as chemical mixtures), the understanding of the mechanistic effects of endocrine disruptors (including at the molecular and cellular level through the use of new approach methodologies, such as ?multiomics?, cheminformatics, in vitro 2D and 3D models, in vivo models and computational approaches), and the collection, sharing, harmonization and combination of robust data sources.
Closing existing knowledge gaps in the understanding of EDC effects will support more effective and evidence-based regulations at the European level.
Bringing together, inter alia, (molecular) epidemiologists, exposure scientists, toxicologists, endocrinologists, health care practitioners and risk assessors, research actions under this topic should focus on the understanding of the impact of exposures at critical life stages in diseases developing later in life, focusing on the several health endpoints for which there is currently less information available. Advantage should be taken of existing biobanks and disease registries and/or cohorts, with carefully planned measurement strategies and clearly worked- out hypotheses. The issues of non-monotonic dose-response relationships and whether effects are threshold-dependent should be addressed in the study designs. Similarities between endocrine systems and certain health outcomes across species should be exploited to improve understanding of endocrine functioning. Finally, research should attempt at identifying predictive biomarkers (e.g. from liquid biopsies such as saliva, urine, blood) that would allow the tracing of endocrine disrupter-mediated health effects in a shorter period of time than normally would be required for epidemiological studies.
Research actions under this topic should provide forward-looking mechanistic information on potential hazards and health risks of exposures to EDCs, through innovative molecular epidemiological, multifactorial models and systems biology approaches, exploiting the use of new approach non-animal methodologies when relevant, and should include several of the following activities:
?	Studying the impact of EDCs on target organs and in multi-organ models, and physiological barriers, such as the placenta, the blood-brain barrier, the blood-saliva barrier, intestinal, pulmonary and immune cells as well as their interaction with microbiota;
?	Elucidating health endpoints for which insufficient data exist, such as disturbances in the development and functioning of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, the immune

system, bone development and disease, obesity, diabetes, hormone-dependent cancers and fertility (e.g. minipuberty, prepuberty and puberty);
?	Providing better biological and imaging biomarkers to predict EDC-mediated health outcomes;
?	Gaining better insights into the developmental origins of health and disease, especially for those where less data are available. Assessing the occurrence and relevance of multi- and transgenerationally inherited effects, including molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that drive multigenerational effects;
?	Gaining better insights into the most sensitive windows of susceptibility, during which exposure are of particular importance for health effects;
?	Better understanding of the effects of chemicals and chemical mixtures on the underlying mechanistic crosstalk between endocrine axes, endocrine pathways and other key biological systems, including immune, neurological and metabolic functions;
?	Improving the understanding of chemical mixture effects, including with other toxins and at low doses. The role of the microbiome in the activation or detoxification of these chemicals should be explored where relevant.
?	Investigating biological effects of realistic mixtures to get a more detailed understanding of the endocrine effectome, taking advantage of computational toxicology and development of up-to-date models (including state of the art new approach non-animal models such as human organoids and organ-on-a-chip technology);
?	Exploiting non-mammalian species as test organisms, e.g. non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates to predict effects or raise concern about potential effects in humans or vice versa and performing comparative analysis between species;
?	Exploiting systems biology approaches in order to understand how exposure to an EDC results in an altered phenotype, a process that implies complex interactions across multiple levels of biological organization.
Aspects such as gender, regional variations, socio-economics and culture should be considered, where appropriate. Proposals should ensure that chemical monitoring data are shared in IPCHEM61 through involvement with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). Proposals should also consider involving JRC with respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects and/or to translating the research results into validated test methods and strategies fit for regulatory purpose. In that respect, the JRC will collaborate with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal?s approval.

HORIZON-HLTH-2023-ENVHLTH-02-04, Global coordination of exposome research,4/13/2023,CSA,1/12/2023,,, 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 2 ?Living and working in a health-promoting environment?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Environment and health research community, research-policy-making authorities, research funders and other relevant stakeholders work together at the European and international level towards establishing a medium-long-term Global Human Exposome Network;
?	Environment and health research community, authorities working at the science-policy interface and research funders provide options for functioning, financing and governance of a medium-long-term Global Human Exposome Network considering also the strengthening of the coordination of the European Human Exposome Network;
?	Relevant stakeholders profit from a strengthened coordination and collaboration globally among different fields of research and innovation with relevance to deciphering the human exposome;

?	A roadmap and a R&I agenda for international cooperation in specified areas of exposome research and innovation, including, among others, recommendations for exchange of knowledge and data, policy uptake, technological and conceptual approaches and promotion of global level coordinated initiatives on the exposome are made available to the relevant international stakeholders;
?	The coordination of research initiatives, infrastructures, facilities and resources in the area of the Exposome in Europe is supported and reinforced;
?	The interoperability and harmonisation between data and studies is increased facilitating the exchange and use of information across research disciplines and groups.
Scope: The concept of the exposome refers to the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, including its external (e.g. diet, lifestyle, occupational and environmental factors) and internal components (e.g.epigenomics, metabolomics). Developing a comprehensive Human Exposome Project would present a fundamental shift in looking at health, by moving research away from ?one exposure, one disease? understanding to a more complex picture upon which to build solid, cost-effective preventive actions and policies. At its most complete, the efforts could resemble in scope the Human Genome Project.
The European Human Exposome Network (EHEN)63, a cluster of 9 projects funded since 2020 for five years from Horizon 2020, is currently the world?s largest network of projects studying the impact of environmental exposure on human health with an exposome angle. Together, the network of projects aims to study the combination of exposures to pollutants and other stressors, across different life stages and socio-economic conditions, via a number of exposure vehicles such as consumption patterns, lifestyle and working and living environment, and their collective effect on human health.
At the international level, some related activities are ongoing in, e.g., the US (National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences) and Japan. Currently, there is only sporadic cooperation initiatives between the ongoing research at the EU level and important research groups outside Europe. However, in order to fulfil the promise of deciphering the human exposome, a large-scale effort similar to the Human Genome Project could be envisaged, for which a preparatory coordination and support action would be highly useful to identify and discuss the research needs and specific areas of potential cooperation at the global level. Additionally, both at the European and global level better coordination is essential to foster new opportunities to collect, harmonise, combine and analyse large data sets emanating from new and evolving technologies. This offers also new possibilities to understand the pathways leading from a multitude of environmental exposures to the global health burden of common chronic diseases. Standardization and interoperability of data is also needed to assure access to quality data sources at the European and global level.
On the policy side, the outcomes of advancing the exposome research can touch upon and contribute to a better implementation of a wide range of policies and EU priorities such as the

63	https://www.humanexposome.eu/

EU Chemicals Strategy 64, Zero Pollution Action Plan 65, the European Green Deal 66 and climate policies 67 , among others. The benefits of cooperation would also extend to international initiatives such as activities of the World Health Organization related to environment and health68 and the United Nations activities on climate69 and environment70.
Accordingly, proposals should cover, among others, most of the following activities:

?	Proposal for a common agreed conceptual framework for the exposome;
?	Proposal for options for a global governance structure for a Global Human Exposome Network taking advantage of and connecting to the existing research infrastructures and services in the area of the Exposome at the European level;
?	Agreed technologies needed to decipher the external and internal exposome, support longitudinal studies and potential for international cooperation;
?	Proposal for data mining, analysis, opportunities for harmonisation, interoperability, and standardisation in data collection, knowledge storage and transfer, and bioinformatics needs at the European and global level;
?	Cooperation between population and patient cohorts, integrating a large number of variables and comprehensive environmental datasets, and biobanks, covering also the perinatal period;
?	Facilitation of the regulatory uses of results including for regulatory science and risk assessment.
Proposals should interact with existing research infrastructures, services and research projects in the area of the exposome (namely the European Human Exposome Network but also other related projects and actions supported through Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and build on and integrate the work being developed in these initiatives. The composition of the applicant consortia should ensure a broad and balanced geographical representation of Member States and Associated Countries and the proposals should involve also Widening Member States and Associated Countries.

?	The implementation of the Zero-Pollution Action Plan, the Chemical Strategy for Sustainability and the EU legislation on air quality, noise and waste continue to be supported by a strong evidence-base;
?	Relevant actors in our daily lives, e.g. medical personnel, building engineers, teachers, urban planners etc., have access to information such as training courses on pollution and health impacts.
Scope: The European Green Deal set out by the European Commission recognises that man- made environmental pollution is an increasing threat for human health and wellbeing. Opinion polls 74 show that climate change, air pollution, and waste are the three most important environmental issues that European citizens are concerned about. Over three-quarters (78%) of respondents believe that environmental issues have a direct effect on their daily life and health.
Pollution affects a large number of people in Europe and beyond: A 2018 assessment attributed 16% of total global mortality to pollution-related disease. Over 7 million people die of exposure to polluted air every year worldwide75. For 2019, the European Environment Agency has estimated that around 350 000 premature deaths in the EU can be attributed to air pollution (namely from particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone)76. Today, more than 1 in 4 Europeans is exposed to traffic noise levels dangerous to their health in their homes, schools and workplaces77. The increase of artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities has altered the natural light levels in the environment and extended human activities to the usually dark hours. It has been estimated that more than 80% of the world population is living under light polluted skies78. Waste79 continues to be a persistent environmental issue in Europe, and it is estimated that there are 2.5 million contaminated sites in Europe, with potentially significant adverse health effects80.
The global burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has consistently increased over the last decades, being now estimated to account for 70% of deaths globally (World Health Organization). The growing burden of chronic diseases will also be a challenge for Europe?s healthcare systems, these diseases already accounting for an estimated 70-80% of healthcare costs. Currently, around 50 million European citizens suffer from two or more chronic conditions and most of these people are over 65.81 The most recent WHO environmental burden of disease estimations suggest that, annually, 13% of deaths (630 000) in the WHO Europe region are attributable to environmental stressors and an EEA report concluded that, 90% of deaths attributable to the environment result from non-communicable diseases,

including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, mental, behavioural and neurological disorders, diabetes, kidney disease and asthma.72 While early childhood deaths have declined, the years lived with disability have increased, particularly with chronic disease.
The proposed research should strengthen the knowledge base available to policy-makers regarding pollution-disease associations and causal mechanisms at different phases of the life course, taking advantage of latest molecular, cellular and computational technologies to elucidate biological pathways from exposure (including combined exposures) to disease. The work should bring together toxicology, exposure science, public health engineering and environmental epidemiology, and build on data from sources such as pollution-related databases, disease registries, epidemiological studies and biobanks, environmental and human biomonitoring data and new generated data and could consider citizen science and other innovative approaches. All exposure routes should be considered where relevant (oral/digestive tract, inhalation, dermal).
The focus of this topic shall be on three areas where the understanding of and evidence on causality should be strengthened to overcome the current paucity of data and respond to calls from policy-makers. The applicants shall focus on at least one of the following three aspects:
?	Air pollution, especially in the urban environment, taking into account existing evidence, notably the latest WHO air quality guidelines of 2021 and their recommendations on different pollutants 82 , including on pollutants of emerging concern, looking at e.g. ultrafine particles and interactions with aeroallergens, black carbon, sand and dust storms and impact on human health;
?	Noise pollution and light pollution impact on human health;
?	Pollution from hazardous waste (e.g. pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, e-waste, plastics (including nano- and microplastics)) in heavily contaminated environments and adverse health outcomes.
Several of the following activities shall be included:

?	Research activities to strengthen the evidence base for pollution-disease associations and underlying causality mechanisms and biological pathways, taking into account combined exposures and mechanisms of increased sensitivity in susceptible groups;
?	Delivery of FAIR83 data on causal associations between environmental risk factors and health outcomes, in particular for air pollutants of emerging concern, specifically ultrafine particles, black carbon, and others, taking into account vulnerable population

?	Development of user-friendly tools for systematic mining and assessment of the knowledge generated and translation into best practices and to improve the assessment of individual life-exposure to pollutants;
?	Proposals for environmental limit values for the studied pollutants and generation of health impact indicators, where relevant and taking into account existing standards and evidence;
?	Development of guidelines and socio-economic and decision support tools for different actors including policy makers, health professionals and citizens to take action to prevent pollution-related illnesses and impairments, and to enable the choice of healthier lifestyles and behaviours;
?	Identification of cross-sectoral interventions (case studies) with the potential for remediating pollution and risk of exposure and improving human health and well-being in the short/medium term;
?	Development of training courses on pollution and health impacts to inform professionals impacting our daily lives e.g. medical personnel, engineers, teachers, urban planners;
?	Design of best-practice evidence-based communication actions for fact-based risk and benefit communication and improving citizen awareness of pollution and preventive actions, offsetting dissemination of misinformation;
?	Undertaking case studies to demonstrate the added societal value of tools, methodologies and guidelines developed and the implementation of resulting actions to decrease health impacts of exposures.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Reduced health-related suffering and improved well-being and quality of life of patients in need of palliative and end-of-life care and their professional and family caregivers.
?	Patients have early and better access to palliative or end-of-life care services of higher quality and (cost) effectiveness.
?	Patients and their professional and family caregivers are able to engage meaningfully with the improved evidence-based and information-driven palliative care joint decision- making process.
?	Health care providers and health policy makers have access to and use the improved clinical guidelines and policy with respect to pain and/or other symptoms management, psychological and/or spiritual support, and palliative or end-of-life care for patients.
?	Reduced societal, healthcare and economic burden associated with increasing demands of palliative or end-of-life care services that is beneficial for citizens and preserves sustainability of the health care systems.
Scope: The complexity of health conditions related to life-threatening and chronic diseases, acute and chronic pain, late or long-term side effects as consequences of diseases and also their treatments affect quality of life of patients and their families and pose an immense societal and economic burden. Palliative104 and end-of-life care approaches improve quality of life of patients and professional and family caregivers through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other factors such as physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. Although a variety of interventions are in use, they are often not adequately validated or adapted to the specific needs of patients affected by complex diseases or their co- or multimorbidities. Therefore, a need exists to strengthen the evidence base for available patient-centred effective interventions improving quality of life and outcomes of patients of all ages in the domains of palliative and end-of-life care.

Proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Demonstrate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of newly proposed or specifically adapted pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions to improve well- being and quality of life of patients suffering from life-threatening and chronic diseases105 (including disabilities). Whenever relevant, serious late and long-term side effects of disease treatments or symptoms that occur at the end of life of patients should be considered. The legal and ethical aspects of the proposed interventions should be taken into consideration and be fully addressed.
?	Prove the feasibility of integrating the proposed interventions in current pain management, palliative and/or end-of-life care regimes and healthcare systems across Europe. The complex human, social, cultural and ethical aspects that are necessarily managed by those care regimes and healthcare systems should be reflected from patients? as well as those of their professional and family caregivers? perspectives. The views and values of patients and their caregivers (including families, volunteers, nurses and others) should also be appropriately taken into account in patient-centred care decisions.
?	Identify and analyse relationships between sex, gender, age, disabilities and socio- economic factors in health and any other relevant factors (e.g. ethical, familial, cultural considerations, including personal beliefs and religious perspectives, etc.) that could affect health equity106 to the proposed interventions, including equitable access.
?	Analyse the barriers and opportunities to re-invigorating and enhancing timely social inclusion and active engagement of patients in need of palliative and end-of-life care and their caregivers.
?	Provide implementation strategies and guidelines of patient-centred communication for health and social care professionals as well as standards for evidenced based communication trainings for caregivers, considering the potential of social innovation approaches or tools.
?	When relevant, provide policy recommendations for pain management, psychological and/or spiritual support, and palliative or end-of-life care of patients.
Randomised clinical trials and observational studies, targeting different age groups, should be considered for this topic. Proposals should give a sound feasibility assessment, provide details of the methodology, including an appropriate patient selection and realistic recruitment plans, justified by available publications and/or preliminary results.



105	Proposals focused on cancer-related research are not in the scope of this topic. The supportive, survivorship, palliation and end-of-life care of cancer patients was already covered by the specific topic in the Cluster Health Work Programme 2021-2022. Applicants are invited to check the Work Programme of the Mission on Cancer for further funding opportunities for this research areas.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
?	Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving vulnerable populations have access to and use specific guidelines to implement health interventions that decrease risk factors of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) associated with city107 environments.
?	Public health managers and authorities have access to improved insights and evidences on the NCDs caused or impacted by city environments and which factors influence the implementation of preventive actions that address risk behaviours in concerned city populations. They use this knowledge to design improved city planning policies to diminish health associated risks.
?		Adopting an implementation science approach to studying interventions in different city contexts, researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding how specific interventions can be better adapted to different city environments and how the interventions could be scaled within and across cities taking into account specific social, political, economic and cultural contexts.
?	Public health managers and authorities use evidence-based strategies and tools for promoting population health in equitable and environmentally sustainable ways, enabling cities to better address the challenges of rapid urbanisation, growing social inequalities, and climate change.
?	Communities, local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up individual and/or structural level interventions and thus contribute to deliver better health.







107	Non-rural settings; a densely populated urban or peri-urban environment. Cities may also include informal settlements and slums surrounding city centres. Applicants can justify why a particular context may be considered a city.

Scope: The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD)108. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members and aligned with the 8th GACD call.
The topic is focused on implementation research with the potential to reduce the risks of NCDs in cities in LMICs and/or vulnerable populations in HICs. Proposals should focus on implementation science around evidence-based interventions that promote healthy behaviours, and that have the potential to profoundly reduce the risk of chronic diseases and multi- morbidity.
Non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases, respiratory diseases, certain cancers, and mental health disorders, are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both LMICs and HICs109. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought these chronic diseases further into the spotlight, as the majority of those who have experienced severe illness and/or death have had one or more underlying NCD. Reducing the burden of NCDs is therefore critical to building more resilient, equitable, and healthier societies.
Air, water, and soil pollution; lack of greenspace; urban heat islands; lack of safe infrastructure for walking, cycling, and active living; and wide availability of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods and beverages drive the NCD epidemic in city environments110. More than half of the world?s population currently live in cities and this number is projected to rise to 68% by 2050. There is an urgent need to equip local authorities and policymakers with strategies for maximising the health-promoting potential of cities, while minimising or reversing environmental degradation and health inequities.
Cities provide tremendous social, cultural, and economic opportunity, and have the potential to become engines of good health and support climate change adaptation 111 . Innovative health-focused programmes, policies, and infrastructure, such as public smoking bans, bikeable streets, greenspace, and vehicle emission laws, can shape the behaviours of millions of people and decrease exposure to environmental contaminants. Applicants to the current call are invited to conduct implementation research that leads to improved understanding of how specific interventions can be better adapted to different city environments and/or scaled within and across cities, taking into account unique local social, political, economic, and cultural contexts.
The proposed implementation research must be focus on addressing NCD risk factors associated with city environments and related health inequities. In all cases, the selected study population(s) must live in cities, which may include informal settlements near urban centres, peri-urban environments, and city centres. The study population may include people with existing NCDs, those without existing NCDs, or a combination of both. Applicants are

encouraged to take a life course approach, adapting the intervention to one or more key life stage(s) critical for reducing lifelong NCD risk.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Select one or more city/ies in which the research will be conducted. Applicants must justify why a particular context is considered a city.
?	Select one or more evidence-based interventions known to reduce NCD risk factor(s) associated with city environments. Applicants should justify the choice of intervention(s) and provide evidence of the intervention?s effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and potential for long-term health and other impacts. Applicants may also wish to consider implementation research focusing on the WHO Best Buys, though this is not a requirement.
?	Adapt these intervention(s) for selected study population(s) based in one or more city/ies, taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s). Applicants should justify why these adaptations will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).
?	Provide a research plan for investigating how to promote the uptake and/or scale-up of the intervention(s) in the selected study population(s), using validated implementation research frameworks.
?	Specifically address issues of equitable implementation to ensure interventions reach the populations that need them the most.
?	Have an appropriate strategy for measuring both implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators (related to NCD prevention and, if feasible, planetary health and/or non-health sectors).
?	Demonstrate a commitment to stakeholder engagement.
?	Demonstrate a commitment to planetary health in that the proposed intervention, implementation strategies and research practices minimise the consortium?s ecological footprint.
?	Provide a sustainability plan or describe a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention after the funding ends.
The proposed interventions of focus may fall under one or a combination of the following themes:
Theme 1: Behavioural change interventions

These interventions comprise of innovative approaches to helping people live in cities maintain good physical and mental health despite infrastructural, environmental, climate, and social challenges. Behavioural interventions might include, but are not limited to,

programmes and policies that target alcohol and tobacco use, sleep, exercise promotion, healthful nutrition (e.g. in school canteens), addressing the psychosocial impacts of climate change and climate change related disasters, and reducing exposure to environmental contaminants.
Theme 2: Interventions that focus on modifying the built environment112
These interventions focus on modifying the built environment to improve its health-promoting potential113. Proposals should aim to inform urban design such that it reduces NCD risks; for example, by improving a city?s walk- or bike-ability, increasing green space to reduce the health impacts of air pollution or extreme heat, reducing environmental toxins, addressing homelessness or unsafe housing, improving accessibility of healthy foods, decreasing widespread advertising for tobacco and alcohol, or reducing noise and air pollution from road traffic. For proposals that focus on modifying the built environment, applicants should demonstrate that the intervention will be able to withstand expected impacts from climate and/or improve resilience to the health impacts of climate change in city environments.
Applicants should be able to show that the city government or community based organisation that they partner with has a dedicated budget for the construction, maintenance, and/or scale up of the proposed intervention(s), especially for large infrastructure projects. Applicants must also be able to show that the timelines of the research and construction of infrastructure projects will align such that it will be possible to answer the proposed implementation research questions over the proposed duration, and such that the research results will be available in time to inform stakeholder decisions about how the project is implemented, improved, and/or scaled up.
Proposals must include a plan on how to measure implementation research outcomes and the intervention?s real world efficacy in preventing NCDs. In case health outcomes might not be apparent over the duration of the study period, and applicants may therefore instead include plans to measure the intervention?s impact on upstream health indicators, such as those related to the social determinants of health, or to measure other proxy health outcomes. Where feasible and relevant, applicants should also describe a plan for evaluating the planetary health and/or climate impacts of an intervention?s implementation. Applicants are also encouraged to develop a plan for measuring outcomes or indicators relevant to non-health or environmental impacts, especially when working on projects with multi-sectoral themes (for example, themes that cut across health and transportation, social services, waste management, etc.).






112	The man-made components of the environment, such as building, traffic, sewage, parks, and other infrastructure.
113	Proposals are intended for research that helps guide the implementation and/or scale up of the proposed intervention. Therefore, the execution of infrastructural interventions (e.g., constructing bike lanes or housing, etc.) is not in the scope of this topic.

Projects should consider the structural and social determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s) in city environments. Of interest is also the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities114.
Projects should be gender-responsive and consider socioeconomic, racial or other factors that relate to equitable impacts of the intervention or barriers to equitable implementation. The aim should be to adapt and scale-up the implementation of these intervention(s) in accessible and equitable ways in order to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases in real-life settings. Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, physical and mental ableism, ageism, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for health promotion and disease prevention. If there is a focus on a particular population in this context, then the reason for this should be justified.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Proposals should present a strategy to include the relevant policy makers, local authorities, as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organizations involved in the implementation of the intervention, from the development to the implementation knowledge translation phase.
Applicants are encouraged to propose activities to increase research capacity and capability in the field of implementation research among researchers, health professionals, and public health leaders through skill building, knowledge sharing, and networking. In this regard, they may propose plans for capacity building within their proposal, especially, but not exclusively, for early career researchers and for members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or indigenous communities.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge on viruses with epidemic potential and in particular a better understanding of different potential mechanisms of action for the development of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapeutics for these viruses.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel approaches for the development of anti-viral therapies for emerging and re-emerging infections in the context of epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to experimental broad-spectrum anti-viral candidates against emerging or re-emerging viral infections for further clinical investigation.
?	A diverse and robust pipeline of broad-spectrum anti-viral drug candidates is available for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, increasing therapeutic options for clinical deployment in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is expected to accelerate due to among other, climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the development of anti-viral therapeutics in preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks is needed. The availability of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapies would provide a critical preparedness measure against future health threats, due to infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.

Proposals should develop and advance broad-spectrum anti-viral compounds and develop novel approaches to the development of such compounds, which target viruses with high epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU, such as those included in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO) 115 , with particular attention to those identified by the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
Proposals should cover viruses for which there are no currently available effective therapeutics or for which the therapeutics available are sub-optimal, and are expected to incorporate state-of-the-art screening technology and innovative approaches to identify new targets for antiviral compound development. Emphasis should be put on the research and development of broad-spectrum antivirals, which may include repurposing of previously approved or in-pipeline drugs. Proposals could also include elucidation of mode-of-action for candidate anti-viral therapeutics.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global therapeutic research and development pipeline for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the current leading role of the EU in therapeutic research and development.
Proposals should address several of the following areas:

?	Preclinical work and proof-of-concept/first-in-human studies and early safety and efficacy trials for testing new or improved anti-viral therapeutic, with a clear regulatory and clinical pathway. Phase IIb/III phase trials will not be supported.
?	Innovative delivery systems and suitable safety profiles for broad use should be considered when possible. Attention should be paid to critical social factors such as sex, gender, age, socio-economic factors, ethnicity/migration, and disability.
?	Apply novel approaches and widely applicable workflows (e.g. artificial intelligence) for rapid and reliable identification of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapeutics.
?	Timely engagement with the relevant regulatory bodies is expected to ensure adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view.
Applicants envisaging including clinical studies are strongly encouraged to provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See definition of clinical studies in the introduction to this work programme part",
HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE-03-05, Pandemic preparedness and response:  Sustaining established coordination mechanisms for European adaptive platform trials and,4/13/2023,CSA,1/12/2023,,,1.00 to 2.00-2,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 3 ?Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The research community sustains appropriate coordination mechanisms 1) among different EU-wide adaptive platform trials and 2) among established cohorts in Europe and beyond with a view for better pandemic preparedness and response,
?	The adaptive platform trial and the cohort networks maximise coordination and harmonisation of their respective studies within their relevant network for maximum research efficiency and optimal evidence generation.
?	The European adaptive platform trial and the cohort networks coordinate with the European Pandemic Preparedness Partnership, and are well connected to each other and to relevant other regional and global initiatives.
Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic research response has illustrated the importance of clinical research preparedness, as well as the benefit gained from the coordination between European clinical research initiatives. Two key pillars of such clinical research in pandemic

preparedness and response are the clinical (interventional) trials and the cohort (observational) studies.
The large-scale European COVID-19 clinical trials have been gathered under a network for COVID-19 therapeutic trials116 and a network for COVID-19 vaccine trials117 and strong common coordination mechanisms between the trials have been established. The recently launched Ecraid118 is a European clinical research network that has been in development since before the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU-funded projects conducting cohort research in Europe and globally have also come together to establish stronger coordination between them.
This topic aims at maintaining and strengthening existing strategic coordination mechanisms across adaptive platform trials and across cohort studies in Europe and beyond for avoiding redundancies, promoting complementarities and facilitating cooperation among EU-funded clinical research for infectious diseases. Proposals should strengthen the leading role of the EU in clinical research preparedness for future epidemics and pandemics, through ensuring coordination of the European adaptive platform trials and of the European cohort studies. The coordination mechanisms support the longer-term perspective of preparedness for future infectious disease epidemics and pandemics, where the networks enable the conduct of perpetual platform trials and of perpetual strategic cohorts with the in-built agility to pivot to emerging diseases when an epidemic strikes.
Proposals should describe a coordination mechanism for adaptive platform trials and/or for cohort research. The coordination mechanism builds on existing coordination efforts for these networks, providing strategic support and vision for the perpetual trials and cohort studies belonging to the networks in the context of pandemic preparedness. Within the adaptive platform trial network, the coordination mechanism supports reflections e.g. on the diversity of the trial target populations (e.g. primary care or hospitalised patients) or on different possible medical countermeasures (e.g. therapeutics, vaccines), etc. Within the cohort network, the coordination mechanism supports reflections e.g. on diversity in type of cohorts and research questions to be addressed, or on harmonised approaches to data collection and analysis, etc.
Proposals should address proper connections with relevant European initiatives and organisations, such as the European Pandemic Preparedness Partnership, the European Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Authority (HERA), as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Synergies with successful proposals under the HORIZON-INFRA-2023-DEV-01-01 topic should be sought, and collaboration with relevant research infrastructures should be envisaged. Proposals should also be open to engage with global initiatives such as the Global

117	https://vaccelerate.eu/
118	https://www.ecraid.eu/

Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R)119, the Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking120, or the World Health Organization (WHO).
Proposals should address the following areas:

?	Fostering a trusted and proactive environment within each coordination mechanism that supports the timely exchange of research results, allows for discussion on challenges encountered in their research and finding solutions together to ensure cooperation and synergy within each network;
?	Developing a common approach for the European clinical research to enable pragmatic solutions to shared challenges across European clinical trials and/or cohorts for pandemic preparedness and response, guaranteeing the best interest of European trial or study patients or volunteers;
?	Promoting an optimal use of resources, based on a sound scientific approach and maximising the value added for the generation of scientific evidence, through a common baseline approach towards protocol development, harmonised and FAIR 121 data collection and analysis leveraging existing initiatives;
?	Involving relevant European stakeholders, such as representatives from regulatory authorities, industry, policy makers, patient organisations, etc., as well as relevant non- European networks and stakeholders;
?	Promoting the visibility and attractiveness of European adaptive platform trials and/or cohorts for clinical investigators in Europe and beyond ; as well as active communication with the science community, patient advocacy groups and other stakeholders, to develop trust, and also promote innovative approaches;
?	Partners within the coordination mechanism should develop a plan to ensure its sustainability. Coordination with the European Pandemic Preparedness Partnership and the European Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Authority (HERA) is expected.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
?	Policy makers, funders and other relevant stakeholders 122 identify and agree on the governance structure and implementation modalities, allowing for an efficient establishment of a potential future partnership.
?	Policy makers, funders and other relevant stakeholders build on the knowledge gathered in past studies performed at EU and national level.
?	Policy makers, funders and other relevant stakeholders identify and agree on common research priorities and research needs, also taking into consideration developments at the international level where relevant.
?	Policy makers, funders and other relevant stakeholders develop and align national and regional research strategy plans with long-term sustainability in mind.



122	Other relevant stakeholders include researchers, health care providers and practitioners, patients, citizens, regulators and industry.

?	Policy makers and funders commit to providing financial support that will allow for a comprehensive, impact-driven structuring of the field of European brain health research.
Scope: Member States and Associated Countries have agreed to step up their coordination in the area of brain research, which could take the form of a European partnership on Brain Health123 in the second Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe124.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:

?	To structure brain health research in Europe and pave the way for a possible future partnership, this coordination action will develop a structured system of exchange of information between policy makers, funders, and other relevant bodies125 in order to establish synergies and avoid duplication of efforts.
?	It will further facilitate the development of a strategic research and innovation agenda, taking into account the efforts already undertaken by EU-supported actions 126 . The strategic research and innovation agenda will identify a number of measurable, scientific-technological priorities and socio-economic objectives, supported by an appropriate analysis.
?	The coordination action, under the leadership of an EU Member State or Associated Country, should develop plans for a governance structure of a future partnership, as well as implementation modalities with long-term sustainability in mind.
?	It should ensure a broad geographical representation of European countries and plan for inclusion of all main related research initiatives, as well as key organisations and associations. In this way, the coordination action should reflect the ?umbrella? role of a future initiative that will structure brain health research in Europe, and make it more impactful.
?	Consideration should be made for international initiatives by engaging with global organisations127, as well as with global initiatives and research organisations128 in the field.



123	In the context of the partnership, ?brain health? should be interpreted as a concept that encompasses neural development, neuroplasticity, brain functioning, and recovery across the life course, including mental health and wellbeing elements.
124	This topic does not pre-judge the content of the second Strategic Plan of Horizon Europe.
125	Relevant bodies include EU-supported initiatives, scientific and clinical societies, patient organisations, regulators and the industry.
126	This includes the common research agenda developed by the ?European Brain Research Area? (EBRA) project, as well as the strategic research agendas of the partnerships: ?EU Joint Programme ? Neurodegenerative Disease Research? (JPND), ?Network of European Funding for Neuroscience Research? (NEURON), ?Human Brain Project? (HBP) and the ?Innovative Medicines Initiative? (IMI) and its successor the ?Innovative Health Initiative? (IHI).
127	Global organisations include the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD).
128	Entities include the global brain initiatives, the International Initiative for Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR) and the International Brain Research Organisation (IBRO).

?	The action should elaborate on platforms and tools for use by the research community, including on how they best complement, integrate with each other. In this context, infrastructures already developed at the European129 or national level that enable sharing of samples, quality data and advanced analytical tools should be included in the analysis. Reflections should also be made on how the future initiative can contribute to the development of the European Health Data Space.
?	This coordination action implies the preparation and organisation of meetings, as well as support to information exchange with relevant stakeholder groups and with the public.

burden?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to the following expected outcomes:
?	All players along the health care value chain are provided with new knowledge for a better understanding of the links (e.g. causalities) between infectious diseases (IDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and comorbidities, including knowledge on host risk factors that impact the development of disease progression for NCDs and/or IDs.
?	Researchers and clinicians are provided with a robust evidence base that will contribute to the development of new or improved tools to diagnose and prevent the development and aggravation of non-communicable disease(s) as well as early treatment and management of patients suffering from co-morbidities following an infectious disease.
?	Healthcare practitioners have access to knowledge to guide them on preventive measures, on early identification of diseases onset and of those patients at risk of developing severe disease progression, and on the optimal treatment of patients.
When NCDs are related to infectious diseases with pandemic potential, healthcare practitioners will be provided with new evidence to help them make informed decision on the management of the diseases in the future. Public health authorities will be better prepared to issue targeted recommendations linked or not to the use of specific medical countermeasures in crisis times.
Scope: Increasing evidence suggests that several infections might influence the development of many non-communicable diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer, post-covid-19 condition130), or that NCD may be influenced by concurrent presence in the same individual of one (or more) infections. On the other hand, NCDs might represent risk factors for IDs.
The proposals are expected to elucidate and provide a better understanding of causative links between infections and non-communicable diseases onsets, and/or the impact of infections on the exacerbation of existing NCDs or vice versa, in children and/or adults. The analysis of genetics, immune status, immune or inflammatory responses, microbiome, lifestyle and/or other relevant factors (e.g. differences in age, sex/gender, vaccination status, ethnicity) should be integrated to get information for prevention, early diagnosis, risk factors, and to better understand causative links as well as the progression of those non-communicable diseases.
In determining the connection between one or multiple concomitant infection(s) and the development of non-communicable disease(s), the proposals might address any infection including those with pandemic potential (viral, bacterial, or fungal) with non-communicable diseases of major importance. Research on cancer is excluded as it will be covered by the Mission on Cancer.
Special attention should be given to vulnerable individuals, such as those with known existing preconditions.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of vaccine-induced immunity and, in particular, a better understanding of factors that affect the magnitude, breadth, nature and duration of immunity to vaccine antigens.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of the durability and breadth of vaccine-induced immunity in vulnerable populations and older age groups.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of correlates of protection for pathogens with epidemic potential to allow the development of effective vaccines.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge of the characteristics that influence vaccine effectiveness to allow for novel approaches for the development of vaccines for emerging and re-emerging infections, including antigenic variants, in the context of epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines are a critical component needed to bring infectious disease pandemics under control. The availability of effective vaccines that are able to induce a strong and durable immune response are critical to respond to health threats caused by infectious disease epidemics or pandemics. A proactive approach to understanding the factors that affect vaccine durability and strength is necessary to ensure development of effective vaccines for future infectious disease outbreaks.
Proposals should study vaccine-induced immunity in the general population and vulnerable groups. Proposals should look both at the magnitude and breadth of initial immune responses and the duration of immunity after vaccination with different vaccine types (mRNA, vector, inactivated, subunit, attenuated,?). Proposals should assess how sex (e.g. male vs female, pre- vs postmenopausal), age (childhood vs adolescent vs elderly) and/or life style (e.g. obesity, drug addiction, diet, sport) affect the immune response. Proposals may also examine genetic and other molecular factors that may influence immune response in humans. Proposals should pursue a multi-omics approach in order to foster a deep understanding of vaccine induced immunity.

Proposals should identify correlates of protection that can be used to develop vaccines against viruses with a high epidemic or pandemic potential, such as those identified by HERA133 or included in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO)134.
Proposals should also assess how pre-existing conditions or chronic infections influence the immune response.
Proposals should aim to improve the global vaccine research and development pipeline for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the current leading role of the EU in vaccine development, and therefore contributing to the work of the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge on viruses with epidemic and pandemic potential and in particular a better understanding of viral targets for vaccine development.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment for emerging and re-emerging infections in the context of epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to experimental vaccine candidates against emerging or re-emerging viral infections for further clinical investigation.
?	A diverse and robust pipeline of vaccine candidates is available for emerging and re- emerging viral infections, increasing therapeutic options for clinical deployment in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is expected to accelerate due to among other factors, climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the development of vaccines and inhibitors for the cellular uptake of viruses in preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks is needed. The availability of vaccines would provide a critical preparedness measure against future health threats, due to infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.
Proposals should identify targets for optimal vaccine design for those pathogens where information on host-pathogen interaction and viral surface structures is already available. These surface structures may require further characterisation. It is necessary to determine the extent of genetic variation with a view to develop vaccines with variant efficacy. In addition, it is necessary to develop animal and alternative models for the testing of vaccine candidates and for the kinetics, strength, breadth and persistence of the immune response. Proposals should focus on viruses identified by HERA135 and those causing diseases that are in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO)136, with particular attention given to: Hendra and Nipah Virus, Lassa virus, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus, Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, Zika virus, West Nile fever virus and Chikunguya virus. In order to ensure complementarity to ongoing research and

Scope: The Partnership should contribute to priorities of the ?Communication on effective, accessible and resilient health systems? (COM(2014) 215 final), the ?Communication on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market; empowering citizens and building a healthier society? (COM(2018) 233 final) and support the objectives of the new EU4Health Programme (COM(2020) 405 final, Regulation (EU) 2021/522).
This partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe139, in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs (e.g. for rare diseases with so called ?orphan medicinal products?140) and ensuring that the benefits of innovation reach patients in the EU.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, healthcare institutions, innovators, policy makers), the Partnership will create a critical mass of resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA).
The co-funded European Partnership on rare diseases should be implemented based on the priorities identified in the SRIA and through a joint programme of activities ranging from coordinating and funding transnational research to highly integrative and community-driven ?in-house? activities such as innovation strategies for the efficient exploitation of research results, EU clinical trial preparedness activities, optimisation of research infrastructures and

?	Patients organisations;
?	Industry;
?	Charities.
The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and research funders. It will involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and innovation community, innovation owners, health and care systems owners/organisers and health and care agencies.

The Partnership?s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should involve key stakeholders, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations, and innovation owners.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalized and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on ?Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe? as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. The proposal should also consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health, the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), InvestEU, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the Technical Support Instrument (TSI).
Cooperation with international organisations, and non-European institutions and experts may be considered. Participation of third countries is encouraged. Their commitments to the Partnership would not be eligible for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives.
Depending on their individual legal and operational frameworks and in agreement with the relevant services of the European Commission (partner DGs), EU Agencies involved in authorising orphan medicinal products and/or producing knowledge on orphan medicinal products and rare diseases may also join the Partnership, e.g. as beneficiaries.
When defining calls for proposals, this Partnership needs to consider if to require the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Collaboration with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) must be considered to materialise the sharing of (meta)data regarding registries for rare diseases, exchanging data for clinical studies and research based on a unified pseudonymisation tool provided by the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) and related tools and services, as well as in other areas of mutual interest, such as training and capacity building.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to most of the following expected outcomes:
?	Health policy makers are aware of the healthcare interventions (pharmacological, non- pharmacological or technological interventions; including preventive and rehabilitative actions) that are identified as working best for the specific population groups from the point of view of safety, efficacy, patient outcomes, adherence, quality of life, accessibility, and (cost-) effectiveness.
?	Health professionals have access to and use the improved clinical guidelines on the optimal treatment of patients and prevention of diseases e.g. through vaccines. Considerations made in the guidelines include the harmonisation and standardisation of care for high burden diseases or conditions throughout Europe, as well as possible individualised needs of patients.
?	The scientific and clinical communities make effective use of state-of-the-art information, data, technologies, tools and best practices to develop interventions that are sustainable.

?	Citizens, patients, prescribers, and payers receive more accurate information on available healthcare interventions via ad hoc communication platforms.
?	The scientific and clinical communities make wide use of the newly established open access databases and/or integrate them with existing open access infrastructures for storage and sharing of collected data according to FAIR principles.
Scope: Effective, affordable and accessible healthcare for diverse population groups is challenging and complex. For example, specific needs underlie the delivery of effective preventive actions and therapeutic treatments to a rapidly growing elderly population, often presenting comorbidities and associated poly-pharmacy. The paediatric population, including children born preterm, has also its specific needs in specially adjusted therapeutics and early interventions to address emerging health and developmental problems. Similar to the elderly population, the paediatric population is often excluded from many clinical trials that generate the evidence base for healthcare interventions. Women, including pregnant women, are also often under-represented in clinical studies and access to quality healthcare is frequently inadequate. Other population groups with limited access to quality healthcare and/or under- representation in clinical studies include low-income groups, and refugees. Intersectionality within these groups also needs consideration.
Applicants should address most of the following:

?	Compare the use of currently existing (pharmacological, non-pharmacological and technological) healthcare interventions in specific population groups (or selected subgroups). While there is no restriction on diseases or conditions, preference will be given to proposals focusing on interventions with high public health relevance144.
?	Ensure acceptability and sustainability of the healthcare intervention through early involvement of ?end users? (e.g. patients, care providers) in the design of the study (integrating patient valued outcomes) and, where possible, in the research process including implementation. Additionally, proposals should take into account the diversity of health systems in different regions of Europe to allow large-scale uptake.
?	Consider involving HTA bodies in order to create synergies and accelerate the practical implementation of the results. Where relevant, existing work of EU-funded projects such as EUnetHTA145 should be also taken into account.
?	Consider issues of particular relevance for the target populations, for example, multimorbidity, complex chronic conditions, poly-pharmacy, substance misuse, vaccine efficacy, compliance, age, gender specificities and diseases with high societal burden (including but not limited to e.g. musculoskeletal diseases and mental health disorders). Special consideration should be given to fulfilling all ethical requirements.

144	Interventions addressing diseases or conditions that are particularly frequent, have a high negative impact on the quality of life of the individual and/or are associated with significant costs where savings can be achieved.
145	https://www.eunethta.eu/

?	For the chosen population, assess clinical and safety parameters, as well as health and socio-economic outcomes (e.g. quality of life, patient mortality, (co)morbidity, costs, and performance of the health system). Agreed core outcome sets (COS) should be used as endpoints in conditions where they already exist, in other cases, efforts should be made to agree on such COS. Consider using new instruments and methods for determining the burden of disease and for evaluating the effects of the interventions. Low cost innovations should also be considered.
?	Inclusion of patient organisations and associations of caregivers and other healthcare professionals is recommended.
?	Clinical trials, including pragmatic clinical trials, observational studies, use of existing health data in different study designs, creation of large-scale databases and performing meta-analyses may be considered for this topic. Use of existing data should always be considered to add value, increase quality and increase implementation speed of the study. Regarding databases, sustainability after the proposed action's end also needs to be considered.
?	The proposed research needs to take into account sex and gender aspects.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
The Commission will ensure an overall coordination mechanism between the projects funded under this topic to catalyse the exchange of knowledge, as well as the development and adoption of best practices. Proposals are expected to budget for the attendance to regular meetings. Projects resulting from this call will be invited to share and discuss their case studies amongst themselves and with relevant stakeholders at the EU level, and necessary resources should be allocated to this task.

burden?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	A diverse and comprehensive EU landscape of multi-country adaptive platform trials (i.e. able to study multiple interventions in a disease or condition in a perpetual manner, thus allowing modification to the trial after its initiation without undermining its validity and integrity) that assess vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases, and have the capacity to pivot rapidly in the case of epidemic or pandemic health threats.
?	Innovative and improved design of clinical studies, suited for pandemic preparedness, is available for the clinical research community, taking into account the high safety standards in the European regulatory environment.
?	Trial sites across multiple countries have the capacity to deliver robust clinical evidence in a diverse European population, using harmonised research methods, data collection and analysis.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally. Health threats are expected to arise due to among others, climate change, and thus a need for proactive approaches to ensure timely availability of medical countermeasures during disease outbreaks is anticipated. The conduct of perpetual adaptive platform trials, with the in-built agility to pivot when an epidemic strikes, is key to be prepared for infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.
This topic aims to provide funding to adaptive clinical platform trials that may be implemented routinely outside of an epidemic or pandemic context, but that are designed to be ready for the timely assessment of novel diagnostics, therapeutics or vaccines in the face of an epidemic or pandemic.
Proposals should develop the wide range of elements needed to sustain multi-country adaptive platform trials, including the trial implementation capacity, laboratory analysis capacity, and a harmonised approach to the collection, storage, sharing and analysis of data.
Proposals should ensure timely engagement with regulatory authorities and bodies. Proposals should consider the European regulatory environment and take full use of the European capacity to deliver quality trials, including the possibility for registration of new medical products. Proposals should strengthen the leading role of the EU in clinical research preparedness for future epidemics and pandemics.
The proposals should address the following areas:

?	Development of robust clinical evidence that contributes to the knowledge base for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infectious diseases. Sex, gender, age, ethnicity and socio-economic factors should be taken into account.

?	Known hurdles related to ethical, administrative, regulatory, legal and logistical aspects should be anticipated and addressed to the extent possible, in order to avoid such barriers when the trial needs to pivot in response to an epidemic or pandemic.
?	Engagement with clinical researchers and biostatisticians, to increase capacity for the design and implementation of adaptive platform trials across Europe.
Collaboration and coordination with existing adaptive platform trials in the EU is expected, where relevant, as well as with the coordination mechanisms established under topic HORIZON-HLTH-2023-DISEASE- 3.05 and with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Collaboration and coordination with other organisations and other regional and global initiatives, such as Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking 147 , the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) 148, the European Pandemic Preparedness Partnership and the European Health Preparedness and Emergency Response Authority (HERA) should be envisaged. International cooperation is encouraged.

Scope: Treatments for some high-burden brain disorders are potentially on the horizon150. Consequently, many patients and citizens will want to know if they are eligible for these treatments. For some disorders, a definitive diagnosis is difficult, expensive and time- consuming. Simple blood or other fluid-derived (e.g. saliva, urine, sweat) tests for markers that may indicate early signs of the disorder, and which can be deployed for widespread clinical use are needed.
The brain disorders within the scope of this topic fall under two categories, namely those listed under chapters six and eight of the International Classification of Diseases151. Proposals in the area of mental disorders are encouraged.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:

?	Proposals should aim to validate biomarkers that can reliably confirm early stages of the human brain disorder and guide treatment/ intervention selection152.
?	Proposals should aim to provide evidence supporting the regulatory acceptance of the biomarkers153.
?	Exploitation of existing data, biobanks, registries and cohorts is expected, together with the generation of new key data.

?	Policy makers and funders are informed of the research advances made and consider further support in light of the sustainability of the studies.
?	Patients and caregivers are constructively engaged with the research, which also caters for their needs.
?	Health professionals have access to and use improved clinical guidelines on diagnosis and/or treatment of the condition.
Scope: A number of medical conditions fail to be recognised and/or be correctly diagnosed in a significant proportion of patients. As a consequence they are inadequately treated and often can become a chronic burden for the patient. These medical conditions 156 may be insufficiently researched even though they manifest with high prevalence157 158.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:

?	Proposals should aim at identifying the pathophysiological mechanism (e.g. genetic, cellular and molecular) and potential risk factors (e.g. psychological and environmental) of the medical condition(s) through basic, pre-clinical and/or clinical research. These efforts should underpin the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and/or preventive strategies for the condition.
?	Sex and gender aspects, age, ethnicity, socio-economic, lifestyle and behavioural factors should be taken into consideration. In addition, the emotional and societal long-term effects of these chronic disorders for the affected individuals should be addressed.
?	Where applicable, the development of biomarkers and other technologies for diagnosis, monitoring in patients, and stratification of patient groups.
?	Where applicable, the development of clinically relevant, (non-)human model systems that can complement clinical investigations.
?	Exploitation of existing data, biobanks, registries and cohorts is expected, together with the generation of new (e.g. genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) data.
?	To enable sharing of samples, quality data and advanced analytical tools, it is encouraged to make use of existing infrastructures developed at the European 159 or national level.


156	High-burden medical conditions could for instance include those that are either life-threatening or lead to chronic invalidity or a severely reduced quality of life.
157	Examples of medical conditions include Lyme disease, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and back pain. This topic excludes rare diseases.
158	The European Commission is commissioning an independent scoping study to help identify under- researched high-burden medical conditions and define the type of research and/or research priorities to better address the different needs of patients with these conditions.
159	A variety of infrastructures have been developed at European level and include, for example, the BBMRI-ERIC research infrastructure for biobanking, while others are being developed like the ?Federated European infrastructure for genomics data?.

?	Inclusion of patients or patient organisations in the research is strongly encouraged, to ensure that their views are considered.
?	SME participation is strongly encouraged.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a fragmented research landscape, with substantial room for efficiency gains in the development of the highly needed evidence to guide policy actions when facing an emergency. The European partnership for pandemic preparedness is working to improve the EU?s preparedness to predict and respond to emerging infectious health threats by better coordinating funding for research and innovation at EU, national (and regional) level towards common objectives and an agreed Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. Such a partnership contributes to building a coherent European Research Area (ERA), enabling Member States, Associated Countries and the European Commission to rapidly and jointly support research and innovation in pandemic preparedness.
The Partnership is expected to continue to build on existing pandemic preparedness networks, and work in synergy with the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).

Proposals should foresee administrative and technical support through a secretariat to maintain and support the European partnership on pandemic preparedness.
Proposals should include all of the following activities:

?	Provide an efficient secretariat for the European partnership for pandemic preparedness
?	Provide administrative and organisational support to the Members in the European partnership for pandemic preparedness;
?	Provide strong scientific support on topics requested by the GloPID-R Chairs, scientific advisors or (working) groups;
?	Actively engage with relevant stakeholders and initiatives in the area of pandemic preparedness, ensuring collaboration and coordination, and avoiding duplication; e.g. the Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking, GloPID-R, WHO R&D blueprint, ACT- Accelerator, etc.;
?	Implement strong communication and dissemination activities at EU level and in Member States and Associated Countries, on the purpose, activities and outputs of the European partnership for pandemic preparedness, both outside and during epidemic/pandemic episodes;
?	Establish coordination and collaboration with relevant initiatives related to pandemic preparedness such as HERA to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps;
?	As relevant, apply a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary One Health approach;
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The scientific and clinical communities have an increased knowledge on viruses with epidemic potential and in particular a better understanding of pathogen?host interactions for the targeted development of vaccines and inhibitors for the prevention of viral infection and the viral transmission during pathogenesis.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment for emerging and re-emerging infections in the context of epidemic and pandemic preparedness.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to experimental vaccine candidates and candidates that inhibit cellular uptake of viruses against emerging or re-emerging viral infections for further clinical investigation.
A diverse and robust development pipeline of vaccine candidates and candidates that inhibit cellular uptake of viruses is available to fight emerging and re-emerging viral infections, increasing therapeutic options for clinical deployment in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally. Viral disease emergence is expected to accelerate due to among other factors, climate change, and thus a proactive approach to the development of vaccines and inhibitors for the cellular uptake of viruses in preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks is needed. The availability of vaccines and candidates that inhibit cellular uptake of viruses would provide a critical preparedness measure against future health threats, due to infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.
Proposals should follow innovative approaches to characterize host-pathogen interactions with a view to inhibit viral replication, viral proteases, viral exit strategies and to develop

therapeutic antibodies and vaccines that target viruses with high epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU. Proposals should focus on viruses identified by HERA162 and those causing diseases that are in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO)163, such as Hendra and Nipah virus, Lassa virus, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Ebola virus, Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, Zika virus, West Nile fever virus and Chikungunya virus. In order to ensure complementarity to ongoing research, proposals addressing influenza and coronaviruses are not in scope. Proposal should take into account sex and gender aspects.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global therapeutic research and development pipeline for emerging and re-emerging viral infections, and to strengthen the current leading role of the EU in therapeutic research and development, and therefore contributing to the work of the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
Proposals should address several of the following areas:

?	Identification and characterisation of receptors on the host cell that enable the docking and internalisation of a virus with a particular emphasis on the diversity of cellular entry receptors and tissue specificity.
?	Identification and characterisation of viral surface proteins that are capable of interacting with host target cells.
?	Characterisation of the mechanism of viral uptake in the host cell with regard to the topology and the dynamics of the host receptor ? virus ligand interaction.
?	Identification of receptor and ligand (sub)units that could be targeted by preventive or therapeutic intervention.
Proposals could consider the inclusion of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) research infrastructure (Nanobiotechnology laboratory) for biophysical characterization of recombinant proteins, antigens and therapeutic antibodies, and its expertise at the interface between the research activities and regulatory aspects. In that respect, the JRC will consider collaborating with any successful proposal and this collaboration, when relevant, should be established after the proposal?s approval.
Applicants envisaging including clinical studies are strongly encouraged to provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system. See definition of clinical studies in the introduction to this work programme part.",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The EU?s response to fight the rise of AMR is improved and the EU is reinforced as an internationally recognised driver of research and innovation on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) thereby substantially contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals related to AMR;
?	EU and national agencies, the scientific communities, policy makers and funders enhance their collaboration and coordination for a strengthened ?One Health (OH) approach to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR)? forming a strong and structured ecosystem with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;
?	Research funders, policy makers, relevant agencies and authorities, and the research community are in a position to close the current gaps and break existing silos on AMR in accordance with the European One Health Action Plan against AMR166;
?	Research funders align, adopt and implement their research policies and activities allowing for the optimal generation of novel solutions to prevent and treat infectious diseases affected by AMR, improved surveillance and diagnosis and control of the spread of resistant microorganisms, testing and validation of such solutions and facilitating their uptake or implementation responding to the needs to reduce the burden of AMR;
?	The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised environment for OH AMR substantially contributing to global cooperation and coordination by expanding beyond Europe;
?	The research community at large benefit from and use an improved comprehensive knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information infrastructures to improve translational research.
Scope: The partnership shall contribute to the priorities set in the European One Health Action plan to fight AMR that provides a European framework with actions focused on areas with the highest added value for Member States, including boosting research development and innovation.
In this, the European partnership on One Health AMR should allow coordinating, aligning of activities and funding among countries in the EU and beyond, as well as facilitating national coherence between different services/ministries with responsibility for the various aspects of AMR and sectors involved (e.g. human and animal health, agriculture, environment, innovation).


166	https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2020-01/amr_2017_action-plan_0.pdf

This partnership should also contribute to achieving the objectives of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe167, in terms of fulfilling unmet medical needs on AMR and ensuring that the benefits of innovation reach patients in the EU, and support the objectives of the new EU4Health Programme168.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, citizens, healthcare institutions, innovators, policy makers), the Partnership will create a critical mass of resources and implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA).
The co-funded European Partnership on One Health antimicrobial resistance should be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from coordinating transnational research efforts to other activities such as coordination and networking activities, capacity building programmes, brokerage and mobility programmes, work on research infrastructures and resources, including training and dissemination activities.
The implementation of the future European Partnership for OH AMR should contribute to build a European Research and Innovation Area (ERA) to rapidly and jointly support research and innovation in the fight against AMR.
It should be structured along the following 3 main objectives:

1.	Collaboration and alignment of Research and Innovation agendas on OH AMR

The Partnership should mobilise and link key AMR stakeholders, encompassing the human, veterinary, agricultural and environmental disciplines and including a broad spectrum of pathogens, bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, through a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary one health approach. It should provide a framework to close the current knowledge gaps and break existing silos in the AMR research landscape, facilitating the integration of national and international scientific and policy communities with industry and the civil society.
For this, the partnership could support, although no limited to, the following activities:

?	Joint strategic programming and global coordination of research and innovation through an agreed One Health AMR SRIA (covering the scientific areas Therapeutics, Surveillance, Diagnostics, Transmission, Prevention and Intervention, environment and social behavioural science).
?	Target research and innovation efforts to actual needs (challenge-driven) of policymakers and stakeholders.
?	Create a transnational system that supports collaboration between EU, MS and international initiatives.
2.	Boost Research and Innovation

168	https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2021.107.01.0001.01.ENG

The Partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent, widening the engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.
For this, the partnership could support, although no limited to, the following activities:

?	Support excellent OH AMR research and development of new prevention methods, interventions, treatments and diagnostics through annual joint transnational research calls and research network calls.
?	Develop new tools and instruments to support research and innovation.
?	Support networking, training and mobility of researchers.
?	Facilitate sharing and use of data and research infrastructure.
3.	Develop solutions

?	Facilitate translation of scientific knowledge into innovations solutions
?	Connect, merge and align dissemination of outputs with other initiatives to support evidence-based policy in whole One Health domain
?	Societal engagement by bridging science to society creating awareness of AMR challenges, value creation, support the wellbeing of citizens and sustainability of the environment
The partnership shall also:

Strengthen the OH AMR ecosystem with integrating activities engaging key actors for AMR encompassing the field of human, veterinary and environmental disciplines and the broad spectrum of pathogens, including fungi and viruses.
Implement collaborative activities with International Organisations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the G7 and G20 fora, and the global AMR R&D Hub, with the aim to avoid duplication of efforts. International cooperation is encouraged also with low- and middle-income countries where AMR is highly prevalent and prone to spread to Europe.
Establish robust communication and effective information exchange between diverse scientific disciplines and among multiple sectors of the society (as patients, clinicians, veterinarians, pharmacists, food producers, pharmaceutical industry, policy makers and researchers (including those working in the social sciences and humanities).
The Partnership?s governance structure should engage upfront the relevant actors to coordinate, steer and frame the research and innovation activities, facilitate the use and uptake of the results and contribute to a science-based communication of the risk of spread of AMR. The Partnership?s governance and operational structures should also foster a dialogue on sustainability, beyond funding from EU research and innovation framework programmes.

The governance should involve key stakeholders, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, and innovation owners.
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to those countries wishing to join.
The Partnership should build on, be complementary to and go beyond the existing initiative JPIAMR169.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other Horizon Europe partnerships (institutionalized and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on ?Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe?170 as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. The proposal should also consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health. The Partnership should align with EU- wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data171.
Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and non-European institutions and experts may be considered. Participation of third countries is encouraged. Their commitments to the Partnership would not be eligible for the calculation of EU funding. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives.
When defining calls for proposals, this Partnership needs to consider if to require the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities",
HORIZON-HLTH-2023-CARE-04-01, Maintaining access to regular health and care services in case of cross-border emergencies,4/13/2023,RIA,1/12/2023,,,4.00 to 6.00-4,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 4 ?Ensuring access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim

for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:
?	Decision- and policy makers have access to modelling tools and foresight studies (including cost studies on the non-access to health and care services) on health and care systems 177 for anticipating regular 178 and unplanned health and care demand during large-scale cross-border emergencies179.
?	Decision- and policy makers and health and care providers can better facilitate and manage access to regular health and care delivery during cross-border emergencies.
?	Decision- and policy makers and health and care providers avail of management frameworks including organisational models for handling unplanned health and care demand linked to cross-border emergencies, while maintaining necessary regular health and care provision.
?	Health and care professionals have access to training on how to deliver regular health and care services (including by means such as telemedicine) during cross-border health emergencies.
?	Health and care professionals, citizens and patients access advanced digital tools enabling managed access to regular health and care services, complemented by other modes of health and care delivery (e.g., telemedicine, self-care, prioritised care).
?	Patients can be involved in the co-design and co-production of health and care delivery models during cross-border emergencies and can benefit from better access to regular health and care services during such periods.
?	Health and care providers and health and care professionals have access to knowledge and data on, and innovative solutions to combat, decreasing demand for regular health and care services resulting from an ongoing emergency (e.g. patients are avoiding visits to hospitals because they are worried about additional infections or do not want to add extra burden on the health and care systems).
Scope: Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe, as well as globally, health and care systems have been facing unprecedented challenges. Many systems were overwhelmed and fell short on available supplies, staff, and critical infrastructure. Beyond the


177	?Health and care systems? implies a broader notion than ?health systems? or ?healthcare systems? notably encompassing all parts of health systems and health related parts of social care systems.
178	Regular care refers to the care that would be expected to be needed and delivered under normal circumstances. This includes all types of morbidities (chronic diseases, mental health disorders, trauma care etc.) and also all parts of the health and care systems (prevention, follow-up, long-term care, primary care, both in- and out hospital care etc.), as well as related support services such as laboratories.
179	Cross-border emergency refers to an emergent situation that spreads or entails a significant risk of spreading across the national borders of Member States and Associated Countries, and which may necessitate coordination at Union level in order to ensure a high level of human health protection (Art. 2(1) Regulation on serious cross-border threats to health). In this topic, only emergency situations with a high impact on health systems are included.

initial challenges posed by the pandemic, its prolonged duration has strained health and care facilities and providers, and had a negative impact on regular health and care provision. Disruptions in routine and non-emergency medical care access and delivery have been observed. It is hence timely to take stock and identify lessons for maintaining care delivery.
Another recent emergency situation that has had a great impact on health and care systems is the war in Ukraine and the resulting migration to bordering countries. Also under these circumstances, it is important to have the right tools for maintaining access to regular health and care services, while also accommodating the more urgent needs of migrants, for example.
The goal is to be better prepared for the multiple challenges faced by health and care systems during emergencies, and ensure that necessary access to regular health and care services can be maintained.
Proposals for research and innovation should focus on health and care systems, and actions are expected to address several of the following:
?	Analysis and evaluation of different epidemics or other emergencies response measures in Member States and Associated Countries aimed at maintaining access to regular health and care services. Cost studies on not maintaining access to health and care services during cross-border emergencies.
?	Development of innovative tools and models that maintain access to regular health and care services during cross-border emergencies ? for example developing modelling and foresight tools to assess and anticipate impact of cross-border emergencies on regular health and care delivery; developing novel technical solutions or organizational management models, including training, for regular care delivery in future cross-border emergencies; demonstrating applicability of novel modelling tools, management frameworks and organisational models in selected areas of regular health and care services (e.g. chronic diseases, mental health disorders, trauma care).
?	Development and implementation of digital tools and of effective communication strategies based on digital health literacy studies ? for example developing, implementing and generating evidence of benefit of novel digital systems connecting health and care professionals, citizens and patients at-scale, helping maintain access to health and care services during emergencies (including but not limited to smart appointment management, chronic disease self-management applications, primary care and/or referral caseload prioritisation and management incl. triage, increasing clinical practice efficiency, management of health care professionals? caseload, integrated telecare suites complemented by new computational methods such as AI/machine learning, etc.).
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Interdisciplinary research is thus encouraged,

including the involvement of SSH disciplines considered essential for health and care planning and delivery in different social contexts and for the evaluation of health economical aspects.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
Synergies should be sought with potentially complementary research initiatives, data stewards, custodians and research infrastructures such as the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure and the future European co-funded partnerships180, such as the partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems (THCS).
Successful projects need to adequately link and integrate with relevant EU health policy efforts towards a European Health Data Space (EHDS)181 and the nascent Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA)182.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:
?	Health and care workers receive support (including mental health support), access to tools and guidance that enhances their wellbeing and ability to adapt to changing working conditions, as a result of new technologies, new work models or unexpected adverse events, including during public health emergencies and when under ethical stress.
?	Decision- and policymakers, employers and social partners in the health and care sectors183 have knowledge of the specific risks for the resilience, mental health and well- being of health and care professionals and informal carers. They have access to solutions (regulatory, organisational, technological, educational, HR, health services) to prevent and manage them, based on the integrated development of work processes and wellbeing at work and on the study of effects of clustered work stressors on work ability and recovery from work.
?	Funders of health and care provision have access to evidence, novel approaches and cost-effective recommendations for interventions supporting the mental health and well- being of health and care workers at individual, organisation and sector levels.
?	Policy makers cooperate with relevant stakeholders, including health and care professionals associations and social partners to foster specific solutions to improve resilience and well-being of health workers and carers including informal carers184, and fight the accumulation of stressors.
Scope: A resilient workforce in the health and care sectors is essential for the sustainability and prosperity of our societies. However, careers in the health and care sector can be physically and mentally taxing by submitting health professionals and carers to psychosocial risks (for example heavy workload, stressful working conditions, risk of exposure to

184	OECD definition: ?Informal carers are defined as people providing any help to older family members, friends and people in their social network, living inside or outside of their household, who require help with everyday tasks.?

infectious agents, precariousness, ethical stress etc.). Many health professionals and carers also commute to work or have migrated to work in a new country. This adds to the struggle of health and care systems to attract new people to their workforce, but also to maintain the ones already working. A combination of factors such as changes in work organisation, budgetary and administrative pressures faced by health and care systems, systemic shortages of health professionals, precarious working conditions, structural inequalities and leaps in technological innovation may leave health and care workers with feelings of helplessness, physical or mental vulnerability or moral injury.
Technological innovations (including digitisation, big data and artificial intelligence applications) provide opportunities for a more efficient provision of health and care services, and for lightening the workload of health and care workers. However, they also create new risks, potentially affecting the mental wellbeing of the workforce. For example, new skills, requirements, new organisational models, performance monitoring by algorithms, lack of control or accountability in workplace decisions, ethical questions, are elements that can increase stress and hamper the ability of health and care workers to function in their jobs on a daily basis.
The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on health and care workers? resilience and exacerbated mental health issues that were already a problem pre-pandemic, ranging from anxiety due to increased workload to burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder. Informal carers suffer from similar stress, potentially caused by different factors, such as the need to provide care which keeps them away from employment and puts them at an increased risk of poverty. Lack of acknowledgement that one?s mental health is deteriorating, barriers to seeking help or the stigma that still surrounds mental illness may impede people from addressing such problems early enough. Different socio-economic groups are affected to different extents: in emerging virus outbreaks prior to the COVID-19 pandemic lower educational level among other things was associated with higher risk for adverse psychological outcomes among health workers185.
Successful applicants must address several of the following activities:

?	Collect and analyse new evidence and data generation ? on occupation-specific factors building the resilience, mental health well-being of health and care workers, or informal carers. Where appropriate, evidence should be gathered and analysed on the interplay of such factors with non-occupation specific factors (e.g. genetic, social etc.). Where relevant, such evidence should be target-group specific, considering variation of challenges for professionals working in various settings (primary care, hospitals, residential care institutions, disadvantaged geographic locations).
?	Develop action-oriented recommendations to policymakers, employers, social partners and relevant civil society organisations at the appropriate levels (EU, national, regional, local) based on evidence generated by the proposed action. Such recommendations should suggest (cost-)effective policy interventions or elements for further research

185	https://ec.europa.eu/health/system/files/2021-10/028_mental-health_workforce_en_0.pdf

aiming to promote the resilience, mental health and well-being of health and care workers. They should be based on cost-benefit studies and ex-ante evaluations of proposed interventions.
?	Develop, or identify, innovative solutions (including digitally enabled ones), organisational models and management approaches to support health policymakers, employers and formal or informal health and care workers in promoting resilience, mental health and well-being in the workplace.
?	Develop financing and resource allocation models to ensure access to support and mental health services for health and care workers and informal carers.
?	Carry out testing and validation activities for new or improved solutions186 improving conditions for health and care workers or informal carers according to specific factors influencing their mental well-being.
Applicants can select one or more worker groups or informal carers as target of R&I activities, based on credible scientific criteria.
This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, health and care professionals associations and (informal) carers associations, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.
With women making up over 70% of EU health care professionals and employees in the care sector and a great part of informal carers, an appropriate gender approach is essential in research and policy interventions, to prevent or mitigate workplace inequalities and imbalances. Researchers and policymakers should also take into account the inclusion dimension, as a significant share of health professionals or care workers typically come from minority groups, whether through declared or undeclared work.
Applicants should consider potential synergies and avoid overlaps with ongoing calls or actions funded under EU or national programmes for example the future cofunded partnership on Transforming Health and Care Systems (THCS).
Proposals are encouraged to take into account, when relevant, the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work (2021-2027) 187 , the report on mental health 188 and most

environmentally sustainable, what the possible costs of that are (today and future) and where improvements are possible with maintained or improved quality of care (optimal patient safety not being jeopardised) and possible investments needed.
?	Policy and decision makers and providers of health and care services have access to innovative solutions, organisational models (including financing models), and guidelines and recommendations that reduce the pollution and carbon emissions stemming from health and care systems, so that health and care provision can become more sustainable and cost-effective while maintaining or improving quality of care thanks to the reduction of energy and materials use, decreased carbon emissions, reduced waste and discharges, and efficient resource management.
?	Monitoring and reporting of carbon emissions and pollution is mainstreamed through a life-cycle approach and with standard methods in the health and care systems.
Scope: The health care sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions190, and generates significant demands for energy and materials, as well as dangerous waste streams that may cause air, soil and water pollution. At the same time, health and care provision generally experiences less pressure to decarbonise and improve its circularity than other sectors of the economy. With the European Green Deal, the EU commits to reducing net greenhouse gas emission by at least 55% by 2030, and to reach no net emissions by 2050, and the health and care systems are not exempt. Research and innovation can support by ensuring a smooth transformation while maintaining or improving quality of health and care services.
Health and care systems are undergoing structural changes, for example by strengthening primary care and community-based care, strengthening digitalisation and making sure patients are treated or cared for at the most efficient level. This offers the possibility to connect structural changes with anenvironmental transformation.
During COP26, 18 countries (including two EU Member States) have committed to cutting all carbon emissions from their health systems over the next 10 to 30 years and during the same period in total fifty countries (including six EU Member States) have committed to creating climate resilient, low carbon, sustainable health systems.
In February 2022, the WHO published a report on the waste that had been generated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, even more emphasising the need to improve waste management systems of the health and care systems 191 . The report states that 30% of healthcare facilities word-wide, and 60% in the least developed countries, are not fit to handle the waste generated even when not taking the extra waste generated by the pandemic into account. Not only does this pose environmental risks such as water and air pollution, but it also poses a risk to health workers? safety by increasing the risk of being exposed to stick injuries, burns and pathogenic microorganisms.

Research and innovation activities under this topic should be specific to health and care sectors. They should include cost studies when relevant (environmental impacts and benefits to be quantified through the life cycle thinking approach (e.g. LCA/SLCA), to be effectively implemented in line with the European Green Deal and the Zero Pollution Action Plan) and piloting research results onsite in hospitals or other care settings while generating accessible knowledge could be included. Apart from that, successful proposals should address several of the following:
?	Research and innovative solutions for decarbonisation of hospitals and other care providers: improvements in new and existing building stock, decarbonisation of energy supply to premises, reduction in energy demand of hospital sites and other care facilities (for example heating and cooling, hot water, laundry, cooking, transport systems).
?	Research and innovative solutions for increased circularity of hospitals or other care providers that integrate the zero-pollution ambition: such as solutions to reduce waste, improved waste management practices (with a possible focus on water effluents and Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)), increased circularity (for example sustainable use of linen).
?	Research and innovative solutions for decarbonisation and greening of supply chains and material inflows: reduction of single-use plastics, substitution of anaesthetic gases and inhalers with high global warming potentials (GWPs), substitution of conventional pharmaceuticals with green(er) alternatives, low-carbon supply chains of food, waste reduction, management models on for example prescription of pharmaceuticals.

?	Citizens, patients and healthcare professionals have a better knowledge of personalised medicine and are better involved in its implementation;

?	Stakeholders cooperate better and establish a network of national and regional knowledge hubs for personalised medicine.
Scope: Personalised medicine is a medical model using characterisation of individuals' phenotypes and genotypes (e.g. molecular profiling, medical imaging and lifestyle data) for tailoring the right health strategy. Personalized medicine shows great promise and has already led to ground-breaking developments in treatment of many diseases. Through this approach, better health outcomes can be achieved by preventing disease and providing patient-centred care tailored to the needs of citizens. There have been important investments in personalised medicine over the last decades. However, producing knowledge, translating it into clinical applications and accelerating innovation uptake are complex, time-consuming and involve multiple stakeholders. There is a need to facilitate the uptake of health technology innovations and ensure a rapid and effective implementation of personalised medicine on a larger scale in Europe. To this end, the creation of a research and innovation (R&I) partnership with a focus on personalised medicine represents a unique strategic opportunity to bring together stakeholders, create synergies, coordinate R&I actions and leverage the efforts to accelerate the evolution of healthcare toward personalised medicine.
The partnership should build on knowledge gained from supportive initiatives like the International Consortium of Personalised Medicine (ICPerMed), the European Research Area Network for Personalised Medicine (ERA-PerMed), several Coordination and Support Actions (CSAs) funded by the EC under Horizon 2020, the one million genomes initiative as well as with an increasing number of associated and related initiatives, research infrastructures and capacities in Europe and beyond.
The partnership will facilitate exchange of information and good practices among countries, provide robust guidance and tools, will network institutional stakeholders and involve regional ecosystems. It should stimulate service, policy and organisational innovations, as well as the integration of biomedical and technological innovations for the benefit of the European citizens and the European industry. The partnership should bring together a broad range of actors with a common vision of future personalised medicine. Through the objectives of Horizon Europe, the partnership should contribute to achieving the following European Commission priorities:
?	Promoting our European way of life
?	An economy that works for people
?	A Europe fit for the digital age
?	A European green deal
The partnership will also contribute to priorities of the ?Communication on effective, accessible and resilient health systems? (COM(2014) 215 final), the ?Communication on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market;

empowering citizens and building a healthier society? (COM(2018) 233 final) and the Europe's Beating Cancer Plan.
Thanks to its capacity to bring together different stakeholders (e.g. research funders, health authorities, healthcare institutions, innovators, policy makers), to create a critical mass of resources and to implement a long-term Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), the partnership will address the following objectives:
?	Putting Europe at the forefront of research and innovation through the support of multidisciplinary actions open to international cooperation;
?	Establishing a European national and regional network of research and innovation systems dedicated to personalised medicine;
?	Translating basic research into clinical applications that make a difference for patients, their families and healthcare professionals;
?	Filling scientific knowledge gaps, producing evidence and developing guidance and tools in priority areas for the development and the deployment of personalised medicine;
?	Integrating big data and digital health solutions in research and personalised healthcare;
?	Strengthening the European healthcare industry and accelerating the uptake of personalised medicine solutions;
?	Developing appropriate ecosystems for the implementation of successful personalised medicine approaches and a swift uptake of relevant innovations by healthcare systems;
?	Providing socio-economic evidence of the feasibility of personalised medicine approaches for its uptake by sustainable healthcare systems;
?	Improving health outcomes for citizen and patients and ensuring a wide access to advanced personalised medicine intervention approaches to all.
The European Partnership for Personalised Medicine198 will be implemented through a joint programme of activities ranging from research to coordination and networking activities, including training, demonstration, piloting and dissemination activities, to be structured along the following main building blocks:
?	Joint implementation of the SRIA;
?	Joint annual calls for R&I activities, applied R&I, pilots;
?	Capacity building activities;
?	Activities to enhance the skills of the relevant personalised medicine workforce, and improve citizen relevant awareness and literacy;

198	More information on the planned European Partnerships is available on the Horizon Europe Webpage:

?	Deployment activities through pilots, innovation procurements and financial support mechanisms,
?	Flanking measures.
The Partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to those countries wanting to join. It should include the following actors:
?	Ministries in charge of R&I policy, as well as national and regional R&I and technology funding agencies and foundations;
?	Ministries in charge of health and care policy, as well as national and regional healthcare authorities, organisations and providers.
The Partnership may also encourage engagement with other relevant Ministries and will involve other key actors from civil society and end-users, research and innovation community, innovation owners, healthcare systems owners/organisers and healthcare agencies.
The Partnership?s governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should leave sufficient space for involving the key stakeholders, including but not limited to R&I community, patients and citizens, healthcare professionals, formal and informal care organisations, and innovation owners.
Financial commitments and in-kind contributions are expected to be provided for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination.
To encourage national coordination and avoid an excess of grant signatories it is recommended to limit their number to two per country. However, in duly justified cases this number could differ, including for countries with decentralised administration to allow for participation of regional authorities in charge of R&I policy and health and care policy.
To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the Partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with other European partnerships and missions as set out in the working document on ?Coherence and Synergies of existing and candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe?199 as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health, DEP, ESF+, ERDF, InvestEU, RRF and TSI.
The Partnership should align with EU-wide initiatives on open access and FAIR data200.


199
200	FAIR data are data, which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.

Cooperation with international organisations, and non-European institutions and experts should be considered. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the primary activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives",

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to several of the following expected outcomes:
?	Decision- and policy makers, service providers, and health and care workers have better availability to and make use of knowledge on barriers to access to health and care services 204 experienced by people in vulnerable situations and at risk of stigma or discrimination (from now on referred to as people in vulnerable situations)205.
?	Decision- and policy makers, providers and health and care workers have access to innovative solutions to promote and improve access to health and care services for people in vulnerable situations.



203	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf
204	?Health and care systems? implies a broader notion than ?health systems? or ?healthcare systems? notably encompassing all parts of health systems and health related parts of social care systems.
205	Groups of people and/or patients vulnerable from a social, financial, or health perspective, or at risk of discrimination, such as migrants, Roma people, trans and intersex people, specific age and gender groups (that intersects with other aspects of vulnerability, such as elderly women), indigenous people, homeless people, people in poverty or at risk of poverty, people with disabilities or patients with complex conditions.

?	Decision- and policy makers and providers have access to reliable quantitative data on health inequalities in access to health and care services for people in vulnerable situations.
?	People in vulnerable situations are better equipped in terms of health and digital literacy, knowledge about their rights etc. when it comes to access to health and care services.
?	People in vulnerable situations are involved in the design and implementation of research and innovation activities concerning access to health and care services.
Scope: Equal and needs-based access to health and care services are important values of the EU, as well as central principles within the Member States (for example Art. 3 TFU, 2006 Council Conclusions on Common values and principles in European Union Health Systems, European Pillar of social rights). At the same time, plenty of evidence indicates that there is unmet need for health and care services. Although financial barriers are an important part of the explanation206, it is also evident that even in countries where co-payment is low or even zero, access to health and care services differs between groups. Certain groups are more at risk of not accessing all the health and care services they need, depending among other factors, on their socio-economic and legal status, age, sex and gender identity, (dis)ability, ethnicity and geographical location.
For example, the life expectancy for the Roma people ? the largest ethnic minority in the EU
? is on average ten years shorter than the general population. This is because, due to poor socio-economic conditions and ethnic segregation, many Roma people live in enclaves where equal opportunities to services including infrastructure are lacking. Due to these inequalities that are also rooted in antigypsysim207, Roma are facing much greater difficulties accessing and receiving standard health and care services including prevention compared to other citizens208.
There are significant health inequalities between the LGBTIQ community and the population as a whole. One part of the explanation is reluctance to seek health and care services because they have experienced or fear hostile reactions. Trans- and intersex people still struggle to access quality and affordable medication and care, both related to general health services and specific health care relating to transition, such as a lack of relevant medication or surgical procedures209.
Compared to men, older women have a higher poverty risk also due to lower pay and lower pensions. They face a higher risk to live longer in poorer health, so their overall need for

206	See for example OECD Health at a glance 2021.
207	Antigypsyism (a form of racism against Roma) is a historically rooted structural phenomenon that appears at institutional, social and interpersonal levels.
208	The EU Roma strategic framework for equality, inclusion and participation sets up the ambitious goal to lessen the life expectancy gap and ensure that by 2030 Roma women and men live 5 years longer. https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/eu_roma_strategic_framework_for_equality_inclusion_and_ participation_for_2020_-_2030_0.pdf
209	stateofart_report_en.pdf (europa.eu) The Commission?s Health4LGBTI project concluded that trans and intersex-focused research is needed that addresses health inequalities and healthcare.

health and especially care services is therefore higher210. People living in difficult socio- economic situations, such as homeless people or people at the risk of poverty may experience similar issues. For migrants and refugees, uncertain legal status, fear of public authorities, or language difficulties may cause additional barriers to seeking adequate health and care services.
Whilst factors outside the health and care sector also have an impact on people?s access to health and care services, health and care systems can influence and facilitate access through accessibility, costs, referrals and attitudes.
Another aspect concerns access to data regarding certain groups. Whereas data on access to health and care when it comes to factors related to socio-economic characteristics, geographical barriers, sex, and age is more accessible, data on people in vulnerable situations (often due to the problem of sensitivity of data) is often less accessible, contributing to making the situation of these groups less visible.
Activities under this call should focus on groups that are in vulnerable situations from a social, financial or health perspective, or at risk of discrimination, such as migrants, Roma people, trans and intersex people, specific age and gender groups (that intersects with other aspects of vulnerability, such as elderly women), indigenous people, homeless people, people in poverty or at risk of poverty, people with disabilities or patients with complex conditions. Where relevant, activities should use intersectional approaches to consider, inter alia, socioeconomic factors, geography, citizenship, age, sex and gender identity, and ethnicity.
Next to the above-mentioned, research and innovation activities under this topic should address several of the following:
?	Different types of barriers - different barriers to study could be financial, geographic, social, marginalisation and discrimination. When relevant, health and digital literacy aspects should be analysed. The selection of factors should be context specific as groups suffering from access barriers vary a lot across EU countries and at subnational level. The principle of needs-based health and care should be taken into account.
?	Access to what? ? for example: what part of the health and care system (from prevention, primary care and long-term care to tertiary care, any specific services, e.g. mental care) do different groups have access to? Is integrated care provided for these groups taking into account their particular needs? How much health and care services do different groups access?
?	Solutions - What measures are needed to counter inequalities in health and care access and make sure that vulnerable groups access health and care services and that access is based on needs (measures to educate, support and empower vulnerable groups can be included here)? What are the costs, at different levels, to develop these solutions? Piloting of measures could be included. Community-based and/or co-created initiatives

and peer-support approaches: what works and how can these be supported, sustained and/or integrated in the wider service landscape.
?	Better data ? improving access and quality of data will contribute to identify people in vulnerable situations? health needs and implement targeted measures corresponding to the challenges that each group experiences. The data could for example explore effectiveness of provided care (metrics helping to assess if provided care addresses the root causes of inequalities) or new valid methodologies to identify the unmet health related needs of people in vulnerable situations. Quantitative and qualitative data on inequalities in prevention, prevalence and treatment of different morbidities.
?	Cost analyses - The cost of inequalities in access to health and care services: Quantitatively and/or qualitatively measure the negative impact on not taking measures for helping people in vulnerable situations have access to health and care services including prevention.
Proposals are expected to involve the people/groups studied in the design and implementation of the research and innovation activities and where relevant service providers and other stakeholders.

?	Citizens? trust in the sharing and re-use of health data for research and healthcare increases due to the application of advanced technologies and data governance preserving data privacy and security.
Scope: Health data bear vast information potential in many disease areas, to significantly improve the outcomes and efficiency of healthcare delivery, unlock new research and innovation avenues, and inform public health policy across Europe. There is a huge need of integration, use and deployment of health data from multiple sources for effectively addressing the challenges of medical research underpinning diagnostics, therapy guidance and implementation decisions on new therapies. Such integration requires linking data of different types, disease areas and provenance which are scattered in several repositories and databases across Europe.

This topic aims to support proposals focusing on the integration of health data from multiple sources (e.g. electronic health records, genomics, medical imaging, laboratory and diagnostic results, pathogen data, public health registries and other clinical research data) by linking real- world and clinical research data. The data integration should be exemplified in several use- cases, i.e. well-justified groups of diseases (excluding cancer), within and/or across medical domains, and pave the way towards improved health outcomes. At least one of those use cases should build on the use of whole genome sequence data.
The consortium should ensure wide European coverage, contributing significantly to health data standardisation, while catering for the diversity of health data sources.
To enhance synergies and avoid overlaps of activities, the proposals are expected to align with and complement the relevant European initiatives, in particular the European Health Data Space (EHDS), the 1+Million Genomes initiative (1+MG) and the European Open Science Cloud.
The applicants have to demonstrate that the necessary data sources are, or will be, effectively, timely and legally available for the proposed research activities.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Identification of the barriers to health data integration and access as needed for the selected use cases, and of specific existing tools, technological solutions and coordination and standardisation agreements addressing those barriers. Issues to be covered include semantic ontologies, data standards and formats, data quality, data storage, management and access modalities, as well as enhanced findability of relevant datasets through improved metadata standards and data catalogues.
?	New approaches to assemble large, easily findable and lawfully accessible high-quality datasets integrating multiple types of health data leading to improved clinical outcomes (e.g. new care solutions, personalised disease management, advanced diagnostic tools), taking into account data FAIRification and inter-operability needs.
?	New techniques, support tools, mechanisms and modalities to enable GDPR compliant access to sensitive personal data, including genomics, allowing for their re-use across borders and integration of different types of data relevant to human health. Legal and ethical frameworks should duly consider the heterogeneity in national and sectorial rules and procedures for data access and re-use.
?	Data management approaches for cross-border distributed data storage and processing, enabling remote collaboration, electronic consent management, data provenance tracking, and scalability of data management resources, ensuring data privacy and security, and resulting in robust support to advanced, innovative clinical workflows. Joint data governance is expected to be piloted among several clinical centres across Europe.

Development of a data analytics platform applying distributed learning and artificial intelligence approaches to query and aggregate efficiently, effectively and securely data from multiple sources for multiple use cases (groups of diseases), to monitor patients' health status, analyse causal inference, support diagnosis and health policy-makers, and establish recommendations for patients and other stakeholders.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data principles and build on existing and justified tools and harmonisation efforts, such as widely used standards for encoding the different types of health data and inter-operability for cross-sector collaborations. Also the data collection, management and/or modelling should build on ongoing EU and international efforts to avoid possible duplication of efforts and fragmentation. In particular, projects are expected to take into account the forthcoming legislation on the EHDS, so as to align, where possible, project activities with pertinent EHDS infrastructure efforts that provide for the secondary use of health data as regards e.g. cross-border access to data, cross-border infrastructures, data quality and utility labelling. The achievements of the relevant past and ongoing EU-funded projects and initiatives, and good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, should be duly considered and used. Close involvement of patients and end-users is crucial to ensure that the project outcomes are relevant, widely accepted and feasible in real-world settings.
The tools developed by the projects are expected to be widely accessible and amenable to necessary updates after the project?s end for further use by interested parties. Datasets generated during the project should be accessible to researchers and innovators. For example, genomic data and linked patient level data are expected to be made accessible for secondary use through the 1+MG data infrastructure.
This topic requires an effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The scientific and clinical communities, including health care providers and payers, as well as regulators, health systems and patients benefit from innovative diagnostic solutions that are better suited to tackle cross-border health threats.
?	The scientific and clinical communities have access to novel and improved methodologies for detection of pathogens with pandemic potential in humans and for timely discovery of other health threats, such as chemical, radiological and nuclear threats, including considerations on detection in animals and environmental conditions (One Health approach).
?	A diverse and robust pipeline of in vitro diagnostics224 is available, increasing options for clinical deployment in case of an epidemic or pandemic.
Scope: As shown by the COVID-19 pandemic, infectious diseases remain a major threat to health and health security in the EU and globally, this is also the case for other health threats that can be linked for instance to terror attacks. New cross-border health threats are expected to emerge in the coming years and therefore it is essential to promote advanced research of medical countermeasures that can be used to detect, prevent and treat in case of a new health

emergency. One of the most important aspects in crisis preparedness times is to ensure the availability of diagnostics that can contribute to detecting and characterising health threats.
Proposals should develop and advance on new in vitro diagnostics relevant for detecting and characterising cross-border health threats and develop novel approaches to the development of medical countermeasures targeting threats identified by HERA225 or by the WHO226.
Proposals should cover pathogens with pandemic potential in humans or other health threats, such as chemical, radiological and nuclear threats for which there are no existing diagnostics or where clinical practice could benefit from innovation. Emphasis should be put on the development of new diagnostics, innovative catch-all methodologies, or on the improvement of existing health technologies advancing diagnostics and characterisation of health threats, applying the One Health approach when relevant.
Proposals should aim to diversify and accelerate the global diagnostic research and development pipeline to tackle cross-border health threats, and to strengthen the current leading role of the EU in research and development, and therefore contributing to the work of the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).
Attention should be paid to critical social factors such as sex, gender, age, socio-economic factors, ethnicity/migration, and disability.
Proposals should include a clear regulatory path to market in order to ensure future compliance with the legal requirements. Proposals should address several of the following areas:
?	Proof-of-concept/early studies linked e.g. to performance evaluation of new diagnostics that facilitate screening, detection of the presence or exposure to a cross-border health threat or determination of infectious/disease status through human samples, included but not limited to the list of high impact health threats identified by HERA, as well chemical, radiological and nuclear threats for which there is a lack of in vitro diagnostics or existing diagnostics have a sub-optimal performance.
?	Data-driven diagnostic and prognostic platforms with AI and other advanced data analytics functionalities, adaptable to respond to new and multiple pathogens/threats, e.g. covering prototype viruses.
?	Innovative systems linked to high sensitivity/specificity profiles adaptable for broader use should be considered, such as portable, faster, more compact or accurate devices and technologies, including the possibility to develop point of care or self-tests.
?	Innovative diagnostics sampling methods or samples bringing a significant improvement, such as less invasive sampling methods.

HORIZON-HLTH-2023-TOOL-05-09, Developing a Data Quality and Utility Label for the,4/13/2023,CSA,1/12/2023,,,Around 4.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 5 ?Unlocking the full potential of new tools, technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Data Users (researchers, innovators, regulators, policy-makers, clinicians) are able to identify the most relevant datasets that meet their specific needs through a label describing accurately and in a standard way the quality and utility dimensions of the datasets, as proposed in the legal provisions of the European Health Data Space (EHDS).
?	Data holders have clear specifications for dataset quality and utility labelling to comply with the requirements proposed in the EHDS legal provisions. In addition to that, data holders have access to a maturity model with the requirements a dataset needs to fulfil to achieve higher levels of data quality and utility.
?	European and National public funders ensure that the datasets, for which they provided funding for the creation and curation of, are more widely available, furthering their reuse for secondary uses as proposed in the EHDS legal provisions (research, innovation, regulatory work, policy-making, personalised medicine).
?	The European Commission has access to a set of specifications for the data quality and utility label supporting the implementation of the EHDS legal provisions.
Scope: A vast quantity of health datasets exist across Europe, from multiple sources (individual care, medical registries, social, environmental behavioural, wellbeing, clinical trials, research, administrative, etc.), and of varying quality. This represents a tremendous opportunity for the reuse of this data for purposes other than for the one for which they were originally collected and spur the development of better prevention strategies, diagnoses, treatments and care plans.
The European Health Data Space (EHDS) will provide a common EU framework for secondary use of health data such as research, innovation, regulatory purposes, policy-making and personalised medicine. It will enable data users to have access to large amounts of health data through health data access bodies empowered with the EHDS legal provisions to overcome existing limitations regarding the processing of health data for secondary uses.
To support data users in the discovery and selection of datasets for their purposes, there is a growing need to develop a data quality and utility framework to articulate the characteristics and the potential usefulness of datasets. This framework will also support data holders in identifying and addressing areas of improvement which can, in turn, allow for wider and better use of these datasets.

Several initiatives have developed or are developing guidelines and recommendations for health data quality, however, these typically focus on specific data types (i.e. 1+ Million Genome Initiative227) or areas of applications (i.e. European Medicines Agency ? EMA and Heads of Medicines Agencies? Big Data Steering Group activities to support medicines regulation228). Similarly, previous studies and initiatives have addressed specific dimensions of ?data quality? for health data but none are offering a framework suitable for the breadth of data types and encompassing the quality and utility elements proposed in the EHDS legal provisions. The proposed framework should take into account the various needs of data users whilst at the same time avoid becoming an excessive burden on data holders which will need to produce the data quality and utility label.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Perform a mapping of existing data quality and utility principles/initiatives/frameworks (i.e. EMA/HMA Big Data Stakeholders Group Data quality efforts, TEHDAS Data Quality Working Group229, EOSC-LIFE230 Health Data Research UK?s data quality and utility framework231, and relevant data principles (FAIR232), resources and tools (FAIR Cookbook233, etc.);
?	Conduct various stakeholder consultations, integrating all relevant data users and data holders of health data, EHDS Health Data Access Bodies (HDABs) and other relevant actors to validate data user needs and adequately take into account relevant initiatives when developing the proposed framework;
?	Develop a framework (set of technical specifications) for the data quality and utility label that supports the implementation of the EHDS legal provisions and the roll out of the label by the data holders and EHDS Health Data Access Bodies;
?	Pilot and evaluate the use of the proposed framework (as a label and as a maturity model) on a datasets sample representing the wide-ranging data types (such as electronic health records, genomics datasets, medical registries, administrative data, etc.) and taking into account the needs of all data users identified.
?	Develop recommendations for the successful implementation and adoption of the data quality and utility label and maturity model across European Member States considering the maturity levels regarding secondary of health data.
The consortium should be composed of representatives from data users, data holders, health data access bodies, and other relevant stakeholders to the scope of secondary use of health

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed towards and contributing to several of the following expected Outcomes:
?	Biomedical scientists will access entire bio-printing units for regenerating human tissue.
?	Availability of larger-scale bio-printed tissues for biomedical research purposes to both industry and academia.

?	Healthcare professionals acquire information on the safe and effective use of advanced therapies.
?	Healthcare providers dispose of tools enabling them to treat conditions of unmet medical need.
?	Individual patients will benefit from a personalised approach to their respective medical condition thanks to the bio-printed regenerative medicine solution.
Scope: Regenerative medicine is a branch of translational research in tissue engineering and molecular biology which deals with the ""process of replacing, engineering or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore or establish normal function"". 3D-printing in general is considered an advanced manufacturing technique and 3D-printing of non-viable biomaterials to serve e.g. as scaffold for cell growth or as structure for medical devices is already broadly used.
However, bio-printing technology involving living cells is still in early stages of development, but has a huge potential for tissue engineering, drug testing and other biomedical applications. Tissue-specific functional 3D bio-printing is a new approach for transplantation applications in regenerative medicine, relying on the fabrication of tissues and organs with respect to the desired shape and function and their delivery and application in vivo. ?In-situ bio-printing? known as printing cells and biomaterials directly onto or in a patient, or 4D bio-printing, which introduces a ?time? variable that allows 3D printed materials to change shape or function when external stimulus is applied, are recent developments facing multiple additional challenges.
Despite some success of 3D bio-printing with thin tissue, thick tissue and complex organs remain a bottleneck because it is difficult to sufficiently mimic their metabolic needs, and the scientific knowledge about their intimate architecture and interplay with other tissues are not sufficiently elucidated. Next to these limitations are a lack of standardized manufacturing protocols and standardized bio-ink formulations with tuneable properties, unstable cellular behaviour, material biocompatibility and printability, etc. Taken together, 3D bio-printing is confronted with several challenges that currently hamper its large-scale deployment.
To overcome these challenges, researchers need to work in multidisciplinary teams with engineers, biomedical scientists, cell biologists and medical doctors and proposals should address most of the following activities:
?	Design the best bio-printing strategy for at least one type of tissue thanks to a better understanding of the interconnections of the different cell types inside the chosen tissue or organ
?	Develop or improve existing equipment able to print bio-constructs with higher resolution in a shorter time using various biomaterials and different cell types

?	Cover all steps of the bio-printing suite, including cell collection, cell differentiation and expansion, imaging, modelling, bio-ink formulation, actual bio-printing, nutrient supply, process monitoring and cell-construct delivery at target site
?	Scale-up the chosen bio-printing technology to a GMP-conform manufacturing process
?	Combine different bio-printing technologies in order to obtain fully functional synthetic constructs of complex tissues or organs.
Proof of regulatory knowledge of the field is required in the proposal by documented contacts with relevant national or international European regulatory authorities.
The chosen medical area (tissue, organ, condition) should be duly justified. Sex differences at the cellular level should be taken into consideration.
Preclinical stage and early clinical development are eligible. The involvement of SMEs is encouraged.

HORIZON-HLTH-2023-IND-06-01, Supporting the uptake of innovative Health Technology Assessment (HTA) methodology and advancing HTA expertise across EU,4/13/2023,CSA,1/12/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 ?Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Identification of the most innovative HTA methods developed by EU-funded projects, which respond to the needs of HTA bodies and are ready to be used in real-life settings. Endorsement by HTA bodies of such innovative methods would allow for advancing HTA methodology and improve evidence-based decision making, and patient access to novel health technologies
?	Dissemination among EU HTA bodies of robust innovative HTA methods and tools developed by EU-funded projects.
?	Harmonisation of HTA expertise across EU though the development of a training programme developed in collaboration with academia. The training should address HTA expertise in general, as wells as expertise in joint HTA to be carried out at EU level in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2021/2282, based on the methodological guidelines elaborated by the Coordination Group on HTA.
?	Contribution to a successful implementation of the HTA Regulation as well as to building an EU methodological HTA framework fit for purpose and fit for the future.
Scope: HTA bodies have the responsibility to assess the added-value of new health technologies and advise on its reimbursement and use within a healthcare system. Due to the rapid pace at which technology advance and in order to support decision making in an appropriate manner, HTA experts have to adapt/revise regularly their methodology. Whilst EU-funded projects in the field of HTA have addressed some of the research needs of the HTA bodies (e.g. methods of analysis, use of real world data, use of patient reported outcomes), translation of their results/recommendations into HTA work remains limited.
Advancing HTA methodology and expertise could benefit from a more systematic dialogue between HTA bodies and academia. Therefore, this action could represent an excellent opportunity for both those generating and those using the evidence to come together and discuss the key HTA methodological issues.
Under the newly adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/2282, the Coordination Group on HTA will have to adopt methodological guidelines for joint HTA work (e.g. joint clinical assessments, joint scientific consultation), to regularly review, and where necessary update them. The

project could provide input to issues identified by the Coordination Group as important for future updates/revisions of HTA methodology for joint HTA work.
The topic is divided into two strands of activities, with applicants tackling both in their proposals:
?	Implementation of innovative HTA methods: EU-funded research projects (e.g. COMED, IMPACT-HTA, HTx, GetReal, EHDEN) developed innovative methods aiming at addressing HTA bodies? needs. Identifying which of these methods are ready to be used in real-life settings is a first crucial step towards broader uptake and dissemination. Successful implementation of innovative methods in actual HTA practices will contribute to provide a timely response to HTA challenges (e.g. use of real-world data in HTA) also providing a sound scientific resource for updates of methodological guidelines by the Coordination Group on HTA for joint activities as requested by the Regulation (EU) 2021/2282. HTA bodies/agencies participating in such activities will gain expertise in those methods that could be later transferred to other bodies/agencies using the training framework developed in the second strand of work.
?	Advancing HTA expertise across Europe should be carried out through a training programme tailored to the needs of HTA bodies, which may include twinning activities between HTA bodies/agencies to develop expertise and facilitate knowledge sharing among HTA bodies/agencies in the EU. The training programme is expected to contribute to the harmonisation of HTA practices in the EU that will in turn contribute to a greater consistency of health technology assessments across Europe. Thus, the training programme should also support the engagement of HTA experts from Member States and EEA countries in carrying out joint HTA work starting January 2025 (i.e. implementation date of the Regulation on HTA), with the aim to produce high-quality and robust joint clinical assessments. The training programme should include all the necessary elements for carrying out robust assessments at national and EU level. Regarding the latter, the training programme should also promote the dissemination of the methodological guidelines to be adopted by the Coordination Group on HTA (based on the methodology developed and fine-tuned by EUnetHTA joint actions and EUnetHTA21 service contract).
The proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Identification of innovative methods and tools, in particular those developed in EU- funded projects able to address HTA bodies' needs (in different areas: relative effectiveness assessment, cost-effectiveness assessment, etc.)
?	Identifications of barriers to the uptake of these methods (and potential associated tools,
e.g. open source software to run cost-effectiveness analyses)

?	Use cases (based on the needs identified by HTA bodies) to facilitate the endorsement by HTA bodies of innovative methods

?	Development of an implementation plan including supporting tools and training modules (by researchers, alone or in collaboration with HTA bodies, to be delivered to HTA bodies/agencies)
?	Recommendations for broader dissemination",

More specifically, this topic aims at supporting activities that are contributing to the following impact area: ?High quality digital services for all.? To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes, and provide appropriate qualitative and quantitative indicators to measure their progress and specific impact:
?	European Health Record (EHR) stakeholders (e.g. developers, suppliers, integrators, and operators) have at their disposal and use fit-for-purpose standards, guidelines, and toolsets for prioritised health information domains to address interoperability of EHRs in

line with the principles set in the EEHRxF Recommendation246, contributing also to security and privacy.
?	Stakeholders dispose better quality and better integrated health datasets within the European Health Data Space,247 to foster innovations in the health sector and leverage the potential of new analytics solutions such as AI and big data, and to get new insights and detect trends from aggregated data, including for cross-border health threats.
?	Citizens are provided with an expanded access to their health data, also across borders, and innovative digital services for high-quality health and care across the EU.
Scope: EHR interoperability has yet to become a reality in a number of use cases and health information domains. It is a complex, multi-dimensional challenge. EHRs across the Member States are diverse; so are languages, cultures, and practices in the health sector. Different technical specifications, technologies and clinical terminologies are used, involving a range of stakeholders, within and across care settings.
Proposals should address all of the following:

?	Research, develop and validate harmonised interoperability formats for sharing data in some priority health information domains that should be selected with reference to the EU policies and priorities. The output formats should enable EHR interoperability across the Member States and address cross-border health data exchange by-design and in line with the principles set in the EEHRxF Recommendation.
?	Leverage and scale up the potential of EHR through enhanced interoperability to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of patient care, enforce patients right to data portability, enhance care coordination, guide crisis planning, reduce medical errors, and lower costs.

?	Clinical researchers, developers and regulators use accurate computational models to improve the statistical robustness in clinical trials intended for small populations and guide cost-effective clinical trial designs.
?	Clinical researchers and regulators have access to accurate in-silico tools for assessing the actionable use of real world data and for successfully estimating the risk-benefit effects in clinical trials for small populations.
?	Regulators develop guidance for the use of validated computational models to support a robust extrapolation framework and facilitate the safety and efficacy assessment in the process of regulatory appraisal of orphan and/or paediatric medicinal products.
Scope: In its ""Regulatory Science Strategy to 2025"", the European Medicines Agency included specific recommendations to optimise the capabilities of modelling and simulation in the medicines development process and in particular to benefit special populations and neglected patient populations.
Orphan drug development faces numerous challenges, including low disease prevalence, patient population heterogeneity and strong presence of paediatric patient populations. Consequently, clinical trials for orphan and/or paediatric medicines are often smaller than traditional large-scale randomised ones and they require the development of efficient trial designs relevant to small.
Model-based approaches are significantly advantageous in small populations, as extrapolation tools for rationalising and increasing the statistical robustness in clinical trial designs and pharmacometric studies.
The topic will support research and innovation activities focusing on the development of diverse modelling and simulation methods, as tools for addressing some of the regulatory needs in the clinical development cycle of new orphan and paediatric medicinal products. The topic is not intended to support new preclinical/clinical studies but to use the existing knowledge/data for assessing and optimising the performance of mature in-silico models in the regulatory context with the goal of improving the clinical trial designs for small populations. Availability of the relevant data to address the requirements of the topic is an indispensable condition that must be demonstrated at the proposal submission.
Proposals should involve national healthcare product regulatory bodies and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in order to catalyse an effective collaboration between the researchers and the regulators. The active involvement of patient representatives is required in all phases of the research and innovation activities. Furthermore, SME(s) participation is encouraged with the aim to strengthen their scientific and technological basis.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Establish a multidisciplinary approach for assessing the utility of mature computational models, as tools for supporting the optimal design of innovative clinical trials for small populations and as fit-for-purpose solutions for enabling the regulatory scientific advice

and marketing authorisation assessment of orphan and/or paediatric medicines, including their pharmacovigilance follow-up.
?	Calibrate and optimise mature computational models for enhancing their clinical performance, by using relevant sources of patient data (e.g. natural history and observational clinical studies, medical records, registries, pharmacovigilance and longitudinal studies etc.). The models should include a variety of modelling methods and in particular hybrid solutions linking quantitative mechanistic modelling with advanced statistical modelling (e.g. quantitative systems pharmacology, disease mechanistic models, physiology-based pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic models, Bayesian modelling, artificial intelligence algorithms etc.).
?	Assess validated in-silico models for their capability to increase the statistical robustness, improve the risk/benefit assessment in small population clinical trials, and for their accuracy to predict and extrapolate the therapeutic and dose effects, taking into account the patient?s genotypes/phenotypes, disease characteristics/stage variables and/or clinical/surrogate endpoints for delivering robust evidence of safety and efficacy of the orphan and paediatric medicines under study. The assessment of the in-silico models should be demonstrated in use cases representing well-justified group(s) of rare and/or paediatric diseases with commonalities, such as shared molecular denominators/disease pathways within the same and/or across different medical areas, excluding cancer and infectious diseases.
?	Benchmark of diverse computational models by showcasing their simulation performance in virtual patient cohorts and by demonstrating that the models? synthetic data estimates match to actual clinical trial data. This should lead to an assessment of the performance and credibility of a model simulation in the context of their specific use for regulatory purposes. Benchmark studies should be performed in the use cases mentioned above. Availability of clinical trials data and other relevant data is an indispensable requirement that must be demonstrated at the proposal submission.
?	Set-up the criteria for the performance and credibility assessment of any relevant computational models for small population clinical trials to progress on their regulatory qualification and acceptability. Further develop and disseminate standards for the design, performance assessment and reporting of modelling and simulation tools with an emphasis on those of high regulatory value for accelerating the clinical development of orphan and paediatric medicinal products.
The proposals should adhere to the FAIR data principles, adopt data quality standards, data integration operating procedures and GDPR-compliant data sharing/access good practices developed by the European research infrastructures, where relevant. Proposals are invited to consider adopting recommendations for in-silico models construction and validation249. Data-

intensive proposals, particularly those using data from patient registries, should take stock of the tools and services provided by the European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform). For example, retrospective registry data are expected to be made accessible via EU RD platform, if reasonably feasible.
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. This could also involve networking and joint activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. In this regard, the Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with relevant stakeholders.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Challenging aspects of regulation, policy, safety, efficacy, manufacturing, organisation, infrastructure, decision-making, and commercialisation are identified for speeding up the equitable clinical applications of ATMPs.
?	European regulatory frameworks are adapted to novel scientific progress, especially those related to platform approaches, genome editing, interface with medical devices, artificial intelligence.
?	Competent authorities in the Member States can propose adapted pricing and reimbursement schemes that allow European citizens to benefit from novel ATMPs.
?	Academic and SME developers and manufacturers of ATMPs have an increased knowledge of the regulatory aspects.
?	The decentralised manufacturing of ATMPs is consistent across health care centres.
Scope: New pioneering treatments called Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), including cell and gene therapies, have the potential to bring new cures to patients affected by diseases with limited or no available treatments. However, several hurdles impede or slow down the access of ATMPs to patients in Europe. These include e.g. regulatory challenges, underlying scientific uncertainties, differences in assessing the values of ATMPs by the various Health Technology Agencies (HTA), difficulties to perform randomized-controlled clinical trials or to obtain long-term safety and effectiveness data, the lack of harmonised approaches to the reimbursement of the high upfront costs by health systems, manufacturing processes, etc.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Map the regulatory, safety and efficacy assessment, manufacturing, organisational and infrastructural needs to improve the translation of ATMPs from preclinical development to clinical use.

?	Address the gaps and uncertainties in regulatory and policy aspects pertinent to complex innovative ATMPs.
?	Address predictivity of preclinical data for safety and efficacy testing of ATMPs.
Improved novel models could be proposed.

?	Tackle decision-making processes relating to ATMPs, such as for instance the assessment of their values, the demonstration of the long-term safety and effectiveness, or new pricing and reimbursement frameworks.
?	Propose opportunities for an improved knowledge of the regulatory processes among academic ATMP developers.
?	Involve regulatory authorities, Health Technology Agencies (HTA), clinicians, ethics committees, and patients, with the aim to ensure higher clinical use of ATMPs. The findings of the project will be available to competent authorities, ATMP developers and manufacturers as well as to national/regional funding agencies",

More specifically, this topic aims at supporting activities that are contributing to the following impact area: ?High quality digital services for all?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Policy-makers in the EU have at their disposal a methodological framework and standardised approaches for assessing digital health technologies, that helps them make evidence-based decisions regarding the introduction of digital health technologies in their health and care systems with added value for patients and society.
?	Regulators have access to robust, scientifically underpinned evaluation methodologies.
?	EU citizens gain faster access to safe and well-performing person-centred digital technologies and are empowered through these tools.
?	Health technology developers are better informed and dispose of more guidance on the evidence needed to demonstrate the added value of digital health technologies and have better insights on market predictability.
?	(Digital) Health Industry/digital health technology developers and HTA bodies can contribute to the development of EU harmonised Health Technology Assessment (HTA) rules based on common principles.
?	Improved cross-border use and interoperability of digital health tools and services throughout Europe.
?	Increased trust in digital health technologies and better integration of digital health tools and services in health and care systems.
Scope: Digital health technologies have been driving a revolution in health and care ranging from general use of computers to algorithms designed to assist radiologists and radiotherapists in detecting and treating diseases, from robotic surgery to artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer aided decision models, and from mobile apps helping patients to self- manage their disease to electronic health records.
Digital health technologies are expected to further contribute to better people-centred health and care systems and have the vast potential to improve our ability to accurately prevent, diagnose and treat diseases.
However, assessing the added value and health benefits for patients and society pose a number of challenges in particular of methodological and technical nature. Best practice for common approaches in methodology for digital health are lacking, especially in the digital health tools that include artificial intelligence algorithms. A framework for the assessment of the digital transformation of health services and its impact is vital to generate the evidence

required for decision-making on stimulating, using and/or funding digital health strategies at various levels in the health and care systems.
The Expert Panel on effective ways of investing in Health (EXPH) recommended in its report ?Assessing the impact of digital transformation of health services250?, further investment in the development of assessment methodologies and in a European repository for evaluation methods and evidence of digital health services.
To date, such assessment frameworks are relatively scarce, especially those addressing the transformative aspects of healthcare delivery on the organisational and operational level.
The proposals are expected to develop and harmonise methodologies for assessing digital health technologies (including mhealth apps and telehealth, as well as Artificial Intelligence powered health technologies) in order to facilitate assessment of their added value at individual, health system and society levels and facilitate the cross-border deployment of digital health services within the EU. Existing Health Technology Assessment (HTA) methodology is well developed for health technologies such as medicinal products, but also for some categories of medical devices; however digitalisation raises new methodological challenges to the standardisation of assessment criteria such as privacy, cybersecurity, data storage and handling, interoperability, usability etc. Also including aspects like learning curves, iterative development of innovations, variability between settings, determining optimal timing of evaluations in the development process (maturity) are not yet solved.
Proposals are expected to build on existing frameworks such as (but not restricted to) ?Model for Assessment of Telemedicine? (MAST framework ? Kidholm et al., 2012) and the results of previous EU-funded projects in particular (but not restricted to) COMED, project that already identified HTA challenges of telehealth and mhealth, and mHealth hub251.
Proposals should consider involving the JRC to take advantage of its expertise on assessment frameworks of innovative health technologies and its activities at the interface between research and regulatory aspects and/or in translating assessment results into best practice recommendations anchored in EU policies. In that respect, the JRC is open to collaborate with any successful proposal after its approval.
The proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Develop and/or expand a general methodological framework and standardised approaches to assess digital health technologies with a particular focus on criteria such as privacy, cybersecurity, data quality, data storage and handling, interoperability etc.;
?	Comply with the relevant requirements proposed in the European Health Data Space (EHDS) legal provisions;

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Patients gain faster access to innovative, safe and well-performing medical devices;
?	Regulators have access to sound scientific resources for clinical/performance evaluation guidance and development of common specifications as foreseen in Article 9 of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR);
?	Notified bodies, by their direct participation to the production of documents, will have a harmonised way of assessing the clinical evidence in the pre-market and post-market phases; furthermore their network254, will be enhanced;
?	Health technology developers gain insight on the evidence needed to demonstrate that their devices meet MDR clinical requirements throughout their lifetime. They will also have more guidance on the use of real-world data for their clinical development strategies.
Scope: The Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and in vitro diagnostic medical device Regulation (IVDR) provides a new regulatory framework where reinforcement of clinical/performance evaluation of medical devices and IVDs, and in particular high-risk medical devices, is a key element. The confirmation of conformity with the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in the MDR and IVDR255 is based on clinical data and its assessment (clinical/performance evaluation), including the evaluation of the acceptability of the benefit-risk- ratio. Within this new framework, the clinical/performance evaluation should follow a defined and methodologically sound procedure based on the critical evaluation of the relevant scientific literature, a critical evaluation of the results of all available clinical investigations/performance studies, as well as consideration of currently available alternative treatment options for the device under evaluation. Clinical/performance evaluation has to be updated throughout the life cycle of the device. Hence,

254	Article 49 ? Coordination Group of notified bodies
255	Annex I General safety and performance

clinical/performance evaluation can draw on multiple types of data including data from initial clinical investigations/performance studies and data gathered by the manufacturer's post- market surveillance system. To operationalise this new requirement, research is needed to help regulators develop common methodological frameworks (including common specifications256) on the clinical evidence needed to demonstrate safety, performance and clinical benefit all along the life cycle of devices taking into account the type of device and clinical intended purpose.
Such methodological frameworks and standardised approaches are particularly needed for high-risk medical devices, e.g. implantable and class III medical devices, class C and D IVDs, medical device software (including AI enabled devices and next generation sequencing) and other highly innovative devices.
In order to address the differences between evidence generation for medical devices and IVDs, the project should be tackled taking into account those differences.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Development of a framework for a life-cycle approach to evidence generation and evaluation of high-risk and innovative medical devices and IVDs. This framework will provide a description of the types of evidence i) that meet safety and performance for market access, and ii) that have to be generated to fulfil post-market responsibilities. When appropriate it would be beneficial to consider to what extent the framework could be relevant to demonstrate relative effectiveness as needed for Health Technology Assessment. As regards highly innovative devices, particular attention may be paid to defining acceptable levels of uncertainty in terms of benefit-risk ratio at market entry as well as the type of post-market follow-up to be implemented to generate additional clinical evidence able to reduce this uncertainty. This could be particularly relevant for devices e.g. having no or little similarities with existing devices in terms of intended purpose, mode of action, materials or, for IVDs, with no existing reference materials.;
?	For medical devices, a pilot to support development of common specifications which would set the stage for a common specification ecosystem for medical devices in Europe257, including the development of standardised/common endpoints and associated health outcomes measures by technology type and where relevant by clinical intended purpose;
?	Development of a general methodological approach to define, determine and update the state of the art for different device technologies. The robustness of the developed approach should be evaluated on 3 different medical devices types and 3 different IVD types;


256	Mandatory applicable ?technical standards? providing to the manufacturers means of proving conformity with the safety and performance legal requirements, issued by Commission as Implementing Acts.

?	Possible use of registries and other sources of real-world data for demonstration of regulatory compliance both pre- and post-market: minimum requirements for data quality, completeness and data reliability, statistical methods for data analysis, methods for limiting biases, methods for data linkage, determination of what acceptable evidence can be drawn from registries;
?	Methodology for bridging studies for devices and IVDs with iterative development: assessment of data coming from previous versions of the device and where relevant integration of that data into the device?s clinical investigation/performance study and gap assessment between the different versions of the device;
?	Identification of relevant quantitative and qualitative methodologies for integrating evidence derived from various data sources in the clinical evaluation/performance evaluation;
Proposals should build on relevant completed and ongoing initiatives in the field, in particular (but not restricted to) EU-funded initiatives.258 Proposals should involve researchers who are specialised in the clinical/performance evaluation of medical devices/IVDs and in the use of real-world data to evaluate medical products. Proposals should involve national competent authorities, notified bodies, IVD laboratories as well as Health Technology Assessment bodies and could involve patients? representatives where relevant.

HORIZON-HLTH-2024-IND-06-09, Gaining experience and confidence in New Approach Methodologies (NAM) for regulatory safety and efficacy testing ? coordinated training and experience exchange for EU regulators,4/11/2024,CSA,10/26/2023,,,Around 2.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing to one or several expected impacts of destination 6 ?Maintaining an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health industry?. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	European regulators gain state-of-the-art knowledge on different NAMs that are being proposed for the assessment of the safety and efficacy of chemicals and pharmaceuticals;
?	European regulators understand better the shortcomings of the current tools based on animal procedures for the assessment of chemicals and pharmaceuticals;
?	European regulators collaborate on a framework on how to assess the safety of chemicals and pharmaceuticals based on NAM-data and how to classify the hazardous properties based on such data;
?	Citizens benefit from the supply and use of chemicals and pharmaceuticals that have been assessed through NAMs that are better predicting potential effects in humans than the current assessment methods;
?	Industry has an improved competitive position with the availability of harmonized and standardized NAM-based assessment tools that are faster and more flexible;
?	European Commission and Member States regulators are responding to the societal demand to move away from animal testing.
Scope: There is increasing scientific evidence pointing to the limitations of animal testing for safety and efficacy assessment of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Europe is also experiencing

a strong societal demand to move away from animal testing. Scientific progress of the past two decades has produced a number of animal-free New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that have the potential to be used instead of the animal models that are currently employed for such testing. However, knowledge, experience and confidence on how results from the NAM assays could be used is still lacking among regulators, which could limit the industry?s use of NAMs because of lack of legal certainty when generating safety and health data requested by EU legislation.
The proposals should focus on alternatives to the use of animals for regulatory safety and efficacy testing. Applicants should propose activities that bring together NAM developers and NAM users with European regulators responsible for the safe use of chemicals (e.g. industrial chemicals, pesticides, biocides and cosmetics) and pharmaceuticals in order to inform on NAM solutions available and to encourage the building of a framework on how these NAMs could be most effectively used in the different decision-making contexts.
To build such a framework the proposals should address all of the following:

?	develop technical and regulatory readiness criteria
?	reflect on how to provide mechanisms to support technology transfer, i.e. bringing promising NAMs to the market (including optimisation and transferability assessment)
?	discuss how to standardise NAMs and NAM-based strategies via OECD, CEN, ISO and other international organisations
?	provision of technical training for Contract Research Organisations (CROs) applying NAMs for the (REACH) registrants
?	promoting dialogue (involving companies, regulatory bodies on EU level and Member States authorities) on how to integrate and interpret data from NAMs and facilitate their uptake for safety and efficacy testing of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, while addressing the lack of reliability and shortcomings of the current tools based on animal procedures
?	Identify obstacles in EU legislation for the regulatory use of NAMs and propose options/changes in the EU regulatory framework which address these obstacles and facilitate the uptake and use of NAM
Proposals should consider involving the JRC to take advantage of its expertise and relevant activities in bridging research and regulatory communities and facilitating uptake of NAMs for regulatory application. In that respect, the JRC is open to collaborate with any successful proposal after its approval",

?	Protect democratic processes in the EU from Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI)8by foreign actors while preserving the fundamental rights and freedoms underlying these processes.
?	Increase our ability to pro-actively detect, analyse and counter foreign attempts to harm the integrity of our democratic processes by creating a better understanding of the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved in these attempts, with the aim to improve our ability to technically attribute them to specific foreign actors.
?	Increase our understanding of the behavioural and societal effect ? both short- and long- term ? of those attempts.
?	Develop and extend the solution-space for policymakers, private stakeholders, and civil society actors to counter FIMI and raise resilience to it. Also, improve our understanding of the efficiency and potential negative side-effects of such solutions and propose mitigating measures.
?	Improve our normative and theoretical understanding of the tensions between the value/norm of a free, pluralistic, and democratic society, FIMI, and domestic anti- democratic forces.
Scope: Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference is a key global challenge and needs to be addressed in full respect of fundamental rights like the freedom of speech, freedom of expression and media freedom.9 A pre-condition for counter-acting efforts to undermine such democratic values is an understanding of the TTPs used to manipulate information environments in an intentional, harmful and coordinated manner. Understanding these TTPs and having the means to share them with stakeholder and partners, allow democratic governments to impose costs and efficiently disrupt the ?supply chain? for manipulated information.
This research will therefore look at (1) how to create a common understanding of parameters needed to provide technical attribution, (2) how these TTPs can be identified and gathered and
(3)	how they can be stored and shared in an adequate privacy-compliant environment. While there are existing proposals (like the DISARM framework10), more research is needed on the practicability and potential pitfalls of these frameworks. There are also ongoing efforts to create

Such activity is manipulative in character, conducted in an intentional and coordinated manner, often in relation to other hybrid activities. Actors of such activity can be state or non-state actors, including their proxies inside and outside of their own territory. FIMI is to be understood within the wider context of hybrid threats, of which it is one concrete modality. A conceptual model of hybrid threats can be found in ?The landscape of hybrid threats? (https://op.europa.eu/s/vUUk)

an interoperable Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)11 which would provide a means for the various stakeholders to systematically and efficiently exchange information of TTPs used by threat actors, to which this research could contribute.
As most of the activities qualified as FIMI are still not defined as ?illegal? under national and international law, another important research angle is to what extent FIMI is used in conjunction with illegal activity such as cyber-attacks or hate speech. More specifically, the research should look at the following specific contexts in which TTPs may appear: how foreign actors use proxies within their own territory and abroad to support their activities; how TTPs related to FIMI are used in combination with TTPs outside the FIMI remit, such as cyber criminality; how FIMI campaigns may target individual policymakers and/or social groups in attempts to influence decision making processes in politics, economy or societal affairs, taking into account relevant characteristics of the targeted groups (e.g. gender, social origin, ethnicity). Likewise, the connections between foreign actors and their ecosystem with domestic democratic and anti- democratic forces should be explored ? how do they influence each other, how do they align their TTPs and/or how could connections be addressed politically, without interfering in the democratic process. Other forms of foreign interference like elite capture, the use of foreign direct investment, or threats of armed attacks as means of influence, are also in the scope of the research this topic aims to cover. Contributions from behavioural, cognitive, political, legal and communication disciplines, among others, should ensure the required multidisciplinary coverage of such a research plan.
Based on these insights and research, response options should be proposed to give policymakers, but also stakeholders from civil society and private industry, solutions and options to implement as appropriate. These should take into account existing responses and tools, thereby extending and improving the solution space. All the possible response options need to be in full respect of fundamental rights and freedoms and potential risks of any such options should be outlined, e.g. how illiberal democracies, authoritarian regimes and domestic anti-democratic forces could exploit them for their own purposes. Given the very intense ongoing multilateral efforts to tackle this threat, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.
Proposals are encouraged to develop links and eventually use outcomes in particular from the projects financed under HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised. They should also foresee appropriate collaboration with the ongoing Horizon 2020 action EU-HYBNET 12 .

?	Better understanding on how to protect fundamental rights and freedoms from possible threats stemming from the use of information suppression as part of Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI13) by authoritarian regimes.
?	In-depth conceptual and practical understanding of how authoritarian states worldwide have used and use information suppression ? and the specific Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) involved ? in their foreign policy, foreign information manipulation operations.

?	Develop policy recommendations, toolkits and methodologies to detect and address information suppression in the EU, associated and third countries.
Scope: FIMI goes beyond the much-used concept of ?disinformation?, which focusses on the active promotion of messages and pushing out of false/misleading content. FIMI also includes other aspects of how the information environment and civic discourse can be manipulated, notably through the suppression of independent and critical voices. Information suppression can take many forms but has the opposite goal to active promotion of messages. It aims to eliminate ? or suppress ? from the public sphere certain voices or messages. Information suppression by authoritarian actors can be domestic but also reach outside of their borders. Domestic information suppression has been observed surrounding the Russian invasion of

Different facets of information suppression should be examined by means of multidisciplinary approaches bringing together historical, social, legal, political, behavioural and communication disciplines among others. Which countries outside the EU have used information suppression in a systematic manner as part of their policies and how could a conceptual definition of information suppression look like to incorporate all parts of such activity? This should include a collection of cases and examples of information suppression by different actors to establish such a conceptual definition and create an evidence base. The research should also look at both the domestic and cross-border dimensions of suppression and catalogue the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) that have been used to suppress information by different actors. This should focus on different aspects, ranging from the individual (harassment, intimidation, etc.) to the society (restriction of fundamental rights and freedoms, including repression of women and minority rights) to the media (restriction of media freedom, pressuring foreign media outlets or journalists), academia (instigating self-censorship, using visa or archive access to pressure foreign researchers) as well as pressure on private industry (forcing social media companies to comply with national, authoritarian rules; using economic coercion to force international companies to be silent on certain issues, etc). A compendium of such TTPs should be created, with examples of such TTPs to document their use.
Information suppression can target any critical and independent voice; however, targeting the diaspora outside of the country?s territory has been observed as one vector. The research should generate an understanding of how diaspora communities are being targeted by information suppression and how FIMI actors try to co-opt them as agents of information suppression.
This research will generate a better understanding of the functioning of information suppression as well as its behavioural and societal effects (e.g. self-censorship etc.). This research should contribute to an analytical methodology of how to identify and analyse information suppression in its different forms; it should give policy recommendations on how to reduce the vulnerability to information suppression, how to protect the targets of information suppression and how to respond to it. The policy recommendations, toolkits and methodologies on how to identify information suppression and protect against it should be made accessible to civil society and stakeholders.

?	Increased knowledge and data on political corruption and other undue influences14 on policymaking and policy implementation, and on how these impact the understanding of democracy and rule of law and the adherence of citizens to those values.
?	Advance knowledge on the use of technologies (including AI, blockchain, encrypted data analysis...) to prevent and detect corruption and other undue political influence in the EU and its neighbourhood.
?	Reinforce national and EU legislative tools for preventing and fighting corruption, so as to bridge the gap between a fertile corruption measurement landscape and the different levels of commitment shown by governments to the prevention of and fight against corruption.
Scope: Beyond its financial and economic costs, corruption and undue influence ? whether real or perceived ? erodes the social contract underpinning democracies, and hence the system?s credibility and legitimacy. By undermining democracy and exacerbating inequalities, corruption and policy/state/ elite capture in general decrease the legitimacy of the democratic system and pave the way for citizen?s distrust and populist narratives. Despite abundant strategies, toolkits, approaches and indicators produced over the last two decades to win the fight against corruption, it can be argued that the practical results of anticorruption efforts have been disappointing. The problem appears resistant to solution and new / digitally enabled forms of undue influence seem to emerge.
Corruption and anticorruption are about human behaviour and require therefore multifaceted and multidisciplinary research. Proposals should aim at bringing together the contributions from behavioural and political economists, psychologists and anthropologists, historians, lawyers, political scientists, communication scholars, etc. Their research findings should

14	According to the OECD, undue influence is the act of attempting to influence the design, implementation, execution and evaluation of public policies and regulations administered by public officials, whether by providing covert, deceptive or misleading evidence or data, by manipulating public opinion or by using other practices intended to manipulate the decisions of public officials.

contribute to a deeper understanding of corruption and further the evaluation of the quality of democracy and good governance. Proposals under this topic should aim at reproducing the level of ambition, both in terms of consortium composition and the breath, range and duration of their research plan, of the FP7 collaborative project ANTICORRP.15
On the conceptual level, research under this topic should build a solid and encompassing understanding of (i) the cross-border character of new expressions of political corruption involving a constellation of actors cutting across the political, administrative, financial and commercial spheres; (ii) integrity and its relationship to corruption and the requirements of effective models of integrity management, both in the public and private sectors; (iii) the role played by the data analytics sector in political communication to malignly influence and disrupt politics in foreign jurisdictions; (vi) and the role played by investigative journalism in strengthening accountability by revealing transnational corruption and illicit financial flows. Studying, especially through comparative and historical research, rhetorical, linguistic and cultural aspects of corruption will help to develop a stronger theoretical ground for the critical analysis of social representations of corruption. The role of education and media, in particular social media, and their impact on how corruption is socially constructed, perceived and dealt with in the public sphere, deserves special attention.
On the practical side, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries from the EU Neighbourhood and accessing countries. Proposals should look at tools to strengthen public-private partnerships for fighting corruption, including inter-institutional and inter- sectorial collaborations among different stakeholders (such as small/large enterprises mentorship), or transparent guidelines for the inclusion of interest groups in political processes. Understanding the potential use of technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, encrypted data analysis, blockchain, building information modelling?) to detect, prevent and combat corruption and other undue influences should receive particular attention, without overlooking their potential misuse. The analysis of open government experiences and dissemination of practices of civic tracking systems, as opportunities of transparency and prevention of corruption, may also contribute to the assessment of the hopes and challenges of digital anti- corruption efforts. While abundant corruption indexes help to understand different angles of this problem, most of them are perception based and/or focus on particular issues. Overall overviews of corruption within the EU are difficult and proposals should aim to overcome this shortfall.
Proposals are encouraged to seek synergies and collaboration whenever possible with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL3-2022-FCT-01-05: Effective fight against corruption.

HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-04, The emotional politics of democracies,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Better informed political decision-making through a thorough understanding of the interactions between emotions, values, identities, collective and individual experiences, and beliefs in informing political decision-making, and how they impact democratic governance.
?	Better integration of the emotional dimension of politics in policies to foster and promote European democracies and values.
?	Boosted trust in governance through improved attention towards the emotional needs of citizens, and establishment of emotional ties when developing and communicating policies.
?	Improved communication of evidence-based policies that resonate with the emotional needs and conditions of citizens.
?	Enhance scientific evidence, from multidisciplinary disciplines, around emergent social interaction and communication concepts for the upcoming era of digital universes and intertwined real and virtual life. Build scenarios on how this may impact democracies and propose policy recommendations accordingly.
Scope: With a rise in polarisation and affective citizenship in European democracies, the role of emotions has become central in debates about democracy. This has become more evident when considering the role of social media and certain political narratives in targeting and capitalising on such emotions.
In this context, proposals under this call should examine the role of affect and emotions (such as hope, resentment, happiness, fear, dissatisfaction, frustration, solidarity, hatred, envy, shame,

pride, humiliation, etc.) in European democracies, how they interact with values, identities16, experiences and beliefs, and how this impacts democracies and democratic governance.
Using longitudinal analyses and cross-country comparisons, proposals would contribute to understanding how changing emotional landscapes, feeling rules, display norms and shifts in popular feelings interact with practices and values core to democratic politics. Examples of this might include, but are not limited to, participation and political mobilisation; voting trends; trust, disinformation and post-truths; identitarian movements; activism and social movements; collective action and collective responsibility; extremism, etc. Proposals are encouraged to consider political narratives, campaigns and styles of leadership that build on such emotional politics, and the role of traditional and social media in fostering such public emotions.
Proposals are invited to use current events as case studies. Climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, as well as the brutal aggression of Ukraine by Russia, elicit a variety of collective emotions (anxiety, pessimism, nostalgia, etc.), which have broader societal and political implications. Emotion-based responses to these crises (e.g. blaming others, outgroup hostility, hope for the better future, collective solidarity, etc.) correlated with socio- demographic and political factors (including dis/trust in political institutions and leaders, perception of in/efficacy, dis/interest in politics etc.) might have an impact on political participation patterns. What might it be? And in what ways can emotional resilience be increased in a post-pandemic Europe? Proposals are also encouraged to evaluate the role and use of emotions in political communication.
In addition, proposals should ideate and pilot innovative ways to build on the emotional dimension of democracies to foster and promote democratic practices and European values. They should also provide concrete guidelines on how to better listen to the emotional needs of citizens and take them into account when developing policies, with a view to boost trust in governance. This includes exploring better ways to communicate evidenced-based policies that resonate with the emotional needs of citizens and create emotional ties. Proposals can also put forward training or awareness raising activities to ensure informed decision-making.
Finally, proposals should provide a robust evidence base and forward-looking scenarios around emergent social interaction and communication concepts for the upcoming era of digital universes and intertwined real and virtual life. At a time when social media monetise emotions, and with the growing popularity of metaverses and multiverses, how emotions displayed in and arising from digitally-mediated communication may impact democracies should be investigated.
Researchers are encouraged to use a combination of methods from different fields, to build novel and mixed-methods research designs, concepts and theories that allow understanding the interplay between emotion and democratic politics.

HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-05, The climate imperative and its impact on democratic governance,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Enhance the ability of democratic governance to address complex and long-term challenges, through better understanding of the socio-political dimension of the climate crisis (including climate movements) and its impact on democratic governance, participation and social cohesion; the impact of the green transition on public governance and democratic practices, their legitimacy and responsiveness; and the increasing role of non-majoritarian institutions in decision-making.
?	Enhance the capacity of democratic governance to mobilise and engage citizens through participation, and better informed decision-making and communication to citizens on climate related policies, based on learnings from the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, disaster and end-time scenarios analysis, and other historic examples for such political and societal imperatives.
?	Improve policymaking approaches at all levels of government through recommendations to address the climate imperative in a democratic manner supported by citizens, balancing it with other policy imperatives, including the role of education in fostering climate literacy.





17		For instance under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05: Evolution of political extremism and its influence on contemporary social and political dialogue, and the JRC initiative for Meaningful and Ethical Communication (Enlightenment 2.0).

?	Encourage international cooperation through better understanding of the supranational challenges of the climate crisis, and of the consequences of climate crisis scenarios on demand for democratic structures, international politics and citizen engagement.
Scope: Climate movements have highlighted the question of whether urgent climate goals can be met while respecting democratic processes, maintaining trust, legitimacy and efficiency of democratic institutions. A large segment of society, on the other hand, perceives the changes on their personal life-style needed to mitigate or adapt to climate change as too burdensome, or focuses on other priorities, e.g. policy imperatives linked to financial or security issues. Policies adopted under the climate transition will not be pain-free, increasing the difficulty for democratic governments seeking re-election to legislate effectively to meet the demands of the climate crisis. Social inequalities increase the risk that the less advantaged segments of society will be more negatively impacted by the climate crisis and policies made for the climate transition. The common global goals for the climate transition also highlight the deficiencies of governance on supranational issues.
At the same time, the climate imperative also opens up avenues for innovative civic participation in an existential policy area.
Thus, proposals under this topic should help reinvigorate democratic governance by suggesting pathways for improved effectiveness of rule-of-law based institutions and policies, notably pathways for open government practices that enable active civic participation throughout the policymaking process. They should help strengthen social and economic resilience and sustainability through a better understanding of the relationship between democratic governance and the climate imperative.
Proposals should use the lessons of history as well as analysis of the current situation and best practices to make policy recommendations for the future. In the light of existing tensions between democratic governance and climate imperatives, proposals should examine how societies have dealt with bottom-up participation in the past, whether more inclusive and politically democratic societies are better able to develop prevention and mitigation policies, and what new structures we need to tackle the climate imperative, to effectively address its complexity, urgency, and long-term impacts. Proposals are encouraged to consider social innovation activities to stimulate social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. Gender and intersectional aspects (e.g. ethnicity, social origin, migration background) should be considered, particularly regarding citizen engagement, civic participation, and climate literacy.
Proposals should seek synergies and complementarity with other clusters, partnerships and missions of the Horizon Europe Programme, notably the Clean Energy Transition Partnerships, as well as with other EU programmes and financing instruments to maximise its impact in the long term. Proposals within this call can be the needed link to get the project outcomes out of partnerships to the policymakers who can directly implement them for maximum effective results.

HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-06, Democratic governance for times of disruptive changes to the social contract,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Better understanding of ways to account for the need for evaluation and changes in the social contracts in the EU Member States countries through theoretical, philosophical, political, historical, legal, normative and comparative studies, amongst others.
?	Investigate and propose safeguards and mechanisms that need to be in place in those circumstances when questioning the very foundations of the social contract.
?	Scenarios for how new social contracts in EU Member States could look like or approaches for how to develop the narratives for new social contracts, accounting for the fact of the EU membership and the rights and duties that go with it.
Scope: A social contract is the intellectual construct referring to the agreement between members of a society, community, or organisation that spells out the obligations, functions, and rights of each citizen agreeing to the contract. The classic concept of social contract also implies the notion of the individual renunciation of some freedoms, in exchange for core public goods, including the right to democratic participation and the protection that societal life can offer. When the social contract fails to uphold its end of the bargain and leaves its citizens disappointed, there is a risk of social unrest and political instability. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed social and economic inequalities, leading to calls for a new social contract at national, EU and global levels based on inclusivity, participation and sustainability. Such calls may include requests for new articulations of the basic justifications, functions, rights and duties of democratic societies and their citizens likewise.
Some societies flourish while others struggle to maintain the social fabric, hardly avoiding the breakdown of their social contracts. Certain forms or configurations of the social contract appear more successful than others, and not necessarily because of their immutability or endurance. Instead, flexibility, adaptability, trust and resilience seem to be factors of success, in particular vis-…-vis external shocks or disruptive forces (a pandemic, abrupt technological changes, wars?). Such disruptions may hit a pre-exiting equilibrium, bringing to the light dimensions unforeseen by the existing social contract and putting it under stress. In such situations, the social contract could withstand, in the case of better prepared societies, and

continue delivering after necessary adaptations, or alternatively could break up, not resisting the pressure, and open the door to the establishment of a new contract through some dramatic or arduous exercise.
In order to identify the factors that drive, or contribute to, the social success of certain societies and their social contract models, proposals are invited to use narrative approaches (historical, legal, anthropological methods and analysis) or data-driven / computer-based approaches, or mixed approaches. In terms of the geographical scope of the research, proposals should focus on EU and/or MS societies, while international cooperation allowing comparative perspectives in view of extrapolations relevant to EU policies is also encouraged.

HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-07, Intersectionality and equality in deliberative and participatory democratic spaces,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Develop a thorough theoretical understanding of deliberative and participatory democratic practices through an intersectional lens that engages with structures of power, and identify limitations and opportunities for improvement of such spaces.
?	Enhance the design, implementation and evaluation of deliberative and participatory processes at different levels of government (local, regional, national, European), with a focus on marginalised and vulnerable communities, by including an intersectional approach that allows accounting for power relations at all processes of design.
?	Develop and pilot innovative designs for citizen engagement that consider intersectionality and allow for other types of participation and deliberation, and enhancing democracy, by addressing political inequality in such participatory spaces.

Scope: There has been a recent push to overcome the limits of representative democracy and reinvigorate democratic participation through participatory and deliberative democratic innovations at local, regional, national and European level. Such processes have aimed to bring power and decision making closer to citizens, and have contributed to reimagining the meaning of democracy and to further fostering the involvement of citizens in democratic life.
Nevertheless, difficulties remain as regards the meaningful involvement of minorities and marginalised communities. Despite the implementation of quotas and processes to ensure parity in such democratic spaces, ensuring equality has been proved to be a challenge. In many cases, when the principle of parity has been achieved, there has been a difficulty to ensure meaningful engagement and safe and equal spaces for all. And while many efforts are focused on better including under-represented groups into such spaces, less actions are targeted at making majority populations and non-marginalised communities more understanding and tolerant towards so-called, perceived 'Others'. Proposals should contribute to reinvigorating democracy and enhancing citizen participation by designing, envisioning and piloting processes of democratic innovation where overcoming the accumulation and intersection of discrimination or stigmatisation is a core part of the process.
For this, proposals should offer both conceptual and practical insights into designing, implementing and evaluating more inclusive participatory processes. Thus, research should help to identify the limitations of participatory exercises, and draw power analysis that provide insights into the systemic exclusion and reproduction of inequalities in certain democratic spaces. This could also include behavioural insights to enhance participation of marginalised groups and the deconstruction of biases or unwelcoming practices by majority groups and privileged communities. Furthermore, they should contribute to innovation through the piloting and testing of alternative models of participatory democratic practices and mini-publics that allow for meaningful engagement between marginalised or vulnerable communities and mainstream communities (counter/alternative publics, community deliberation, intercultural dialogues, multilevel deliberations, theatre and artistic interventions, etc.). In order to achieve the expected outcomes, social innovation should be considered. Proposals may consider the role of digital technologies in such innovative designs. Proposals may draw on the results of deliberative / participatory democracy related EU projects, in particular under Horizon 2020. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-DEMOCRACY-01-08, Political perspectives for the Eastern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Improvement of the European Union?s neighbourhood policy and accession process, thanks to a clear vision for the political agenda of the European Union towards the Eastern Neighbourhood countries and the Western Balkans, based on a deep and nuanced analytical basis.
?	Forecast and scenarios of the geopolitical ambitions of Russia, China and other countries towards the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and accession candidates.
?	Strengthened resilience and foreign policy arsenal of the European Union against military threats on the European continent thanks to policy recommendations.
Scope: The political and economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine go well beyond Ukrainian borders. The European Union had to change overnight from a neighbourhood policy focused on incremental reform to one that is about the survival of some Eastern Neighbourhood countries as independent, self-determined states. Ukraine?s application for European Union membership has been immediately replicated by Georgia and Moldova. Russian and Chinese influence in some accession candidate countries is on the rise. This opens crucial questions about the European Union?s enlargement strategy, requiring not only political answers but also academic reflection and expertise. Therefore, proposals are expected to analyse the European Union?s current neighbourhood and enlargement strategy and toolbox in the light of the new situation where military aggression or the threat with it and political exploitation of economic dependencies are once more used as foreign policy tools in Europe. Based on this, they should provide innovative perspectives on the origins and evolutions of policies aimed at stabilising and democratising the Eastern Neighbourhood along with evidence-based policy options to adapt this strategy to the new state of play.
Furthermore, in a context where an accelerated accession process is possible, there is need to strengthen mechanisms of compliance with the acquis in the area of social policies and to strengthen social cohesion to avoid brain drain and care drain in Eastern Partnership and Western Balkans countries.

Proposal are invited to take this dimension into account when developing robust evidence- based, forward-looking visions for the political agenda of the European Union towards the Eastern Neighbourhood and the Western Balkans.
In addition, the Russian ambition to have a sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union countries puts governments in the Eastern Neighbourhood in a much more vulnerable position. It increased their dependencies on big geopolitical powers, be it the West, China or Russia. It also highlighted Russia?s ambition to play an even more decisive political role in the larger region, including the power to install governments of its choice through a return to Cold War tactics. Is this shift back to brutal military intervention the sign of a new age in international relations and new geopolitical blocks? Proposals are expected to analyse and forecast possible scenarios regarding Russia, but also China and other countries? geopolitical ambitions towards the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood, grounded in a historical perspective. Based on sound and robust analyses, they should provide policy recommendations, scenarios and options to strengthen the Union?s resilience and diplomatic arsenal in a potential new era of military intervention on the continent. They are also expected to provide evidence-based advice on whether European Union should factor military interventions into its foreign policy toolbox, and offer perspectives as to what implications that would entail.
Proposals are strongly encouraged to involve stakeholders, including non-state actors and citizens, from the countries in the topic scope. The consortium must include at least one entity from the following countries: Georgia, Republic of Moldova or Ukraine. Legal entities from these countries must take part in the project as beneficiaries.
Participation of Ukrainian researchers in exile with refugee status and employed by eligible beneficiaries is strongly encouraged and would be an asset.
International cooperation is strongly encouraged.

Proposals are encouraged to network with and build on previously funded projects under the Horizon Europe calls18, Horizon 2020 or other EU programmes, e.g. Global Europe 19, as appropriate.

HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-01, Protest politics and cultures of opposition in democracy,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Practical understanding of the role and evolution of all forms of opposition (protest, cultural opposition, non-compliance, subversion, activism), their different platforms (physical and online), and their impact on democracy, including in resisting the rise of authoritarian tendencies and in taking down authoritarian regimes.
?	Policy recommendations based on a deep analysis of the potential shift from traditional party structures to social mobilisation and activist as means for democratic participation, including drivers and factors that might play a role in fostering such forms of politics.
?	Innovative forms of non-conflictual constructive engagement, which can channel social and community mobilisation and protest resulting from lack of/limited channels for democratic civic engagement and collective political action.
?	Rebuilding citizens? trust in the impact and validity of electoral processes at various levels.
Scope: Citizens increasingly disengage from traditional party politics and voting as a way to express political views, values and beliefs. On the other hand, recent years have seen diverse forms of political protest, social and artistic movements and activism, flourish both offline and online. In fact, the Eurobarometer Youth Survey 2021 showed that a majority of young people in Ireland, Spain and Belgium, amongst others, consider participating in forms of street politics equal to, or more effective, than voting.
Research proposals under this topic should analyse further the shift towards politics of collective action, and their impact on European democracies, including their role in resisting the rise of authoritarian tendencies and in taking down authoritarian regimes. This could refer to both online and offline forms of collective political action, including artistic forms of protest (audiovisual art, literature, music, etc.). Proposals should consider drivers and factors that play a role in fostering such forms of politics (emotional, gender, socioeconomic, cultural, historical, generational, geopolitical, etc.), including the role of social media platforms. This should be contextualised in a historical study of the role of protest movements and their impact on democracy. Proposals may analyse local, regional, national as well as transnational movements, mobilisation, and democracy within the European Union.
Proposals should consider the relationship between (i) collective action as a way to channel democratic grievances and (ii) limited channels for citizen participation, thus analysing the implications of further citizen support for democracy combined with the dissatisfaction with the current democratic channels (with a special focus on accessibility and inclusiveness of

democratic channels such as voting for vulnerable people, mobile citizens, migrants, etc.). This could also mean exploring self-organised alternative forms of citizen participation (such as assemblies) and other innovative forms of non-conflictual constructive engagement.
The growing defiance towards the ?usefulness? of voting and electoral processes should also be addressed. Voting abstention as a mean to protest against a perceived lack of options, and how to remediate disengagement with electoral processes, can be a particular focus. Proposals should propose concrete paths to rebuild citizens? trust in the impact and validity of electoral processes at various level, from local to European.
Special attention could be put on younger generations, who have vastly participated in shaping the public sphere with their activism in movements such as Pride, Fridays for Future and feminist mobilisations. A focus could also be on violence and extremist movements? influence, for instance on protests against COVID-19 public health measures. How social networks act as a factor to increase societal resilience and as a way to pressure political change could also be investigated. Finally, how formal education contexts are integrating these new manifestations into citizenship education could also be explored. As new forms of political participation are still very much urban-based, proposals should include a specific focus on how to constructively channel rural youth?s discontent.
Proposals are encouraged to make use of participative methodologies and to draw on a combination of methods and literature.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with countries from the MENA region.

HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-02, Multilevel governance in times of digital and climate transitions,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Encourage international cooperation through better understanding of the articulation between local, regional, international and transnational governance.
?	Encourage the development and implementation of policy in two areas of transnational and multi-level importance: the digital and climate transitions, also taking into account how does the division of policy ownership in multi-level governance systems impact the effectiveness of policymaking in these two policy areas.
?	Lead to better-informed decision-making and policy implementation at national and EU levels, based on the identification of where the tensions and the opportunities are in top- down and bottom-up policymaking. The development of community-based innovations in the field of democratic governance and processes, notably at the level of cities and regions, and evaluation of their implications for social development, cohesion and inclusion.
?	Provide policy recommendations on improvements and alternative pathways for the national and local implementation of EU law that are endorsed by the targeted public administrations, including through experimentation in deliberative processes.
Scope: The threat of climate change will require changes in the ways in which we organise our societies, action at all levels of government, and coordination between these levels so that actions are taken at the most appropriate one and complement each other effectively. Optimising complementarity will also be important to face the challenge of staff shortage to tackle the climate transition.
The digital transition is also at the heart of the question of multi-level governance of major transitions: for instance, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practices, and shown that further paths can be followed in order for digitalisation to be moulded to benefit the climate, and society.
The EU Green Deal and digital strategy, and their national and local implementation strategies, are the policy roadmaps to be examined under this topic.
Proposals should analyse how different levels of government in the EU work in developing and implementing policy on the digital and climate transitions. Where is collaboration and collective agenda-setting most effective, in order for climate and digital roadmap goals to be met? How does the division of policy ownership in multi-level governance systems impact the effectiveness of policymaking in these two policy areas: where are the gaps, and where are the duplications? Questions of responsiveness and legitimacy might also be considered.
Proposals should also analyse the development of community-based innovations in the field of democratic governance and processes, notably at the level of cities and regions, and evaluation of their implications for social development, cohesion and inclusion.

Given the very particular situation of border regions, proposals could analyse innovative legal instruments, organisational set-ups, cross-border democratic processes that strengthen cross- border cooperation and ultimately the resilience of cross-border territories.
As the innovation action part of this RIA, proposals should experiment with community-led innovations in one or both policy areas, such as through deliberative processes, or engaging social innovation partners and citizens representatives.
Based on this analysis, proposals should suggest pathways for better-informed decision-making at national and EU levels based on the identification of where the tensions the opportunities are in top-down and bottom-up policymaking, and policy implementation.
Proposals should form partnerships with government authorities at the relevant levels, in order for their policy recommendations on improvements and alternative pathways for the national and local implementation of EU law to be more likely to be endorsed by the targeted public administrations.",
HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-03, What is the long-term impact of rule of law and European values on socio-economic outcomes?,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Policy recommendations based on a better understanding of the impact of rule of law and other European Union values on socio-economic outcomes of individuals and nations.
?	Enhanced knowledge of the social cost aspects of debilitating rule of law and robust quantification strategies in the area of rights and freedoms in the national and European context.
?	New datasets for this area of research, incorporating a systematic use of historical experiences, economic and econometric history approaches in conjunction with legal and political history analysis, where adequate.
Scope: Recent insights into the role of networks for the creation of value (for instance, the use of network models by human resources departments to estimate existing or future staff value, or the use of network theories to enrich the understanding of financial systems and related risks) have yet to be transferred in an important manner to areas of study dealing with important

public/common goods such as rule of law and the various human and fundamental rights and freedoms established by European Union law. It is well understood that networks can amplify asset values in an important manner. How do structural features and metrics of societal networks impact that value of common/public goods? Is it possible to identify similar magnifying effects? And how can they be measured, in which unit can they be expressed? On the other hand value created within one particular network may not be transferable to another network without significant losses. What factors will determine the importance of such losses?
Variables under scrutiny may go beyond those used in the European Commission?s annual Rule of Law Report (variables such as baskets of opportunities, capabilities, etc.) as well as areas of outcomes that do not figure in this report and yet have important impacts on justice and inequality.
In addition, networks can also create value for individuals and clubs (club goods) that transfer the benefits of public goods (such as tax-funded education in elite institutions) to individual families, specific social groups and their descendants. Such social and economic captures, which have always existed, persist and in many cases have become stronger over time, thus reinforcing inequalities in the modern age. Similarly, the value of environmental public goods/commons might benefit only better off residents of certain types of cities. Such examples can be multiplied. Proposals should also map this type of value creation in a quantitative manner.
Proposals should explore changing valuation of public/common goods depending on different network topologies. They should investigate how are metrics of social (persons, individuals, not social media networks) and contractual (private contracts, private trades) networks associated with varying valuations public/common goods. Based on that, proposals should improve knowledge of the social cost aspects of debilitating rule of law. They should provide robust quantification strategies in the area of rights and freedoms in the national and European context.
Proposals should investigate historical developments to provide better understanding of present situation and present challenges.

?	Provide a comprehensive analysis of the interrelations between social, cultural and political identities, the sense of belonging and identification with a group, and democracy, including in matters of political representation, participation and trust. This includes considering the intersecting, fluid and fragmented dimension of identities and their relation to the need to belong as well as values.
?	Build on findings to formulate policy recommendations to address, prevent and correct negative trends, including piloting of strategies and frameworks to prevent discrimination, marginalisation and alienation. Insights on how to contribute to encompassing identities with concrete policy recommendations are highly encouraged.
?	Develop critical insights into the ways in which processes of social, cultural and political participation can contribute to further fostering the sense of belonging/ownership to local, national and European democratic institutions and processes, or the diffusion of antagonistic identities or social norms.
Scope: The role of identities and the sense of belonging in democracies is of uttermost importance, where both have been key to define and understand political participation in democratic societies. In the past few years, Europe has arguably experienced an increased fragmentation of identities, given rapid generational, demographic, social, religious and political changes. Simultaneously, the pandemic has highlighted the importance of communities in times of uncertainty. This has opened up questions about the negative impact that such fragmenting trends might have on democratic life, as well as the barriers that certain groups face to be actively and meaningfully engaged in democratic participation, among these youths, migrants, and LBTQI+ collectives.
On the other hand, it can be argued that the involvement of certain communities in democratic processes of decision-making (through quotas, but also through other participatory processes at different levels such as participants sortation) can contribute to further foster the sense of belonging to a democratic society, and further increase their participation in democratic life.
In this context, proposals should help further investigate the way that democracy and its key tenets such as political representation, participation or trust are interrelated to social, cultural, and political identities and a sense of belonging and identification with different communities. This includes gender, ethnic, multicultural, multilingual and spatial identities and subjectivities,

amongst others, taking into account the cumulative effects of discrimination. To better understand social identities and their role in shaping political and social discourse, proposals could consider the condition of migration and refugees, segregation as well as inclusion; the notion of European identity and heritage; people with disabilities; perception of belonging to urban/rural communities, to local communities or to diasporas; the role of media and social media in identity fragmentation, mixtures of ethnic, political and religious identities; the role of the cultural and artistic sectors in representing the diversity of identities (cinema, film series, literature, etc.).
Proposals should identify and explore barriers and factors that limit or impact the engagement of certain communities in democratic practices and processes, and erode their political participation, representation or trust in democratic institutions. Moreover, they should consider and propose policies, frameworks and recommendations to prevent and revert such negative trends, as well as ways to further foster the sense of belonging to democratic societies. This could include the piloting of participatory processes or civic engagement activities targeted at identifying and discussing the issues underpinning the sense of democratic belonging in said communities. Identities do not happen in a vacuum. People are attached to groups that grant them an identity that has currency in the social domain: being identified as a member of a certain group grants social capital. They belong to groups they value and that cater to their social and psychological needs. Proposals should therefore also develop critical insights into the ways in which processes of social, cultural and political participation can contribute to further fostering the sense of belonging/ownership to local, national and European democratic institutions and processes.
Finally, proposals may also study social representations and intergroup stereotypes, which determine to which groups individuals choose to belong. The benefits of group membership and identification, including the social capital that comes with group projects as an inherent part of social representations, may also be analysed. In that regard, the role of identification and belonging in the diffusion of antagonistic identities or social norms online and offline should be studied.
It is important that proposals integrate an intersectional, historical, fluid and multiple approach towards identities, as well as consider the varying concepts and experiences of ?belonging? and ?identification?, as well as the possibility to develop several feelings of belonging to different communities simultaneously.
Proposals should also utilise participatory methods for research, involving academic and non- academic actors, with a focus on community empowerment. They might utilise methodologies that build on disciplines such as political and social psychology, behavioural politics, history, sociology, gender and race theories, religious studies, post-colonial studies, etc.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this topic and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged. Proposals may consider social innovation activities to stimulate social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake",

?	Develop a critical understanding of the construction and performance of gender roles in extremist, identitarian and nationalist movements and their impact on democracy, EU values and fundamental rights.
?	Provide evidence-based insights into the role of online communities in the promotion of reactionary, identitarian and extremist ideals, focusing in particular on different forms of masculinity from an intersectional perspective and drawing on engagement with these communities and platforms.
?	Examine gender roles in political leadership styles and narratives, especially in nationalist and extremist parties, and their impact on democratic participation, decision-making and trust in governance, and propose alternative models for more democratic leadership.
?	Develop innovative methods, policy approaches and tools to tackle antidemocratic narratives and tendencies, characterised by identitarian, nationalist and extremist ideals.
Scope: While gender and feminist scholarship in democracy tends to focus on the role of women and female representation, the role of men and different forms of masculinity are equally important to gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of gender roles and inequalities on democratic discourse, decision-making and governance.
The past years have witnessed a rise of identitarian (alt-right), reactionary and other extremist politics, arguably strengthened by the pandemic and the isolation it created. Many of these ideals and politics are developing in online forums and platforms, often characterised by a contempt for the ?liberal? elite and perceived as tools for the radicalisation of (young) men. In extreme cases, such politics have been openly hostile towards women, LGBTQI+ collectives and ethnic minorities, and even openly advocated for violence towards them, leading to increased hate speech, harassment, and hate crimes. More research is needed into these groups and milieus, especially through active engagement and deliberation with them on their perceptions around socio-political change, fundamental rights, and anxiety about perceived threats to their gendered identity. Therefore, proposals should develop strategies and practical

solutions for the engagement and deliberation with men involved in reactionary, identitarian, or far-right nationalist online forums, and examine the influence of the online discourse in such platforms on the constitution of extremist movements, as well as their relation to mainstream (online) platforms and political discourse. This includes, but is not limited to, an analysis and engagement with different types of masculinity, how these relate to political violence, gender- based violence, and hate crimes, and perceptions around EU values and socio-political change. Interdisciplinary approaches, connecting social and political sciences with the use of information and communication technologies, including artificial intelligence, are particularly encouraged for this topic.
Moreover, the increased uncertainty and political challenges generated by the pandemic, has been coupled with a turn towards hyper-masculinistic modes of leadership and politics that require further analysis. In this context, proposals should consider the interrelation between top- down hyper-masculinistic leadership styles and bottom-up identitarian, nationalist and other extremist movements developing in online spaces, and analyse their impact on democratic participation, decision-making and trust in governance. Historical experiences of leadership and politics in crisis situations may also be considered in this regard.
Building on the evidence-based insights, proposals should develop innovative methods, policy approaches and tools for policymakers and practitioners to address the underlying roots of violent, discriminatory and illiberal political discourse and actions in both public and online spaces. This could include awareness-raising and training activities on the threats of identitarian and reactionary ideals for democracy and EU values, as well as innovative practices to deliberate with the targeted communities.
Proposals are encouraged to build on past EU-funded projects as well as plan to exploit potential synergies with project(s) funded under HORIZON-CL3-2024-FCT-01-04: Radicalisation and gender",
HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-06, Computational Social Science approaches in research on democracy,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Insights into various aspects of democracy, its institutions, its capacity to adapt to changing circumstances, interaction with structural socio-economic patterns utilising

Computational Social Science 22 (CSS) to identify systematic patterns to test working hypotheses.
?	Develop and test methodologies that combine and integrate CSS and other SSH methods to study democratic governance, overcoming traditional academic boundaries in the field and producing synthetic data and simulation environments to stage full scale experiments which otherwise are reserved to historical study.
?	Use of critical approaches to data and datafication of social data, the development of alternative approaches to research including critical software studies, digital studies, and critical media studies, and development of clear and concise policy recommendations for harmonising CSS approaches with GDPR guidelines in order to encourage and facilitate such studies.
Scope: Social sciences have not yet fully embraced the breakthrough of computational science that took place in past years with costs for data transport and data storage ceasing to be a limiting factor for data-driven social science. Developing new crosscutting tools of social and computational science will indeed contribute to better understanding how the EU society acts.
At the same time, although big data (including personal data) has become widespread and minable, datasets available to researchers for scientific enquiry are not so easily available, only under restricted regimes, or they vary in quality. Another important limitation to using these datasets is the respect of data protection regulations put in place by the European Union legislation (for instance GDPR). With CSS it could be critically examined where there is need for more data access to what kind of data, and also where there is not enough high quality data at all. Proposals are therefore expected to propose new strategies and approaches on how to deal with data, and the lack thereof, in a way that fully complies with the EU?s notion of privacy and personal data.
A promising avenue in this respect is the creation and use for research of synthetic data sets, including full-scale synthetic reference populations. Those can link, while not interfering with personal data use restrictions, highly granular data set. As a result, empirical analysis can much better cater for distributional impacts across a wide range of types of households, and individual socio-economic backgrounds, and the impact of socio-economic policies in different geographical settings can be studied at the same level of detail as currently the case in environmental studies.
Thematically, proposals may chose whichever research focus, in the area of democracy, deemed relevant to exploit the potential of CCS. They may concentrate on testing age-old questions of political economy and political sociology and see how they change or survive when tested in a highly granular simulation environment, as synthetic population data allows to do, or they may identify more recent topics such as political communication, political participation, or resilience of democracies, in relation to structural socio-economic patterns. They may also do

methodological research with access to new data sources, develop new methods, or refine existing ones, like social network analysis.
Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly in the context of real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide ?FAIR-by-design? data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. Proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces in the data-driven analyses. Additionally, efforts should be made to increase the data availability in European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud by depositing generated data in relevant infrastructures.

HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-07, Digital democracy,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Policymakers, practitioners and researchers gain increased understanding of digital democracy, the challenges and opportunities involved in digital democratic deliberations, the current state of the art and the framework conditions supporting its successful implementation.
?	Informed investment decisions of (any level) government based on mapping future trends, emerging next practices, related participation culture and engagement strategies for building a thriving digitally enhanced public sphere in Europe.
Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic made e-democracy more relevant and influential than ever before since access to the physical public sphere was limited. Through digital platforms and

social media, individuals continue to voice their opinions, expose and mobilise for social movements, fostering change and raising awareness of democracy and fundamental rights. Citizens turned to digital media and collaborative platforms to deal with public affairs, exercising active citizenship virtually. Digital democracy platforms expand the opportunities for democratic deliberations through better and faster political information exchange, public dialogue, engagement in public decision-making and exercising voting rights in political elections. Digital democracy can also play an active role in creating and deepening societal change. However, digital solutions are also more vulnerable to disruption e.g. cybersecurity and privacy threats, misinformation campaigns or digital lobbying, attempting to impact public decision making, including political election outcomes, and is likely to bring important ethical challenges concerning digital education and digital literacy, access to information, built-in bias, etc.
Increased level of participation between government and citizens requires radical changes and major investment making public administrations more relevant to the social, economic, political and technological environment. To prepare public administrations for increased engagement with the broader public, structures and processes need to be put in place, human and financial resources allocated, an ecosystem of intermediaries and representative organisations defined, most suited technological solutions identified, making public deliberation and moderation in the digital age an integral part of a governmental and also societal ?culture of participation?.
For this aim, proposals should investigate - building on existing literature and data - the most recent developments, especially as regards the pandemic-induced innovative e-democracy and e-participation solutions at all levels of governance (international, EU, national, regional, local). Historical analysis will allow the consideration of the wider and long-term impacts of e- participation on democracy, political and civic culture, and international cooperation will facilitate the exchange of good practice and success stories. The framework conditions i.e. rules, policies and processes; ways of working (partnerships, structures, collaboration); people (skills, culture and values, leadership); knowledge (data, learning) that support next level democratic participation (emerging and next practices) should be investigated. Research should pay particular attention to digital inclusion as a key challenge and essential element of inclusive citizen participation in public deliberations for a healthy digitally enabled democracy through equal participation irrespective of citizen's income level, education, ethnicity, gender, religion, language used, physical impairment, etc., and to the digital divide between generations.
Based on lessons learnt from existing good practice cases and experiences, proposals should consider the citizens? perspectives in building digital democracy tools and processes, including related technical aspects (e.g. gamification, artificial intelligence). The involvement of different stakeholders, including public administrations, end-users, political actors and the private sector is strongly encouraged to foster dialogue and understanding between diverse interest groups in democratic deliberations, enhance the legal frameworks and safeguards against threats and challenges (e.g. fraud prevention in e-voting), overcoming polarisation and reaching better public policy outcomes",

?	Recommendations on how to foster civic participation through a deep analysis of the use of spaces beyond classic democratic institutions, especially cultural and artistic spaces, as well as cyberspace and metaverses, for political expression.
?	Forward-looking policy recommendations to ensure that digital spaces (including metaverses and social networks) can, by design, have a positive impact on democratic life and limit potential threats to democracy.
?	Experimentation of solutions, methods and tools to support democratic behaviour and social well-being for the next generation of social media.
Scope: Participation in political life through conventional means, such as elections, has become a challenge. Participation rates decrease while parts of society feel unheard by political elites and see electoral processes as inefficient.
On the other hand, some citizens find alternative outlets to express political opinions, such as protests23, expression on social media and in virtual spaces, art creation, music and vocal forms of expressive culture, etc. Cultural, artistic and online spaces (such as public libraries, art exhibition spaces, heritage sites, cultural centres, parks and other public places used temporarily to convey a message, social media platforms, metaverses, etc.) are increasingly positioning themselves as catalysers for social and economic changes. They become privileged places for deliberation and alternative engagement with politics through debate, education and free expression, for instance. Proposals should evaluate how effective they are at channelling


23	See, under the same call, HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-01: Protest politics and cultures of opposition in democracy.

bottom-up political energy. They should also propose options as to how those alternative initiatives could feed into the wider political debate (for instance through social innovation). In addition, proposals could look at art and cultural productions (in the broader sense, online and offline) as vectors of political expression, be it in democratic or non-democratic contexts. How efficient are they in mediating political messages? What kind of attacks and counter-attacks are targeted at them, with what effects, from the side of the professional politicians and organisations? How are questions regarding the legitimacy of artistic activities answered?
Aside from physical spaces, virtual spaces for exchange and communication have been very active in the dissemination of political views and have influenced the political debate, notably through the use of popular culture references (memes, etc.) and through cyber-culture. While the link between social media and disinformation as well as political engagement has already been investigated, the revival of virtual alternative universes, such as metaverses, begs for more scientific evidence regarding what impact this will have on democracy. Digital universes have a strong potential to both threaten and nurture democracies. Proposals should propose forward- looking policy recommendations to ensure that such digital spaces can, by design, have a positive impact on democratic life, and to limit the potential threats to democracy. How can these new spaces be exploited as positive tools for citizen engagement? Proposals should also experiment solutions, methods and tools to support democratic behaviour and well-being for the next generation of social media.
Proposals are expected to investigate cultural activity and engagement, online and offline, as political expression, civic participation and political engagement, historically, in contemporary society, and to provide forecasts for the future. Gender, decoloniality and intersectionality should be taken into account. Investigation of examples and initiatives from outside Europe will be instrumental, given the many interesting experiences of art and activism around the world. Therefore, international cooperation is encouraged. Proposals should produce concrete policy recommendations and design proposals to allow the potential for political engagement through physical and virtual non-traditional spaces to be fully expressed, in an inclusive manner.
Research methodologies should include field research and participative methods. They may also involve culture and art practitioners and art-based research.

?	Better understanding of the changing concept and practices of public administrations and approaches to public management, emerging trends and paradigm shifts, and the role public institutions and public management play in in fostering democratic, economic and social stability.
?	Mapping emerging innovative solutions in public management and institutional framework conditions (e.g. human resource management policies, leadership, new ways of working, changing public decision- and policymaking, etc.) that enable innovation in public administrations and deepen democratic governance.
?	Recommendations for European Union Member States on key focus areas and (from local to EU level) actions as regards public administration modernisation and reform agendas, and whole-government innovation strategies for effective, innovative, future-capable and citizen-centric government administrations in Europe.
Scope: Governments are excessively under pressure today to adapt and respond to rapidly changing global economic, social, political, ecological and technological trends, to develop better public policy outcomes and high-quality public services that respond to the needs of their citizens, and to transform their internal operations on the go, creating modern and innovative public administrations. This area of research intends to investigate how European Union governments are approaching public administration and governance reform i.e. what areas they strategically invest in, what challenges they encounter, what (national, European or international) support (expertise, finance) they capitalise on, and how they generally approach transforming their government administrations (through e.g. systems approaches, open government approaches, innovation portfolio approach, organisational framework conditions enabling innovation, etc.) as they face the challenges of today.
The true measure of the successful practice of public service lies in the ability of government administrations to remain faithful to the tenets of democratic society (e.g. respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities). Therefore, particular attention should be paid to the role and functioning of public institutions in democratic systems, their role in fostering democratic,

economic and social stability, and in reforming public management and institutions in ways that enhance citizens? trust in government and active participation in public affairs [e.g. engagement with citizens, open and transparent public decision- and policymaking, e- democracy, participatory and deliberative democracy, experimentation, working with innovation ecosystems (Quadruple and Quintuple Helix models), etc.], including emerging visions and narratives for public management and institutions.
To this effect, beyond the available literature review and internationally comparable data (e.g. World Economic Forum, United Nations, World Bank, European institutions, etc.), this research will need to involve intensive engagement with national government officials orchestrating and engaged in internal innovation processes, large-scale data collection and analysis, and drawing up illustrative cases from European Union Member States and OECD governments actively working towards improving democratic governance and innovation in government administrations",
HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-10, Political participation in multilingual spaces,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Development of a European public space for citizen deliberation through a better understanding of the tools and mechanisms that can overcome barriers to political participation in multilingual spaces.
?	Better management of linguistic diversity in political participation, from the local to the European level.
?	Effective use of automated language tools and multilingual means of communication, through analysis of these tools and their impact on democracy-fostering processes.

Scope: The European Union is made up of a population with a multitude of languages (including sign languages) and dialects, which reflect a mosaic of cultures in constant interaction and evolution. Although this is not new, managing political participation in multilingual spaces is a challenge, particularly with a view to creating a European public space for citizen deliberation.
The Conference on the Future of Europe has shown that solutions exist to facilitate multilingual communication in a democratic context, including thanks to the use of automated translation tools. However, multi-lingual deliberations tend to crystallise on ensuring that opinions have been rightly conveyed through translation rather than on the outcomes of the discussions and the understanding of cultural codes and perceptions. In other words, how to ensure that multilingual deliberations focus on the content, rather than the form of what is said? How to allow deep and meaningful engagement among participants from diverse linguistic communities? Technological tools may help in virtual settings, but how can these technical innovations be brought into the non-virtual world, in order to address such a deep-rooted societal challenge?
In addition, multilingual spaces are almost always also multicultural. In other words, the translation process is never limited only to translation between language(s), but involves also intercultural translation. How would it be possible to ensure that notions of identity and belonging at the local, national and European level, be coupled with democratic, open and trusting societies? What role can inter-cultural dimensions of social capital and social dialogue play in strengthening democratic dialogue and on building democratic communities and citizenship (at the national and EU level)?
Proposals should consider outcomes from the Conference on the Future of Europe. They should explore how deliberations in multilingual settings can be best mediated, by design or through technological assistance. Special attention could be paid to linguistic minorities and people with communication impairments. Proposals under this call are encouraged to make use of participative methodologies and experimental methods. Proposals are encouraged to consider social innovation activities to stimulate social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

?	Future scenario workflows, roadmap and strategy playbook to achieve the most preferred scenarios for democracy in the European Union 2040, researched, debated and co- developed through iterative, large-scale engagement processes with diverse groups of stakeholders i.e. young European citizens, political and institutional actors and organised civil society.
Scope: Democracy in the EU faces challenges from rising extremism and polarisation, covert authoritarianism, election interference and the spread of manipulative information. Political democracies are looking for new balances in fast-changing societal contexts while facing countless number of internal and global challenges and changes in power relations. This ? in turn ? reduces the willingness to undertake reforms that could deepen the European Union further. Nationalistic and populistic tendencies, tensions between national and international frameworks, political and social polarisation jeopardise established values and practices (e.g. parliamentary democracy, the rule of law, separation of powers, democratic dialogue, etc.) and seem to weaken the political clout of the European Union in the long run.
In light of the current discourse about the need to rethink and redesign virtual and real public spaces and civic engagement, this research will also investigate the future of democracy and its instruments, and will also explore the views of political institutions such as national parliaments and the European Institutions, and those of organised civil society actors as regards their visions for the future, emerging trends such as e.g. participatory and deliberative democracy models that better serve the public good, build trust between governments and citizens, and deepen democracy at large. Particular attention should be paid to the development of future European (and national) public spaces that mutually support one another and work together, and the evolution of the current EU model (with its peculiarities and often quoted democratic deficit) into its best potential.
With the accelerating complexity of change, there is a growing need to combine solid scientific forecasting methods that rely on objective historical data with qualitative and speculative foresight practices, and with a series of iterative, large-scale (online and in-person) engagements in order to build and co-develop alternative future scenarios that can empower young people living in the EU to proactively shape their collective future in the European Union. In addition, proposals should help to understand the visions of the next generation and how to provide them with the tools to put those visions in practice. It is important to document (e.g. the making-of film, documentary, library of video interviews, etc.) the journey undertaken

over time from research through large-scale stakeholder engagements, debates and co- development of outcomes for European citizens to engage with the content as the project is progressing and after its conclusion.",

such earlier projects in a practical / real life context, that allow to replicate the methods, recommendations for legislative changes, or translate the research results into innovations.
Scope: The aim is to bring to society the benefits from previously EU-funded research in the field of democracy and governance be it in Horizon 2020 or other relevant programmes (such as Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme or the Global Europe Programme). The proposals have to build on the rich stock of actionable recommendations, knowledge, toolkits, educational material, and scientific methods etc. developed in particular by the over 300 Horizon 2020 projects on democracy and governance related issues. For proposals building on Global Europe research in particular, cooperation with third countries is encouraged.
Proposals have to credibly identify a targeted democracy and/or governance related issue that can be addressed by implementing existing research and innovation results. In addition, proposals should take those research and innovation results further through testing and experimenting in the relevant operational environment, and enhancing the potential take-up of innovative solutions by civil society, public institutions, including educational institutions, and policymakers at all governance levels, including in third countries. Potential instruments for this testing, such as twinning or the launch of open calls for pilots, are possible through financial support to third parties. Proposals suggesting financial support to third parties should lay out the selection criteria that will be used. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the need or interest for the solution they propose by involving end-users in the project design. Proposals should also provide a clear pathway to impact as well as a comprehensive risk assessment plan with different mitigation strategies.
Proposals should address issues in line with the European Democracy Action Plan or EU policy initiatives that emanated from this Action Plan.
Possibilities of coordination with related activities funded through in particular the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values Programme or the Global Europe Programme should be analysed. Cooperation should be sought with the Network for innovative solutions for the future of democracy funded under HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-02-01..
Proposals should involve end-users (including civil society organisations) and/or strategic partners who can foster the societal impact of the research and innovation results. Possible end- users and strategic partners could include for instance local or regional authorities, schools/universities, cultural institutions, civil society, foundations, political parties, trade unions, or youth organisations. Proposals should also involve practitioners and experts in science communication.
Besides fostering the societal impact of previous democracy and governance related research and innovation actions, proposals should explore and draw lessons on how the translation between research results in this field and policy actions takes place and what kinds of expertise is needed for achieving this. Proposals could also develop strategies to promote citizens activism and community engagement to build inclusive societies",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-01, Advanced technologies for remote monitoring of heritage monuments and artefacts,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,3.00 to 4.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	New and innovative remote methods to monitor the state of degradation of original materials of cultural heritage monuments, buildings and artefacts.
?	Innovative on site monitoring methods of pollutants and the status of previous interventions in cultural heritage buildings, monuments and artefacts in order to select the optimal green and effective conservation strategies and material.
Scope: Cultural heritage monuments, sites and artefacts are threatened by a variety of natural anthropogenic and environmental factors such as earthquakes, floods or sea level rise, fires, atmospheric pollution, urbanisation and man-made threats. Innovative advanced and cost effective remote technologies for systematic and representative monitoring of built cultural heritage monuments? and artefacts state of preservation are needed, addressing limitations of location size and transportability.
Remote technologies with emphasis on non-destructive techniques should focus on obtaining analytical chemical information regarding pollutants and/or degradation products from previous interventions in monuments, buildings or large size cultural objects, which are not easily accessible or in remote places for representative sampling. Remote chemical mapping should be included too.
For onsite studies of the chemical or structural state of cultural heritage items (monuments, buildings, artefacts), a toolbox of chemical probes (e.g. fiber optics sensors?), assays and technologies should be adapted. These may include:
?	Novel transportable equipment for rapid in situ chemical analysis and/or mapping of pollutants and/or degradation products including, when necessary, data from previous interventions. This is crucial not only for monuments or buildings but also for assessing the state of valuable artworks and artefacts in museums, which are difficult or of enhanced danger if removed.
?	Sensors (including embedded sensors), interferometric or photoacoustic technologies for systematic monitoring of the structural integrity of monuments, buildings and artefacts are also important for their early protection or for determining proactively interventions in response to natural disasters (earthquakes, extreme climate or anthropogenic effects, etc.).

?	Enhanced and updated understanding of the challenges and opportunities for the cultural and creative industries (CCIs)30 in relation to a sustainable climate transition.

?
?	Research and knowledge based approach(es) on how innovative business models, including use of new technology, can make Europe?s CCIs true drivers of a sustainable climate transition.
?	Significant contributions to help European CCIs become better prepared to adapt to and contribute to the climate transition in line with the 2030 goals spelled out under a European Green Deal31.
Scope: The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) are an important source of growth and job creation in the European economy. Moreover, the CCIs play a key role in shaping culture, values and perceptions across the European Union and beyond. Thus, the role of the CCIs in achieving the European Union?s climate transition objectives is crucial.
At the same time, the CCIs are characterised by a large and diverse number of chiefly small and micro enterprises, as well as by hefty differences across geographical and sectorial divides. Large parts of the CCIs, thus, lack the capacity to take the necessary measures to adapt to and thrive under the climate transition, not to speak of driving this transition.
Specific approaches are therefore needed to enable Europe?s CCIs to develop their full potential to support a sustainable climate transition.
Proposals should provide for developing and validating an economically sustainable model, or a portfolio of approaches, that address this challenge. A suitable set of CCI sector(s) or/and cross-sectoral issues should be selected to focus on, which allow significant impacts to be achieved.

The approach(es) developed should address the adoption of new sustainable business models, including the use of new technologies and possibly the development or adaption of new technological solutions, as well as gaps in skills and capacities. The proposed models should be valid across different Member States/Associated Countries (where appropriate including regions), and address the needs of small, micro as well as larger companies. Different Member States/Associated Countries should therefore be involved, as well as a wide set of stakeholders including concerned policymakers, in order to ensure that solutions developed are effective and realistic.
Solutions may involve the use of platforms or networks to facilitate sharing investments, facilities or competencies among several companies or across sectors. In such cases, established platforms, networks or clusters for CCIs should be taken into account, to avoid duplication of efforts.
Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. Furthermore, links should be established and synergies sought with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. In particular, when appropriate cooperation with projects funded under the topic ?Cultural and creative industries for a sustainable climate transition? of the Horizon Europe Cluster 2 2024 calls should be sought",

?	Increased critical understanding of the potential, opportunities, barriers and risks of digitising cultural heritage.
?	Research and knowledge based recommendations and/or method(s) on how the European cultural heritage sector can better manage digitisation of their collections, including setting priorities, ensuring the correct context is reflected on the digital objects created, and guaranteeing their long term durability.

?	Validated framework(s) that support the cultural heritage sector to make best use of their digital assets, in order to reap the full benefits of the digital transition and avoid the pitfalls.
?	Significant contributions to help European cultural heritage institutions become more digitally adept, capable of capitalising fully on the opportunities of digital cultural heritage.
Scope: The cultural heritage sector, as the rest of society, finds itself in the midst of a dramatic digital transition. This transition deeply affects its activities, its organisation, and at times the purpose or existence of its institutions and subsectors.
A key component of European and national cultural heritage policy has been, and is, the digitisation and subsequent broad access to cultural heritage32. Large sums have been invested by the European Union and Member States to digitise collections, monuments and buildings, and more will follow.
Digitisation of cultural heritage can bring many benefits. In terms of research, preservation, accessibility and of supporting cultural and creative innovation, digitised cultural heritage can be an enormous asset. One of the reasons why these large investments are made is that such digitised objects facilitate a wider, more creative use of Europe?s world-renowned cultural heritage, and the creation of more societal value in Europe and beyond.
However, along with the benefits of digitising cultural heritage come pitfalls. One risk may be that digitised cultural heritage is used, or misused, out of its context.
Libraries, museums and archives, as well as other collections, often have long histories. Both the collections they house and the language they use(d) to describe these collections are products of that historical legacy. Taken out of its context, such items may be used to convey messages contrary to the intended, possibly in conflict with European values or the policy of the institutions housing the collections.
Other risks may emerge from the (perceived) loss of control over the uses of the digital objects, possibly prompting cultural heritage institutions to limit the access to and the use of their digital assets, thus hampering the realisation of the wider societal value digitisation is expected to bring.
The uses of digitised cultural heritage, and the strategies that might be pursued in order to reap the full benefits while avoiding the pitfalls, have not been thoroughly researched. Proposals should address these gaps in knowledge, and elaborate evidence-based recommendations on how digitisation of cultural heritage can best be managed, as well as on how digitised cultural heritage can best be used.
The European cultural heritage sector is wide and diverse, comprised of many different actors, from large public institutions to independent artists and artisans. Moreover, the context, the cultural heritage itself and the policy landscape often vary strongly between different countries

32	See for instance https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cultural-heritage

and regions. This diversity should be taken into account when elaborating recommendations, so that these can realistically be applied across Europe.
To the extent possible, proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. Furthermore, where appropriate links should be established and synergies sought with related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. In particular, funded proposals should liaise with the projects funded under the ?European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? calls in the frame of Horizon Europe Cluster 2, as well as, to the extent appropriate, with projects funded under the Digital Europe programme to establish a European data space for cultural heritage",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-04, Cultural heritage in transformation ? facing change with confidence,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Deeper and broader understanding of the constantly changing nature of cultural heritage, and of how this understanding can be effectively shared with citizens.
?	Evidence based method(s), tested in small scale, that deploy a deeper understanding of the transformative nature of cultural heritage to help citizens face current and future societal transformations, change and disruption with greater confidence.
Scope: Cultural heritage has enormous potential in terms of its contribution to improving the quality of life for people, understanding the past and assisting territorial cohesion33. Cultural heritage gives us a sense of identity and belonging, and shape our future. Current policy discourses focus essentially on the need to protect and preserve cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations34.
However, just as culture and society, cultural heritage is in reality subject to constant change. Cultural heritage, ranging from the tangible to the intangible, from narratives and practices to monuments, landscapes and objects, is created, developed, destroyed, re-interpreted and re-

33	See for example Cultural Heritage in a Changing World (Borowiecki, Forbes, Fresa 2016)
34	See for instance the preamble to the World Heritage Convention (UNESCO 1972)

valued relentlessly. Moreover, how we interpret, value (or not) and manage our cultural heritage is, necessarily, a function of our currently dominating beliefs, values and other cultural and socio-economic circumstances. In effect, the now dominating discourse emphasising the need to protect and preserve a cultural heritage which is perceived as precious and fragile is a relatively recent phenomenon.
European citizens and societies are facing an ever faster pace of cultural, social and technological change, where old habits and beliefs are forcefully replaced by new ones. Every age in the course of history has experienced change to a greater or lesser extent, but it hardly seems an exaggeration to suggest that the world in the 21st century faces epochal changes, which affect every part of society. Subjected to such a dramatically changing environment, it is natural that citizens feel uncomfortable, perhaps lost, and long for the perceived stability of the past.
Making the constantly changing nature of our cultural heritage, the ongoing creation, destruction and re-interpretation, a more prominent and visible feature in the interaction with users, can potentially help make sense of today?s and tomorrow?s societal transformations. A greater understanding and broader awareness of the transformative nature of our cultural heritage can help put societal changes in perspective, diminish the stress perceived by people affected, and help approaching change with more confidence and less fear. Yet, the transformative nature of cultural heritage and the potential societal benefits it can bring has not been thoroughly researched.
The challenge is to deepen knowledge in this area, and devise ways to broaden and deepen the understanding of the transformative nature of cultural heritage, with the aim to help citizens face current and future societal transformations with greater confidence. The approach(es) chosen should be evidence based, effective and economically, culturally, politically and environmentally sustainable.
In order to verify and refine the effectiveness and sustainability of the proposed method(s) across Europe, at least three small scale pilot trials should be carried out in different settings.
Proposals may choose to focus broadly on a wide spectrum of cultural heritage or only on a highly relevant and potentially high-impact subset. However, the recommended methods should be effective across the cultural, geographic, political and socio-economic diversity of Europe.
To the extent possible, proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. Furthermore, funded proposals may establish links and seek synergies with related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020.",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-05, Fostering socio-economic development and job creation in rural and remote areas through cultural tourism,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Increase the macro-regional cultural tourism cooperation to help the socioeconomic development of rural and remote areas35.
?	Develop cultural tourism36 and creative tourism37 business models for rural and remote areas to increase sustainable job opportunities and investments.
?	Promote an inclusive and sustainable cultural and creative tourism that fosters social inclusion and engagement, respects the needs of local communities, the heritage and the capacity of the rural and remote areas.
Scope: A large part of European cultural landscapes outside urban territories is rural. Cultural and creative tourism, as a driver of sustainable development, could give visibility to those rural cultural landscapes and have a significant positive impact on the revitalisation of rural and remote areas. It could bring benefits to local communities, foster sustainable development, job creation and social inclusion, by promoting the indigenous cultural history and culture (with its traditions, arts and crafts) as well as the local gastronomy and farming.
However, increasing cultural and creative tourism in rural and remote areas might not be an easy task, as it requires specific and different policy solutions to address the challenges and specificities of the diversified rural and remote areas. Neighbourhood countries encounter similar challenges and specific problems, which the current one-size-fits-all cultural tourism business models cannot address. In addition, the geographical and cultural similarities within each macro-region provide the basis for cooperation and joint strategies, which could help to profile each region as a cultural tourism destination for key markets, but their full innovation potential is not yet fully exploited.



35	Typology	of	the	rural	and	remote	territories	is	given	on	LTVRA: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/strategy/strategy_documents/documents/ltvra-c2021-345- documents-part1_en.pdf
36	According to the definition adopted by the UNWTO General Assembly, at its 22nd session (2017), Cultural Tourism implies ?A type of tourism activity in which the visitor's essential motivation is to learn, discover, experience and consume the tangible and intangible cultural attractions/products in a tourism destination.
37	UNESCO (2006) also identifies creative tourism as ?travel directed toward an engaged and authentic experience, with participative learning in the arts, heritage, or special character of a place, and it provides a connection with those who reside in this place and create this living culture? (UNESCO, 2006:3).

Therefore, research and innovative solutions for sustainable cultural and creative tourism development in rural and remote areas (including outermost areas) that will aim at job creation and socio-economic regeneration, taking into consideration the specificities of each region and the diversity of economies should be explored by the research proposals under this topic.
Research should first explore and analyse how cultural tourism can benefit rural and remote areas as well as should address the challenges and needs of cultural tourism in these areas. Considering that cross-border cooperation might help rural and remote areas to promote the region as an attractive destination, the research should identify existing cross-border and macro- regional strategies for cultural tourism and analyse the level of cooperation of the EU neighbourhood countries and the countries of the same region. The researchers should examine whether the implementation of the existing practices contribute to or burden the balanced development of cultural tourism in rural and remote regions, as well as identify the barriers in their implementation. The proposals are expected to provide recommendations with methodologies, and good practices for improvements and develop cross-border/macro-regional sustainable cultural tourism policy scenarios for rural and remote areas that will aim to connect the more touristic with less touristic and remote destinations and to foster a balanced level of socioeconomic development. Solutions that would include the use of digital technologies to promote less touristic and remote destinations are welcome. The proposals should guarantee an equilibrium between the increase of cultural tourism and the capacity of the sites and the rural areas.
Cultural and creative tourism business models that will act as catalysts for the cooperation between the rural/remote areas of each region should be developed. Such models should aim at creating new job opportunities, fostering participation of local citizens in cultural tourism and increasing social inclusion, while promoting not only the natural and historical heritage but also the local identity, arts and crafts by engaging tourists with the creative process. The cultural and creative tourism business models and the processes of settlement development that the models might include should consider the protection of nature and built heritage of the rural and remote areas.
The proposals should also analyse how these business models can be applied to the cultural tourism for rural and remote areas to fully utilise their potential. The proposals may also consider promoting silver economy and silver tourism, through the proposed cultural and creative business models. Finally, the topic should contribute to the EU long-term Rural Vision",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-06, A world leading European video game innovation system,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,3.00 to 4.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Well founded and prioritised recommendations for European policy, including R&I policy, to support sustained innovation and growth in the European video game industry.
?	Methodology(ies), supported by evidence, to increment the use of video game know-how and technology to drive innovation in other economic sectors.
?	Significant contributions towards a thriving European video game industry that contributes decisively to economic growth, job creation, physical and mental well-being as well as to social and cultural cohesion.
Scope: The video game industry has shown exceptional growth and a fast paced evolution since its inception in the 1970?s. In 2019, the size of the European Union video game market was over 20b?38, a growth of 55% compared to 2014. 51% of the Union?s population played video games in 2019. Most forecasts predict continued rapid growth both in usage, turnover and added value for the foreseeable future.
The video game industry is in many ways a pioneer when it comes to harnessing the digital transition to create attractive products and rewarding experiences for its users. Also, the video game industry drives the development of new methods and technologies which have proven valuable in other industries, such as the automotive and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in the public sector.
Thus, the video game industry is not only a key channel of increasing importance for the expression of culture and creativity in Europe, but also a major economic sector in itself, and a vital driver of innovation in other economic sectors. Yet, the potential contributions to European economic growth, well-being, sustainability and social cohesion, and how to mobilise this potential, has not been thoroughly researched.
Research should address these gaps in knowledge, and develop recommendations for how to support sustained innovation, growth and competitiveness in the European video games sector, as well as for how to encourage the uptake of know-how and new technologies in other economic sectors.
The European cultural heritage and arts are diverse and uniquely renowned, and the European creative tradition strong. Such factors can constitute an important source of competitiveness for the sector.
Parts of Europe are often considered examples of success in the video game industry, such as Sweden, France or Finland, where some leading companies are headquartered and where the


38	?Key Facts? (2020), by ISFE

sector produce sizeable contributions to GDP and export revenues. Other parts of Europe, however, punch below their weight. Proposals should therefore involve different Member States/Associated Countries, in order to develop recommendations that are valid on a European scale.
The value chain ? or ecosystem ? of the video game industry is complex, diverse and rapidly evolving, as is generally the case in creative industries. Key roles are played by established companies with well-known brands, small independent development companies and freelancers, as well as by distribution platforms of various kinds.
Proposals do not have to cover the entire ecosystem in all its complexity, but may chose a more limited focus to allow a stronger impact. Research should, however, properly take into account all parts of the ecosystem which are key in accordance with the chosen focus and scope. Proposals should therefore provide for engagement with a wide set of stakeholders, including relevant policymakers, to ensure that solutions/methodologies developed are effective and economically, culturally and politically feasible at a European level.
Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, notably the ones funded by the European Union. Furthermore, funded proposals should establish links and seek synergies with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-01-07, Promoting cultural literacy through arts education to foster social inclusion,3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Increase understanding of the value of cultural literacy on social cohesion and the increase of tolerance on cultural diversity.
?	Provide innovative policy solutions that will increase cultural literacy in Europe through formal and non-formal education, as well as ways to integrate them into the education policies.
?	Foster cultural literacy around European cultures.

Scope: Cultural literacy may help individuals encounter cultural differences and to elaborate one?s own identity in a respectful social interaction with other people. Cultural literacy is necessary in the current European landscape, which has been intensified due to the various socioeconomic challenges, including misinformation, demographic change and migration, increasing the plurality of cultures and identities. Existing research has examined the importance of cultural literacy, its value in formal and non-formal education, while has examined ways to improve cultural literacy in Europe. However, the challenge is to better understand the value of cultural literacy on social cohesion and inclusion, how we could exploit its benefits through arts in education and what are the best practices/ policies to further integrate it in school and out of school activities. Education and education policies are a key to increasing resilience and cohesion in Europe, however, cultural literacy in education differs among the European countries, while the current policies in Europe commonly have a narrow and normative notion on how to implement this in practice.
Research proposals should first analyse the role of arts in the different stages of education (primary, secondary and/or higher education), including in non-formal education (especially in cases when non-formal education methods are integrated in formal education curricula) as well as how arts education can enhance/promote cultural literacy, aiming to develop prosperous, inclusive, and sustainable societies.
The research under this topic should examine the value/impact of cultural literacy on social cohesion and cultural diversity, and analyse how it can assist on the inclusion of disadvantaged groups and minorities into the cultural and social life. This analysis should include an indicative/representative examination of educational systems where cultural literacy education is well integrated as well as systems where it is less integrated or even absent (vis a vis indicators on multicultural competence).
The research proposals should examine the implementation/development of cultural literacy in Europe in the different stages of education including in non-formal education (taking also into consideration digital experiences) and identify the main barriers and needs for the integration of cultural literacy in education policies. Using the results of previous funded projects under H2020, the proposals should also analyse existing proposed solutions for the inclusion of cultural literacy in formal and informal forms of education and provide recommendations for effective actions for increased access of children and young people on cultural literacy. Proposals should take into consideration digital solutions, such as the interactive digital arts and ludic literacy. Proposals should include a lifelong learning perspective (early childhood education and care, school, vocational education and training and higher education, non-formal learning), and include national, regional and local support for partnerships (for example between schools and arts and cultural heritage organisations), while may consider the role of CCIs.
Europe needs policies and practices that seek to advance social cohesion and inclusion in a way that reflects the increasingly diverse reality of today?s Europe, supports respect for diversity and difference, and enables the growth of young people?s identities. Therefore, the proposals under this topic should develop innovative policy solutions/recommendations to increase

cultural literacy to positively affect society and provide ways that those solutions could be integrated into the education policies in Europe. The proposals should also propose methods that will help countries better assessing the impacts of cultural literacy on the inclusion of all children and young people.
The participation of countries with diverse educational policies is encouraged.",

?	A coordination network between organisations from the cultural and creative industries (CCIs), civil society, technological enterprises, secondary and higher education institutions and digital citizen platforms to foster the uptake of artistic, cultural and social science approaches in STEM education, research and innovation.

?	Increased understanding about the benefits of integrating artistic, cultural and social science approaches in STEM education, research and innovation and its impact on competitiveness, gender equality and career perspectives.
?	Pilot for the first European Union ?STE(A)M week for future women innovators? together with science and technology museums, technological enterprises, secondary and higher education institutions, CCIs and relevant civil society organisations, engaging at least 4000 students in STEM educational activities through cultural and creative approaches.
?	STEAM skills development and increased interest in new technologies, including those applied to cultural value chains and cultural heritage, to bridge the gender gap.
Scope: Women have long played an important, but often unacknowledged role in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and while the demand for STEM-skills in the labour market is growing to meet the green and digital transitions, women risk losing out on these opportunities due to their underrepresentation in these fields 40. Similarly, whilst women are overall well represented in many cultural professions, certain cultural and creative sectors which demand more digital and technological skills, such as the gaming and filming industry, still see a stark underrepresentation of women in these fields, as well as persisting gender stereotypes in the content that is produced.
In order to improve girls? participation and interest in these fields from an early age, a STEAM approach, featuring creative thinking, and a scientific evidence-based approach, applied arts (the ?A? in STEAM), and the teaching of science in political, environmental, socio-cultural contexts, can prove particularly useful. By highlighting the social impact and market relevance of research and innovation, the interdisciplinary STEAM approach can strengthen the appeal of scientific and technological careers, and make new products, including from the CCIs, more gender-sensitive.
The action should establish a coordination network between the CCIs, technological enterprises, SMEs, secondary and higher education institutions, and other relevant organisations, including digital citizen platforms to develop a better understanding of the potential benefits of cultural and artistic approaches in traditional STEM education, research and innovation. This includes examining the effects of such approaches on competitiveness, gender equality, and talent recruitment and retention in STEM-driven innovation, including in CCIs, where women are underrepresented. The network should provide mutual learning opportunities and develop evidence-based recommendations for policymakers and relevant organisations, wishing to adopt a STEAM approach. It should also offer girls and young women evidence-based training on the aspects that hinder the presence and promotion of women in STE(A)M, including stereotypes and doubles standards, gender-based violence (including sexual harassment), as well as successful strategies in preventing and overcoming these occurrences.


40	According to She Figures 2021, women are still underrepresented as doctoral graduates in STEM fields, including physical sciences (38%), ICT (20.8%), engineering (27%), and mathematics (32.5%).

In addition, in line with the European Strategy for Universities and the Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027, the coordination network should engage female students in learner-driven experiences in cultural and creative sectors, such as the gaming, filming and music industry, to strengthen their digital skills and broaden their interest in STEM-related skills.
The network should develop a pilot for an ?EU STEAM week for future women innovators?, together with science and technology museums, secondary and higher education institutions, relevant organisations from civil society, digital citizen platforms and the cultural and creative industries. Activities during this week should focus on exploring and learning about science history, STEAM related skills, and new technologies, like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, through interdisciplinary and creative approaches. The week should engage at least 4000 students aged 11-18 across EU Member States and Associated Countries. Activities should be open to all genders and the participation of girls from minority, socially disadvantaged and rural backgrounds is particularly encouraged.
Proposals should develop strategies for reproducibility and sustainability of the activities towards new skills? learning pathways, including through the creation of networks for the participants and follow-up training courses (e.g. summer schools, mentoring, and intersectoral exchange programs).
Activities may build on outcomes of relevant projects, funded under earlier Framework Programmes (e.g. Equals-EU, shemakes.eu, HYPATIA and Scientix 4) 41, results funded under the call HORIZON-CL2-2021-HERITAGE-01-03 and HORIZON-CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-

Scope: This topic aims at designing and establishing a European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) and demonstrating its basic capacities.
The cultural heritage sector is in the middle of a digital transition: digital technologies are revolutionising existing workflows, procedures and practices. To support this transition and further enhance research and innovation collaboration and activities in the field, the action should extend and improve the availability of sophisticated digital instruments and provide a platform for data exchange and collaboration to the cultural heritage sector. It should fulfil the

requirements of the practitioners in the field by being inclusive, collaborative, interactive, safe, fidelity- and equality-based, and providing open access.
The overall goal is to define, extend and accelerate the development of a platform for multidisciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration on cultural heritage, focusing on users? requirements and ease of use, as well as underpinning an open digital ecosystem that provides the tools and services needed to enable and scale-up future research and innovation in the field.
The initial focus is on the design and implementation of the basic architecture and governance of the ECCCH. The design and implementation of the ECCCH should be driven by the needs of its users: The professionals with various disciplinary background working on cultural heritage and in related sectors. The governance body of the effort therefore should include a wide representation from the European cultural heritage sector, research organisations, other related initiatives and from Member States and Associated Countries (see further below).
The project should:

?	Provide services to both large and small museums and other cultural heritage institutions, thereby bridging the gap between national, regional and local cultural heritage institutions, both public and private.
?	Establish a pan-European network of key stakeholders from cultural heritage institutions, including a robust scientific and professional community and be open to the cooperative efforts of a wide community of users.
?	Supervise and steer the overall development strategy for the ECCCH. This includes the collaborative production, enrichment, structuring and dissemination of shared data to support community needs, while at the same time establish clear rules for access and participation and set up a framework for connecting existing communities and initiatives related to research and digital innovation in cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.
?	Provide a unified framework for long-term access and preservation of digital(ised) data, both public and private, based on a user-driven and scalable design as well as a general strategy for stimulating the use of innovative tools and services for the ECCCH.
?	Propose a convincing consortium structure and outline a business plan ensuring viability during and after the implementation of the grant.
?	Ensure continued maintenance of the ECCCH platform and the required storage, beyond the lifetime of the project and position the digital ecosystem as a key to connecting cultural heritage actors, activities and objects in synergy with the other related initiatives in the field.

?	Enable semantic representation of multiple data types (various incarnations of 2D and 3D media, video, text), stored in federated repositories according to FAIR principles57and encoding data provenance. Previous and current ongoing related European initiatives should be properly taken into account. If appropriate, collaboration with the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space) should be established.
?	Allow for efficient web-based visualisation and analysis, and the creation of annotations over visual data.
Controlled use of data is an important goal. Thus, the ECCCH should support authentication (single user/groups of users), identification of ownership, data rights and traceability of modifications (creation of derived data), data quality/fidelity information, and data security facilities. Technologies enabling access and use from geographic areas with low-performance network connections should be provided. The system should allow national communities/institutions to link and potentially configure their own local clouds, in case this is necessary.
The project should build an inventory of previously funded EU and national initiatives and existing digital resources in areas relevant to the ECCCH, such as for instance EOSC, the Data Space, Europeana or Gaia-X, establish a comprehensive gap analysis and identify the outputs or resources that could be incorporated in, connected to or facilitate interoperability with the ECCCH, with a view to build on previous investments and already available initiatives.
The proposed open source platform should:

?	Build on and expand existing standards and consolidated practices for managing the relevant data, including resources such as ontologies, vocabularies and terminologies. If appropriate, this work should be conducted in collaboration with the Data Space;
?	Be based on a modular, extensible and evolutionary model, that enables the incorporation of other instruments/tools developed by other subsequent consortia (thus providing libraries and Application Programming Interface (API) for designing tools, including HTML5- and WebGL-compliant Graphical User Interface (GUI) and data visualisation libraries);
?	Provide instruments for assessing the quality of the data on the platform (and related attributes in the data model), and for monitoring the effectiveness/usage of the tools integrated into the ECCCH;
?	Along with basic data management layers, the ECCCH should provide the necessary instruments for developing applications working on and integrating with the cloud. These instruments and related libraries should be properly documented by means of software development guidelines, allowing other consortia to design additional tools to extend the ECCCH.


57	Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable

Demonstrating successfully a selection of essential tools enabling collaborative research and innovation activities of users within the ECCCH that can also serve as good-practice examples for the development of additional professional tools needed for the sustainable functioning of the platform, e.g.:
?	Integrating and accessing data, providing interactive and batch functionalities for data and metadata stored on the (federated) semantic repository, as well as sophisticated search and retrieval features, with web-based browsers specific for each data type, with compatible GUI;
?	Data management, to structure, encode, store and analyse all knowledge needed to support curation activities (organisation of catalogues, bibliographies, conservation history of specific artworks, loan and travel history, monitor fraudulent use of museum?s digital assets, etc.).
All basic infrastructure components should be provided as open-source, with proper documentation and training material to enable other consortia to cooperatively contribute data and tools to the cloud platform, according to the principle of an extensible and evolutionary design of the cloud. The good practice proposed for software documentation should become a reference for other project consortia under topics promoted in future ECCCH calls.
The ECCCH governance should follow basic requirements. In concrete terms, it should be structured and defined around the following needs: data security, scalability, technical robustness, technical and economic sustainability, independent usability evaluation and long- term assessments, networking, training and community building.58 To this end, the governance should include a legal entity with a Single Entry Point (SEP), as well as an independent external advisory board. The governance should be properly documented.
The governance body should include representative stakeholders of existing communities and cultural heritage institutions, potentially involving coordinators of other actions funded under the ECCCH calls and, if appropriate, relevant actions funded under the Digital Europe Programme, such as the Data Space. Furthermore, the governance body should ensure the engagement of appropriate representatives of a wide range of Member States and Associated Countries, as well as of related EU initiatives.
The governance body should:

?	drive continuous evaluation processes (integration and interoperability aspects, verification of user interface consistency and usability, and evaluation of effectiveness). These evaluations need to be conducted independently of the funded consortium;





58	See European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv”nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex ? ante impact assessment, 2022, Executive summary, p. 5, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014

?	connect technical consortia with the cultural heritage community at large, as well as with an inclusive community of professionals and researchers, through networking and training programs;
?	capture community expectations and oversee user-based assessments of ECCCH resources;
?	contribute to the future development agenda of the ECCCH and ensure economic, organisational and technical long-term sustainability.
?	ensure sustainability after the implementation of the grant.
The proposal should set out active links and coordination with projects funded under the call HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, and if appropriate also with relevant projects funded under the Digital Europe programme, to take part in common technical coordination activities, and with a view to ensure synergies with current and previous activities in the field. It is expected to provide clear guidelines and technical support on how the deliverables developed by subsequent projects should be designed and implemented, with the goal of ensuring a proper integration in the ECCCH platform. Therefore, the proposal is expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The Commission may take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with additional relevant stakeholders, if appropriate.
The proposal should also set up and manage a common ECCCH website, where all projects funded under the ECCCH calls should be granted space. It is critical that any interested party from the EU or Associated Countries can access the ECCCH at fair conditions and pricing and with transparent and mutual obligations with regards to, for instance, security, safety and intellectual property rights. This should include the promotion of examples of collaborative work in representative application areas that relate to a large part of the cultural heritage sector.
Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties, in particular cultural heritage institutions with regional or local scope or mandate, in view of promoting the take-up of tools and methodologies as well as for demonstrating and validating the relevant use cases through experiments. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. A maximum of 10% of the budget is expected to be dedicated to financial support to third parties.
The Commission estimates that a project duration of approximately 5 years is appropriate for the project funded under this topic, in order to ensure that results from future ECCCH actions can be properly incorporated",
HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-02, A European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage ? Innovative tools for digitising cultural heritage objects,9/21/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,4.00 to 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Cultural heritage professionals in Europe, including curators, conservators and researchers of cultural heritage, use a common set of new innovative tools and methods for the digitisation and visualisation of cultural heritage objects (3D and enhanced 2D) with regard to their visible and non-visible properties and characteristics, which are accessible through and connected to the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).
?	The European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) provides cultural heritage institutions and professionals with enhanced technological and methodological capabilities to study cultural heritage objects, to share related data of their visible and non- visible properties and characteristics, and to develop new forms of collaboration.
Scope: This topic aims at designing and implementing innovative tools and methods for digitisation of (a) visible characteristics and (b) non-visible characteristics of cultural heritage objects, to be incorporated into the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH).
As regards digitisation of visible characteristics of cultural heritage objects, technologies are now satisfying the needs for a considerable part of uses and objects. For instance, in the field of digital documentation of cultural heritage, three-dimensional acquisition and reconstruction methods have been developed in the past twenty years, using photogrammetry and laser scanning techniques to capture the characteristics of physical cultural heritage objects. Such methods already provide robust solutions for the digital reconstruction of the geometry and visual appearance of object surfaces. In addition to these methods, in the field of cultural heritage conservation various non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have become important technical and scientific means of examination. Such techniques allow understanding the phenomena of deterioration and defining the restoration, conservation and documentation needs of cultural heritage objects.
Nevertheless, there are still major needs in cultural heritage that require further research and innovation on more advanced digitisation tools and methods:
?	New AI-powered tools and methods that improve the digitisation process of tangible cultural heritage objects. The robustness and efficiency of the 3D digitisation process should be improved, especially in the case of massive digitisation (for example collections of objects). The accuracy and completeness of surface appearance acquisition should also be improved, as well as the mapping of complex reflectance data on digital surfaces. Furthermore, such solutions should yield new improved methods for post-processing and cleaning of the 3D models produced.
?	Improved methods for acquiring and processing enhanced 2D representations (e.g. reflectance transformation imaging, multispectral, panoramic), and for better integrating 2D representations with 3D representations.

?	Future 3D models need to encode other key attributes in addition to the usual geometric and reflectance data, such as local uncertainty information. New tools and methods are therefore needed to calculate and encode local accuracy limits with high precision in reconstructed 3D models. These tools should be capable of producing measurement-based limits of the similarity between the digital model and the physical object at any surface point, as well as algorithmically estimated accuracy boundaries.
?	To model a complex assembly is a costly effort, and today often requires dismounting the assembly - which is often not possible. Specific digitisation solutions should be developed that are capable of mixing various digitisation approaches (e.g. scanning and computer tomography scans) in order to capture dynamic or hidden characteristics of complex assemblies without dismounting them.62
As regards the study of non-visible characteristics of complex objects, nowadays different techniques are used, e.g. multispectral imaging, X-rays, infrared reflectance, terahertz imaging, etc. Proposals should focus on innovations at the data acquisition level, with a view to improve the quality and usability of the data generated. An important aspect is the robustness, reliability as well as the ease of use of any tool and method for analysing the visible characteristics and non-visible materials properties of cultural heritage objects under real world conditions. In addition, several recent experimental approaches have shown that multimodal analysis techniques should include a temporal dimension, observing the evolution of features and phenomena over time.
These challenges highlight the need for flexible, transferable, and simple solutions for documenting multimodal analyses. These solutions should include the integration of data acquisitions from different technologies into complex data structures that provide new analysis opportunities for conservation scientists, conservators and curators. This requires the introduction of new visualisation tools that act as virtual environments for scientific exploration, allowing scientists and curators to explore the full material complexity of cultural heritage objects beyond what is visible.
Large datasets are often generated (e.g., many dozens of images in the case of hyperspectral imaging). To address this, new AI solutions should be developed to generate classified or pre- analysed data, enabling the selection and/or identification of specific elements, images or regions of interest that exhibit important differences for subsequent analysis and validation by the human expert.
The tools and methods introduced should focus on geometric and projective consistency of heterogeneous data from different technologies, with respect to different scales of observation and analysis, over a wide spectral range, to produce an integrated digital representation. Spatially localised characterisation of individual material layers is one of the goals, including coupling multi- or hyperspectral analyses with physicochemical characterisation of materials.

62	Concerning digitisation tools and methods mentioned, see European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv”nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex ? ante impact assessment, 2022, pp. 38-42 and 61-62, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014

New methods for access, exploration, and temporal monitoring of acquired data should be developed, including their interactive visualisation and classification.
The proposed software tools and methods to be developed should go beyond the lab prototype status, should be practical and possible to deploy easily in un-controlled environments (e.g. digitise in a museum room), and should ensure low cost and flexibility of use. The component for data integration into the ECCCH may extend the features of the basic tool developed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01, with the goal of streamlining the upload of metadata/paradata and of raw sampled data.
The proposals should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and conservation/restoration issues. The results of these case studies should produce emblematic data that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tool(s) and methods in other contexts and by other users within the ECCCH.
The proposed tool(s) to be developed should be implemented adopting the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-
01.	The tool(s) developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic ?HORIZON- CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01?.
The proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of ECCCH initiative. In particular, the proposals should coordinate technical work with other selected projects and contribute to the activities of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.
The proposals should set up its project website under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The proposal is further expected to include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings and may consider to cover the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage",

?	Wider involvement and social inclusion of citizens in the preservation and enhancement of cultural heritage through engagement with local ecosystems.
Scope: The New European Bauhaus, as closely connected to cultural heritage and culture, brings a cultural and creative dimension to the European Green Deal. The September 2021 Communication on the New European Bauhaus, recognises that artists and cultural and creative professionals are essential actors when it comes to reflecting and conveying values, to transmitting new and symbolic meanings, and to ensuring sustainability and enabling societal transformation.
Proposals should test and refine innovative solutions to achieve strategic investments in cultural heritage and the CCIs in the spirit of the New European Bauhaus initiative and search for links with the ESFRI Research Infrastructures in the Social and Cultural Innovation.67. They are expected to bring together researchers, practitioners, managers and entrepreneurs from different cultural and creative industries (e.g. design, fashion, crafts, arts and heritage professionals at large) as well as to engage with the on-the-ground communities. At least 5 small scale-trials under real world conditions should be carried out in a minimum of 3 different Member States/Associated Countries.
Proposals should tackle at least one of the thematic axes of the New European Bauhaus.

?	Proposals should include an ambitious and credible executive plan that: Identifies and analyses the challenges and resources of the targeted spaces in terms of the three core values of the New European Bauhaus.
?	Propose a set of strategies and methodologies to address the challenges identified, considering the wide variety of actors involved.
?	Foresee the development and implementation of an ambitious, quality co-design process, based on citizens' and stakeholders' participation, inter-disciplinary, and multi-level collaboration.
They should highlight the social value of cultural heritage and cultural diversity. The proposed solutions should consider:
?	Use of renewable materials (e.g. nature-based materials produced sustainably) with a circular economy mind-set
?	Role of arts, design and quality architecture, in line with quality principles68 to leverage the full potential of cultural heritage and cultural landscapes

?	Refined and validated approach(es) for Europe?s cultural and creative industries (CCIs)73 to become true drivers of a sustainable climate transition.


?	Significant contributions to help European CCIs become better prepared to adapt to and contribute to the climate transition in line with the 2030 goals spelled out under a European Green Deal74.
Scope: The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) are an important source of growth and job creation in the European economy. Moreover, the CCIs play a key role in shaping culture, values and perceptions across the European Union and beyond. Thus, the role of the CCIs in achieving the European Union?s climate transition objectives is crucial.
At the same time, the CCIs are characterised by a large and diverse number of chiefly small and micro enterprises, as well as by hefty differences across geographical and sectorial divides. Large parts of the CCIs, thus, lack the capacity to take the necessary measures to adapt to and thrive under the climate transition, not to speak of driving this transition.
Specific approaches are therefore needed to enable Europe?s CCIs to develop their full potential to support a sustainable climate transition.
Such approaches need to address the adoption of new sustainable business models, including the use of new technologies, production methods and possibly the development or adaption of new technological solutions, as well as gaps in skills and capacities. They should be valid across different Member States/Associated Countries, and address the needs of small, micro as well as larger companies. Such approaches may involve the use of platforms or networks to facilitate sharing investments, facilities or competencies among several companies or across sectors.
Proposals should provide for testing and refining such model(s) through small scale pilot trials under real world conditions. These pilot trials should verify the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the action(s), as well as the efficacy.
Proposals should choose a suitable set of CCI sector(s), or/and cross-sectoral issues, to focus on, which allow significant impacts to be achieved. Results should be valid at a European level, therefore the pilot trials need to involve at least five Member States/Associated Countries, as

?	Validated and refined measures to increase the use of innovative digital technologies by Europe?s cultural and creative industries (CCIs) 76 , with a view to increased competitiveness and sustainability77.

?	Significant contributions to strengthen the ability of European CCIs to contribute to a human-centred digital transition.
Scope: The cultural and creative industries (CCIs) are an important source of growth and job creation in the European economy. Moreover, the CCIs play a key role in shaping culture, values and perceptions across the European Union and beyond.
At the same time, the CCIs are characterised by a large and diverse number of chiefly small and micro enterprises, as well as by hefty differences across geographical and sectorial divides.
The ongoing digital transition brings great opportunities for the CCIs, but also serious threats. The measures taken during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce contagion forced much human interaction into the digital realm, to a degree illustrating possible consequences of the digital transition. Large parts of the European CCIs were devastated78.
To take full advantage of the many opportunities offered by the digital transition, and avoid the pitfalls, require capacities and competencies that many of Europe?s CCIs currently lack.
Proposals should provide for devising effective and cost efficient measures to support CCIs to embrace and make full use of digital technologies for competitiveness and sustainability.
Proposals should chose a suitable set of CCI sector(s), or/and cross-sectoral issues, to focus on, which allow significant impacts to be achieved. A wide array of digital technologies should be considered, which are deemed crucial to the CCI sector(s) or/and issues chosen. Analytical technologies such as ?big data? or ?artificial intelligence? could be used for instance to better understand users? behaviours, to better plan activities or/and to engage deeper with customers. Visualisation and multi-sensorial technologies such as ?virtual reality?, ?augmented reality? or ?extended reality? could be employed to create more attractive products and services.
The proposed support measures should be effective and efficient across different Member States/Associated Countries, and address the needs of small, micro as well as larger companies. Such measures may involve the use of platforms or networks to facilitate sharing investments, facilities or competencies among several companies or across sectors.

?	Further increase the visibility of and access to European arts and culture internationally.



79	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf

?	Develop and test pilot solutions based on a model that will allow cooperation between local, national and European level and establish strategic alliances between art and cultural sectors and with other sectors.
?	Assess the effectiveness of good practices, programmes and policies that promote the EU priorities, culture and fundamental values abroad.
?	Strengthen the CCIs presence worldwide by promoting the European arts internationally.
Scope: The European Union should endeavour to use its cultural and creative assets to better assert its influence around the world. The arts can play an important role on building the contemporary image of the EU by increasing the visibility of the European identity, cultural heritage and the promotion of its values. In addition to the cultural benefits, the increased visibility of European arts and culture abroad can foster a sustainable and inclusive local, regional and national development and growth, while influence countries outside the EU on important societal issues, such as the protection of the environment, peace and security, migration, gender equality, justice, or freedom of expression.
However, when it comes to the presentation of the European traditional arts and culture abroad there is still lack of cooperation between national and European level. Even though there is a lot of funded research on the benefits of the European arts and culture and the ways to increase their visibility, the EU does not yet have an aligned vision and approach on how to promote the European values and identities through arts and meet common goals on behalf of the EU.
The objective of this innovation proposal is to test existing practices and policies that allow arts and culture to promote European values and identities outside Europe, to identify potential existing barriers and propose a mixed model for cooperation that will take into account participation at the local, national and regional level and the coordination of different sectors and stakeholders. In this analysis, the presence of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs) should be considered.
Building on existing evidence, including from projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL2- 2022-HERITAGE-01-02, proposals should identify creative practices, policies and programmes that aim to increase the attractiveness of the European arts (including digital arts) and culture abroad. They should collect good innovative practices developed at the EU and national level and develop small-scale pilots that will test their efficiency. Proposals should identify and analyse the barriers, shortcomings and needs of the existing policies and practicities and propose policy recommendations for improvements.
In this context, the proposals should also analyse the extent to which the existing practices and policies encourage coordination among countries as well as coordination among bodies at regional and local levels as well as the role and support of the EU on the cooperation and harmonisation of the Member States? actions, as regards the of European arts? promotion abroad.
The proposals may also look after the potential impacts of new regulations on the arts sector, including the copyright Directive that was adopted in March of 2019, and evaluate their

effectiveness as regards their international access to European works of arts and performing arts.
The proposals should propose pilot policy solutions based on a mixed model that will allow cooperation at local, national and European level, better cooperation of the art sectors and the CCIs, while establish strategic alliances with other sectors.
The proposed mixed model should be developed and tested in wide and diversified partnerships of stakeholders. The proposals should develop policy recommendations for integrating this innovative mixed model into the arts policies",
HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-05, Strategies to strengthen the European linguistic capital in a globalised world,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Strategies for protection of the European linguistic capital at the era of the digital shift in economy, education and communication, which will include socially sustainable and economically affordable implementation measures and processes in the short and medium term.
?	A deeper understanding of the impact of digitalisation/language related technologies on the European linguistic capital, especially on the endangered languages and identity preservation of EU citizens.
?	Enhanced cooperation at the European level between experts on the subject and other relevant stakeholders including educational institutions.
?	Recommendations to inform multilingual policies on further measures to promote the learning and daily use of more than one language, while encouraging European youth to value and possibly undertake humanistic studies in particular in their native languages.
Scope: European languages are vehicles of our identity, behaviour & cultural perception. Communicating in their native languages, EU citizens connect with their cultural heritage, build their collective and individual identity and better understand the contribution of their national or regional culture to the European culture as a whole. However, in the globalisation era, some languages are dominating, leading gradually to a ?language oligopoly?.

More than ever, so-called ?international languages? threaten less-spoken languages. The European language capital is at risk of impoverishment. The domination of digital technologies leads to changes in the way people exchange i.e. by disregarding languages? rules (syntax, semantics and orthography) and underestimating humanistic education. Protecting Europe?s linguistic capital is essential to avoid cultural dilution, to strengthen European identity, culture and creativity and to promote mutual understanding and social inclusion, which serve social, economic and political stability in Europe.
Therefore, research should address tensions between globalisation and the preservation of European identities as expressed by languages, paying attention to policies and practices regarding the use of national and ?international? languages and their place in each country?s cultural, scientific, academic, social, political and economic life. It should develop evidence- based strategies and policy recommendations to help policymakers and stakeholders protect endangered European languages in the context of the massive socio-cultural and economic changes of the present era. Proposals should inform EU multilingualism policy and provide national education (and other) policies with guidance to better link EU citizens with each other as well as with their own language and literature tradition, which are the main repository of the European culture and history. In times when democracy faces cumulative threats, it is particularly important that proposals advise on ways where all languages spoken in Europe can harmoniously coexist and benefit from equal treatment, including the use of language digital technologies. Links can also be made to the projects developed under the topic HORIZON- CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-10: Political participation in multilingual spaces.
Proposals should develop recommendations that empower citizens to utilise their own language at national, regional and EU level. These recommendations should aim at combating marginalisation of disadvantaged linguistic communities. In pursuing these recommendations, proposals could identify weaknesses of the multilingual policies in the EU (explicit and implicit) and share best practices from other multilingual countries across the globe. In their design, proposals are encouraged to involve young people from the very beginning with a view to grasping their views and perceptions as regards to multilingualism in the EU as well as the most suitable ways to protect their native languages",

?	Better understanding of the spatial implications of increased remote working and its challenges for different regions, including urban and rural areas.
?	Increased understanding on the impact of remote working arrangements on the living and working conditions, including health and safety at work, work-life balance and consequences of cross-border working.
?	Better understanding of the possible consequences to communal life and society.
?	Recommendations to help urban and rural areas to shape the trends of remote working cope with the challenges and seize the opportunities.
Scope: Remote working arrangements have considerably increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, giving a new perspective to a long ongoing debate on a solution which before was primarily an opportunity to improve employees? work-life balance.
This phenomenon has the potential to decentralise jobs away from metropolitan areas creating opportunities for both urban and rural areas, including for the less favoured regions. For urban areas, it has the potential to alleviate housing prices and air quality. On the other hand, it can, at the same, change the urban landscape, notably regarding the occupation of buildings and their usage in areas where enterprises may switch completely to remote work arrangements. For rural areas, it can create more dynamism and attract necessary investments, including for essential services such as health care and transport. Moreover, rural areas tend to concentrate key sectors for the green transition, such as agriculture and clean energy production, for which attracting skilled, remote workers could affect particular challenges faced by rural areas, such as an ageing population and skills shortage. Simultaneously, increased attractiveness can also have a negative impact for the local community, for instance due to housing price increase and create pressure over existing infrastructure, as well as accelerate agricultural land take.
Not all workers can enjoy the benefits of working from home: it is estimated that only approximately 37% of EU-27 workers are in occupations that can be carried out from home. This could aggravate existing spatial segregation and inequalities. Moreover, remote work can significantly change working conditions and affect the health and safety of workers. Finally, employees whose workplace is in a different country than the place of employment may face complications regarding social security and taxation.
Research should investigate how remote working arrangements can affect different spaces, focusing on the urban and rural divide and its impacts on the local communities, including on ethical and social aspects, employment, as well as on administration and infrastructures.
It should further research how remote working arrangements impact working conditions, notably health and safety of workers, the skills divide, working time, work-life balance and

broader social impacts, including family and care arrangements, as well as mental health and loneliness.
Research activities should also evaluate the consequences of remote working on already existing inequalities. They should forecast the development of the remote working trend and should identify populations benefitting and populations who run the risk of losing out.
As remote working is a phenomenon affecting societies on all levels, an outlook and policy recommendations should target policymakers on EU level as well as Member States?, Associated Countries? and regional/local authorities.
Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged. Finally, the topic should contribute to the EU Rural Vision",

Scope: Gross domestic product (GDP) is still the main macroeconomic indicator used around the world to quantify economic activity. However, the GDP indicator was never designed to measure human and planetary prosperity and well-being. Since more than a decade now85, it is becoming clear that GDP on its own cannot reflect the real level of well-being and development of a society, or the damage done to the environment by certain economic activities and consumption choices86. ?Beyond GDP? policy frameworks and indicators such as the Eurostat Sustainable Development Goals reporting87 are needed to measure progress against the global

challenges of the 21st century (such as climate change; demographic changes; changing world of work; digitalisation and technological change).
The transition to a well-being economy is embedded in the United Nation?s 2030 Agenda and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in the 8th EAP and enshrined in both the 2030 and 2050 priority objectives. Multidimensional ?beyond GDP? indicators and policy frameworks are needed to monitor and measure, inform policymaking, improve communication, and promote target setting on social, economic, and environmental objectives. Such indicators are crucial to measure well-being and prosperity as well as environmental and social sustainability at individual, community, national level and international level, while accounting for the principle of ""leaving no one behind"" and capturing spill over effects of the EU?s activities. Well-being indicators should be used to measure both objective and subjective dimensions, where the latter refers to individual behaviours, social preferences, values systems and social norms.
Over the past decade, several new well-being indicators have been developed, which have been embraced to various degrees by several governments and international organisations. At the current juncture, the challenge is twofold: 1) to overcome data gaps caused by lack of data collection and insufficient harmonisation and coordination across Member States, and 2) to bring ?beyond GDP? policy frameworks and well-being indicators into more active policymaking in a sensible and clearer way. Initiatives under this call should provide tangible solutions to this challenge.
The goal of the proposals should be to help in particular policy makers and stakeholders, who are not familiar with beyond GDP policy frameworks and well-being indicators, but want to learn how to better incorporate well-being considerations into their work. The proposals should design concrete co-creation tools that support policymakers at the national, regional, local and city levels to develop and analyse policies and programmes with a well-being lens.
To this end, the proposals should shed light on the synergies between existing data sources, initiatives on beyond GDP, and results from previous funded projects. Proposals could cover actions that provide support and methodological guidance to the EU and Member States, policymakers, national authorities, and experts on data collection and statistics to measure and monitor well-being, sustainability, and resilience. By working together with the relevant policy makers and National Statistical Offices projects could assess, for example, the feasibility of scaling up existing knowledge on well-being, sustainability and resilience metrics by integrating it into more regular and standardised data collection exercises.
The proposals may also work towards establishing a European network that would help bring existing beyond GDP policy frameworks and well-being indicators into more active policymaking. Such a network should include a broad range of stakeholders representing diverse backgrounds and needs from all EU Member States, including policymakers, academic experts, international organisations, relevant fora and National Statistical Offices or other national authorities in charge as well as social partners.

Outputs should, where possible, feed into online learning content accessible to the public and various stakeholders in the form of platforms and knowledge repositories, and thereby open doors for mutual learning opportunities and exchanges of good practices. The proposals are encouraged to build strong networks and liaise with other stakeholders working on well-being through regular exchanges, in the form of, for example, boards of experts, workshops and networking events",

?	Enhance EU migration governance by matching analyses of skills shortages in the EU and in non-EU countries.
?	Provide tools to decision makers to navigate skill shortages in EU labour markets.
?	Present an overview of the trade-offs of filling shortages with migrant workforce vis-…-vis other alternatives such as education/local - and re upskilling/automation.
Scope: As the EU?s workforce grows older, there is increasing political attention on how to recruit workers with the right skills for a changing labour market. The EU has proposed to develop ?Talent Partnerships?88 with third countries of origin, in order to train and recruit workers from outside of the EU. This type of international partnership based on skills, is premised on the idea that in many sectors shortages are global, and thereby one can develop training centres at lower cost outside of the EU, training people which may then spend their skills both in the origin countries, as well as in the EU. Research has started to look at this promising principle finding interesting practices89, yet attention is needed on a macro level to better understand causes and consequences of such shortages globally, in order to envisage scaling up such promising pilots and practices.
Firstly, research should focus on countries of destination, with a particular focus on the EU (at the national and regional level) in the context of an ageing population with a shrinking


88	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/FS_22_2656
89	https://www.migrationpartnershipfacility.eu/labour-mobility

workforce and tax base. Proposals should focus on the shortage model that leads to recruitment of foreign workers through skill partnerships, and should assess their existence and their cause, with particular attention on how to define and measure them. This should shed light on the need to expand workforce by recruiting foreign labour, also by assessing viability and trade-offs of other alternatives. These could be, but are not limited to: raising wages, also considering incentives needed employers to do so vis-…-vis foreign worker recruitment; education and upskilling of local workforce, considering the possibility of matching supply and demand of labour depending on the sector and timeframe of the needs; automation, with a focus to investments and incentives needed to reach a level of automation of work in sectors which rely on migrant workforce. As such, proposals should assess causes and consequences of shortages in destination countries warranting the establishment of partnerships with third countries to recruit needed skills.
Proposals should then focus on third countries of origin, and go beyond single case studies keeping a macro and/or cross-case comparison perspective. Proposals should develop a way to evaluate labour markets and analyse matching needs and shortages compared to the EU. Proposals could combine labour market analyses with a focus on the education system and analyse structures in place for training people for those sectors in need, including spending attention on qualifications obtained in view of EU recognition, as well as on language skills as a factor for migrant integration. Proposals should also analyse the relation between investing in upskilling local workforce in view of recruiting a proportion of this, together with the creation of local human capital that could act as a driver for local development. This could be coupled with a survey in different countries with skilled (migrant) workers, in view of developing a database of microdata on the interaction of developing skills with local development processes. Proposals could take into account mobility patterns and retention initiatives as part of their analysis, as well as the ESCO classification90. Overall, such analyses should shed light on conditions which influence positively or negatively local development processes vis-…-vis foreign upskilling and recruitment, analysing conditions which lead domestic institutions to capitalise on the positive effects. Proposals may also include a historical perspective with comparisons with ?guest worker? programs of recruitment of foreign workers in the second half of the 20th century, to build on what has worked and what has not in the past. Proposals are encouraged to consider in their analyses in particular the pilot projects on legal migration carried out by the Mobility Partnership Facility91, as well as other projects running in this area, inter alia the Flagship Technical Support topic92, the European Training Foundation?s ?Skills Lab?93, THAMM project in North-Africa94 and the MATCH project95.
As such, proposals should consider both sides of ?skill partnerships? including the issues of brain drain and economic development of third countries, and assess the shortage model on

?	Valorise existing research and maximise outputs produced by distilling useful information for policymakers.
?	Develop series of opportunities for mutual learning between policymakers, practitioners and the research community, based on research outputs and implemented through innovative methodologies and practices.
Scope: Proposals should build a rigorous method to bridge science to policy relations on migration, building from existing literature not exclusive to migration policy, including on decision-making, organisational studies, behavioural insights, human rights and public policy literature. It should therefore define a strategy towards informing policy making on migration through evidence, taking into careful consideration all elements of the policy cycle, including: institutions involved, networks of actors and stakeholders, frames, perceptions and narratives that shape the context in which decisions are taken, information available to decision makers, and finally the way in which policy choices are taken. This should also include consideration of cognition, values, human rights and biases and the role these play in distilling information available and deciding upon a course of action.
Having developed such a strategy specific to EU migration policymaking at its different levels (supranational, national, local), proposals should make a selection of migration research, and distil useful findings for policymakers. The specific topics on which to focus should be selected in synergy with practitioners and policymakers, identifying research consensus as well as knowledge gaps in the policy processes on which quick advice can be most useful. Proposals are encouraged to focus first on EU funded research and projects (funded through Horizon 2020/Europe, AMIF, ESFD+, EUTF, NDICI), but are also encouraged to look for further evidence available whenever necessary.
Finally proposals should apply the strategy for engaging with policymakers already from the beginning of their lifecycle to create opportunities for mutual learning between researchers and policymakers, on the topics identified in synergy with practitioners. This should not be limited to a normal dissemination strategy (policy briefs, presentations) aimed at feeding research into policy. It should also include innovative methodologies for exchange and learning, such as, but not limited to: case study analysis, scenario building, and other useful strategies that may help simulate how to manage disagreements and the intrinsic complexity of migration policy making. This should create a network that could for example include participants from EU institutions, Member States, International Organisations, partner Countries, NGOs and other stakeholders, with a view to be sustainable as a basis for exchange beyond the lifetime of the project. The proposals are strongly encouraged to seek ways to work in complementarity and coordination with existing migration networks at the EU level, notably the European Migration Network and the Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography",

?	Design, develop and use methodologies to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of specific policy measures or programmes in the field of education and training based on rigorous quantitative research methods, for example randomised controlled trials, natural experiments or other statistical techniques to perform causal evaluations.
?	Gather evidence to assess costs and benefits to compare the efficiency of policy measures or programmes.
?	Identify education and training policies ensuring an efficient use of public resources to improve learning outcomes, as well as measures of equity and inclusion of education and training systems.
?	Develop policy recommendations to inform policy measures, programmes, future evaluations and actions in the field of education and training.
Scope: Effective and efficient investment in education and training at all educational levels and for all age groups is a prerequisite for enhancing quality and inclusiveness of the education and training systems, improving the education outcomes, meeting the European Education Area objectives and targets, as well as for driving sustainable growth, improving well-being, and building a more inclusive society97. The Commission launched an Expert Group on Quality Investment in Education and Training98 focusing on teachers and trainers, digital education, education infrastructure and learning environments and equity and inclusion.
Investing effectively and efficiently in education and training has a potential to aid the recovery and contribute to the green and digital transitions of the education and training sector. However, most of the empirical evidence on the evaluation of education and training policies comes from the US or the UK. More analysis in EU Member States and Associated Countries is necessary to know if promising policies identified in the academic literature would be effective in a different local context. Moreover, a cost-benefit analysis of the policy measures evaluated is rarely available.

?	Map and collect existing regional or national longitudinal data allowing to follow individual cohorts of students over time and allowing to analyse their learning outcomes, and trends in educational inequalities.
?	Provide policymakers with an analysis of the available literature and a selection of techniques used to assess inequalities in education, training and learning achievements over time.
?	Identify the interventions that compensate inequalities in learning outcomes over time based on the analysis of longitudinal data.
Scope: Long-standing educational inequalities have been pervasive across the European Union and the disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have further aggravated inequalities within and between countries. Despite the richness of analysis, existing initiatives and recommendations, longitudinal studies of individual student cohorts are rare, and it is difficult to follow students, assess their learning outcomes over time and identify trends in education inequalities. It is even more difficult to examine any causal link between educational policies and inequalities in education achievements. Proposals should map and collect surveys with a longitudinal design, following the learning progress of students over time, and linking with information for example on students? achievement scores, socio-economic background, language spoken at home, migration history, the school they attend, or whether they have

attended early care and childhood education. Close cooperation with authorities and/or other institutions owning the data is essential and should be ensured.

?	Policymakers are provided with a set of data at European level on skills and labour shortages.
?	Citizens and policymakers can access to Europe wide sound indicators for skills and labour shortages, comparable across countries.
?	Provide policymakers with viable pathways to reduce skills shortages and mismatch.
Scope: Well-functioning and balanced skills and labour market are a precondition for an inclusive society, low unemployment and inequalities, and a thriving economy.
Globalisation, demographic change and migration, technological change, green transition, and covid-19 crisis are reshaping European societies and economies, the labour market demand is changing at an unprecedented pace. This increases the risks of growing labour shortages, and related skills shortages if there are skills mismatches. Currently, accepted and comparable cross-country indicators on skills and labour shortages are lacking, hindering skills match, cross-country cooperation and supranational policies in order to reduce these issues.
Hence, research activities are expected to take stock, also building on existing literature and studies, of the current labour shortages across Europe, by sectors and occupational groups, based on a sound methodology and ensuring that data is comparable across countries. Afterwards, proposals should identify the main causes of the labour shortages, with a particular focus on skills needs and skills gaps. The causes may include working conditions (pay, working hours, OSH, well-being at work, etc.) on labour supply. The proposals should focus on the skills

needed for the green and digital transitions with a focus on the ?transferability? of existing skills from one sector/occupation to other sectors/occupations (e.g. what is the real gap in skills).
The proposals may:

?	focus on shortages forecast;
?	effect on changing tasks/educational profiles within jobs;
?	have a regional dimension;
?	Explore the impact on labour market polarisation and segmentation;
?	Explore how big data and machine learning can complement conventional data (e.g. surveys and skills forecasts available, such as those of CEDEFOP or of the Pact for Skills)
?	Explore the ?determinants? of education choice and training choice: e.g., family background, local labour market, individual risk propensity, welfare etc.

HORIZON-CL2-2023-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-08," Integrated care solutions leading to better quality, person-centred long-term care and overcoming territorial inequalities in their provision",3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Increased understanding of integrated care and support solutions (within formal and informal long-term care (LTC), but also between social and healthcare) to enhance the quality of the LTC services and of the impact on informal carers and the formal care workforce from the perspective of their skills development and needs.
?	Promising policy practices in LTC, in particular the potential of ICT to support integrated, person-centred approaches, analysed and policy recommendations developed.

?	Policymakers at EU/national/local level are provided with evidence on territorial inequalities (e.g. rural-urban) and interdependencies, particularly in relation to gender in the need and provision of LTC and the main drivers contributing to the challenge of regional and intersectional gaps between supply of and demand for formal LTC services.
Scope: The quality of LTC is affected by a number of factors, including funding, workforce, organisation, and technology. Concerning organisation, new models of integrated care have started to emerge, which aim to structure care services around personal needs to improve user satisfaction, psychological health, and well-being.
Within many EU Member States and Associated Countries, LTC is typically funded from various sources and organised at different levels. In terms of regulation, funding and service provision, the provision of LTC services may be closely interlinked with (or be part of) policies such as those in healthcare, social care, housing and housing support services, and for people with disabilities. This horizontal division may hamper the co-ordination of care and even service provision. LTC is especially strongly interlinked with the provision of healthcare, as people with LTC needs often have healthcare needs due to multiple chronic conditions or co- morbidities. The provision of integrated care, where different professionals work closely together to address people?s healthcare and LTC needs, is thus essential. Technology can help improve the quality of LTC provision, for instance by personalising service provision, increasing users? independence, supporting quality-assurance efforts through monitoring of service provision, remote care management, etc.
Recent reforms include establishing new services, as well as measures reinforcing the integrated delivery of care. The latter measures mostly tackle sectoral disparities between healthcare and social care by setting up co-ordination structures. They are also aimed at improving local and regional management and enhancing co-operation between different providers of homecare.
In the context of ageing societies, a key challenge is to provide adequate, accessible, and affordable formal LTC services of high quality to those who need it. The availability of formal LTC services differs greatly among EU Member States. With a large increase in demand ahead, already today many people in need of LTC services cannot access or afford them. Among the barriers to ensuring equal access to adequate LTC are geographical disparities or even shortages in supply. Differences in the use of care reflect personal preferences and differences in family structures, as well as the availability and affordability of formal LTC services. For example, effective access to care is often hindered in rural and remote areas. However, data on regional differences of LTC provision is scarce.
The role of social economy as an important player in innovative practices in care provision is often highlighted. Proposals should identify best innovative practices, including in new and emerging areas, such as platform cooperativism in the field of LTC and in regularising undeclared workers in LTC.

HORIZON-CL2-2023-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-09," Addressing housing inequalities in a sustainable, inclusive and affordable way",3/14/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Provide guidance on effective measures that can increase the socio-economic integration of marginalised communities, migrants, refugees and disadvantaged groups by reducing housing inequalities and improving access to housing.
?	Provide policymakers with a comprehensive overview of how income and wealth polarisation affect the housing market against the background of changing interest rates and inflation.
?	Support policymakers in better understanding how the green and digital transition could affect housing inequalities and how ?supply-side? land use policies as well as social innovation could help address such inequalities.
?	Provide local and regional policymakers with guidance based on best practices to support the development of affordable and inclusive housing facilities.
Scope: Access to affordable and social housing as well as homelessness remain challenges to foster social inclusion and tackle entrenched poverty across Europe. Energy poverty affects nearly 34 million Europeans who are unable to afford keeping their homes warm. Housing prices have been steadily growing every year and faster than disposable income. Housing is now the highest item of expenditure for European citizens.
The top 1% wealth shares have risen again recently in Europe, and the gap between asset owners and pure income earners and social transfer recipients is increasing further. During the COVID pandemic, high-income workers suffered limited income losses and often increased their savings compared to low-income workers for which the opposite holds. These trends are likely to bring about house purchases (sales) from high-income (low-income) households, reinforcing wealth inequalities in the housing component. Research may provide a mapping of recent household wealth dynamics and their segregation implications.
The European Green Deal will affect housing markets notably through the Renovation wave and its Affordable Housing Initiative as well as through the revision of the Energy Efficiency

and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directives. Increasing the energy efficiency of buildings helps tackling energy-poverty. Research may inform policy measures that ensure energy efficiency and affordable housing go hand in hand and are accessible to all socio- economic groups. Interlinks between housing inequalities and carbon inequalities as well as mobility poverty are of interest too. Research may focus on the relation between housing inequalities and the labour mobility from regions facing job losses to regions generating new jobs in the context of the twin transition. With regard to social and affordable housing, research may shed light on the role social, green and digital innovations can play in addressing housing inequalities.
Interlinkages between the digital and green transition, economic regeneration and housing inequalities merit more attention. Links between workplace and housing inequality are multidimensional, with structural conditions, working conditions and family conditions playing important roles. Housing inequalities should not lead to new forms of discrimination in labour markets. Research may inform policy actions to ameliorate the organisation of work from home, notably for vulnerable households. New forms of work could also impact preferences for rental housing compared to homeownership. Research may also look at the role of social economy actors in addressing housing inequalities while stimulating inclusion, economic and social development.
Research should make a granular assessment of these issues for different geographical areas, tenure statuses and different household?s compositions. The gender and intergenerational dimensions are essential. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged",

?	Policymakers at EU/national/local level are provided with a comprehensive view of the risks of widening existing inequalities or create new ones as a result of the twin transition.
?	New and/or updated policies put in place in a timely manner to both address existing inequalities and mitigate potential negative socio-economic effects of the twin transitions.

Scope: The next decades will be defined by the twin green and digital transitions. The twin transitions have be just and socially fair. To achieve this, policymakers need to both recognise existing inequalities and vulnerabilities and take duly into account the possible distributional impacts of new/revised policies (e.g. the Green Deal and its Fit for 55 Package), against (updated) baseline scenarios. While some aspects of the transitions are subject to (distributional) impact assessment and have been scrutinised by policymakers and relevant stakeholders, the twin transitions might fail to address or, worse, widen existing inequalities and/or create new ones. For this reason, research under this action should:
?	Extensively investigate areas where the twin transitions ? separately and jointly ? and their driving policies aggravate existing inequalities and vulnerabilities and/or risk increasing inequalities, including dedicated explorations where the effects of the two transitions (and potentially implemented policies) mutually reinforce or mitigate each other.
?	Put dedicated focus on gender, the age distribution (incl. old age and in particular also young people and their specific challenges), spatial aspects (incl. rural areas and degree of urbanisation), education and skill proficiencies (incl. individuals who are not in education, employment, or training (NEET)), migration backgrounds, income, labour.
?	Market dimensions (incl. labour market attachment and sectoral affiliation of individuals), and other key-covariates of (financial as well as skill) vulnerabilities.
?	Identify mitigation measures to counter such inequalities, including the underlying time frames and (temporal as well as spatial) order of implementation.
?	Inform policymaking of the research findings with the double objective of i) reducing ex- ante the possibly negative socio-economic/distributional effects of green and digital policies and ii) promoting corrective policies/action aimed at reducing existing inequalities.
The proposals may be a forward-looking exercise, possibly making use of scenario building.

In as far as possible, research may also lay out the dedicated factors driving inequalities, and possibly explore them in more detail. This may include factors such as, but not limited to:
?	The role of the financial sector e.g. via green financing and the fintech-sector.
?	Digital language equity and the general (English) language proficiency.

?	Contribute to and initiate behavioural changes needed for a more resilient and just society.
?	Inform on key aspects of the impacts of loneliness in Europe by pooling of socio-economic data to existing data.
?	Provide evidence-based recommendations for social and economic policies to prevent, counter, and manage loneliness in Europe at individual and population levels.
?	Create a framework to monitor loneliness in the long-term.
?	Establish a representative network of experts, stakeholders and policymakers involved in research and policy actions addressing the socio-economic impacts of loneliness.
Scope: Loneliness is becoming an urgent public health issue that calls for effective policy interventions. In 2016, 12% of EU citizens felt lonely. With the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing, the figures have increased to 25%. Although loneliness affects citizens from all age groups, its prevalence is uneven in the Member States. The effects of loneliness are harmful for health, but also have significant impacts on social cohesion and community trust.
Several EU research projects and initiatives, such as the Pilot Project on Loneliness run by the JRC in collaboration with DG EMPL, already focus on loneliness and proposals submitted

under this topic should ideally synergise with these and capitalise on available data to support the pooling of socio-economic data to existing data on individual and societal loneliness.
This effort should capitalise on available data to identify commonly agreed socio-economic and geographical risk factors, drivers and trends of loneliness within and across Member States including of specific populations (such as teenagers, unemployed, recently retired people, third country nationals who legally reside in the EU and people with disabilities) and provide recommendations to design effective loneliness policies as well as develop tools for the long term monitoring of loneliness at the individual and population levels.
Work is also expected to nurture the public debate on loneliness and in particular on the stigma that is associated to it.
The approach will be based on a FAIR102 data-sharing culture and will promote the use of new technologies to quantify and assess the social and economic effects of loneliness in Europe.",
HORIZON-CL2-2024-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-02, Strengthen economic fairness and resilience of active labour market policies and address high unemployment,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Improve the understanding of macro effects of labour market policies on general equilibrium including displacement and substitution effects;
?	Promote skills strategies and skill development, also at sectoral level, during periods of economic downturn benefitting from lower opportunity costs;
?	Contribute to increase labour market participation and employment in a context of high unemployment and high number of job vacancies, notably in low and high skilled jobs.
Scope: Active labour market policies are widely used by European countries to improve the functioning of their labour markets by addressing skill mismatches, labour market segmentation, and by promoting the integration in the labour market of those facing difficulties in accessing it. Policies aimed at skill development could be effective in periods of low economic activity at the macroeconomic level, given that the opportunity cost of training

102	Data need to meet the FAIR principles: findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable.

programmes is lower in times of recession. These policies could facilitate the reallocation of labour, prepare the ground for a fair economic recovery, and facilitate transitions towards the green and digital sectors.
However, there have been studies post the 2007 recession arguing that training programmes have so far had only a modest effect in generating post-programme employment. Furthermore, researchers found that responses of adult learning and training to the business cycle are different for employed and not employed workers, with the participation of the latter group diminishing in times of economic downturn due to credit constraints preventing them from investing in education.
In light of such studies, more research is needed to survey the different types of active labour market policies enacted by the Member States, especially in the area of skills development during economic downturns, and their effects on people facing economic challenges, e.g. people at risk of poverty or workers whose job is at risk of automation. Proposals should focus on the ways in which active labour market policies can be strengthened to provide economic fairness and resilience.
Research activities may focus on the response of public authorities to the COVID-19 crisis and estimate their effectiveness including displacement and substitution effects. Alternatively, research could also focus on the participation of persons coming from a vulnerable socio- economic background or from regions with a high degree of unemployment (e.g. people at risk of poverty, people coming from rural communities) to active labour market policies with an aim to mapping barriers and policy responses to increase their participation. Research could also focus on the impact of active labour market policies while incorporating a gender dimension. Another research avenue could be analysing the role of active labour market policies within broader exercises to rethink employment and income protection with an aim of underpinning synergies that enhance their effect, e.g. the interplay between active labour market policies and housing allowances in the housing first approach.
Where relevant, activities should build upon existing research, draw lessons from recent policy interventions in a contextual and transdisciplinary manner and propose adjustment measures, or test them through social innovation experiments.

HORIZON-CL2-2024-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-03, Minimise costs and maximise benefits of job creation and job destruction,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Effective management of processes of job creation and job destruction triggered by macro drivers of change;
?	Different socio-demographic groups and regions are favourably affected by the creation of new green jobs and new industries;
?	The negative effects associated with the destruction of some jobs in carbon-intensive activities are mitigated so that nobody is left behind as a result of the reallocation of jobs across regions and sectors;
?	Reskill and upskill older workers and/or unskilled workers to ensure a smooth transition to the emerging jobs/sectors.
Scope: Globalisation, technological change, demographic change, green transition and other macro drivers of change are accelerating the processes of job creation and job destruction. These have profound socioeconomic effects. On the one side, they lead to changes in the status of people (e.g. from unemployed to employed); working lives are more fragmented, with less stable working relationships. On the other side, they reshape the economic landscapes and ecosystems of different sectors, often linked with technological, social and business innovation. All of these impacts underscore the need to develop effective policies to minimise costs and maximise benefit. The topic should identify the best ways to train refugees, immigrants, women, older and younger people, people affected by disabilities, unemployed and inactive, medium and low skilled employees, low and medium educated people, individuals living in rural areas, NEETs (not in education, employment, or training), since these people have fewer resources to cover transition spells.
The proposals may investigate the following issues:

?	How should the reallocation of labour within and across sectors take place to ensure social integration and that nobody is left behind?
?	How do we reskill and upskill older workers and/or unskilled workers to ensure a smooth transition to the emerging jobs/sectors?
?	What are the upskilling/re-skilling programs that work the best (maximising the benefits while minimising the costs)?
?	What are the impacts of the green transition on labour market opportunities of different and disadvantaged socio-economic groups, across economic sectors, green-vs.-brown job decompositions, and income brackets?
?	Given the pre-crisis trend of constant increase of labour market participation, how could we increase the labour market participation of under-utilised workforce?

HORIZON-CL2-2024-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-04, Social services:  economic and social returns and value added,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Well-founded evidence on the social and economic returns of social services, including interlinkages between child poverty and gaps in access to social services, and interlinkages in access to employment and access to social services.
?	Improved understanding of the channels through which social services may foster and accelerate a fair green and digital transition.
?	Identification and use of the best methodology to capture and measure the value added of the provision of social services, including informal social services, in the EU Member States and Associated Countries in different geographical areas (rural and urban).
Scope: Social services have a fundamental role in our society, safeguarding and promoting the welfare and well-being of vulnerable groups (e.g. migrants, people with disabilities, homeless, youth at risk, and more in general, unemployed people, low-income and poor households and women). The proposals should consider social services in a broad manner, including both universal social services of general interest such as healthcare, education, as well as other social services childcare, employment services, long-term care and social inclusion services for persons at risk of poverty and social exclusion (including counselling, coaching, mentoring, crisis centres or shelters, housing support services). The proposals should also take into account the unequal availability of social services between rural and urban areas. A special attention should also be given to the different roles of social services in the context of the fair green and digital transition (e.g. supporting working-age adults with caring responsibilities to take up good quality jobs, which contribute to the twin transitions).
Concerning the economic and social returns of these services, the proposals should focus on estimating the impacts from a life course perspective (including through age-dependent models), on children (development in their childhood and also into adulthood),on the

employment and income situation of adults of investments in healthcare and education, including childcare and extracurricular activities for the children, but also other services such as housing and nutrition and long term care for the elderly. Such impacts should in particular be estimated in terms of employment outcomes and household incomes.
More generally, linked with the ?beyond GDP? approach, it is important to analyse how to better measure the actual value added of the provision of public social services, primarily in terms of monetary valuation. Currently the value added of the public provision of social services is considered into national accounts at production prices (when there are no price associated to the related services) or also sometimes at the (reduced) price the related services are financed.
However, the actual added value of the provision of these services is meant to be higher than the production costs (or related reduced prices). It would be useful to reflect on the main channels to be accounted for in this respect in ensuring a better accounting of the actual level of the value added provided by public social services. Moreover, some actual estimates of the actual added value of the provision of public social services should be provided, reflecting in a more accurate way in particular both the short term impact (such as stabilisation function on the economy) and the longer term impact. These can be related to structural positive impact on employment and incomes, or savings allowed in terms of preventing adverse impacts, such as in terms of preventing permanent adverse spells ? such as health outcomes or early school leaving ? or transitory periods such as unemployment or inactivity of social services provided.

HORIZON-CL2-2024-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-05, Social dialogue in the new world of work,2/7/2024,RIA,10/4/2023,,,2.00 to 3.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Assessing the impact of trade unions and employers? organisations on employment and social outcomes.
?	Analysis of the distributional costs related to the activities of social partners for their members.

?	Improving representation forms available to non-standard workers in the social dialogue by involving social partners.
Scope: Social dialogue plays a crucial role in the functioning of the European social market economic model. Through constructive negotiation between employers and employees, social dialogue can deliver a more competitive economy while also improving working conditions. However, the profound changes in the world of work kick-started by digitalisation, globalisation, and the proliferation of non-standard forms of work raise a number of constraints that hinder the ability of social dialogue to effectively steer the labour markets through economic and social transformations. Some of these constraints deal with the current legislative framework while others are tied to the deterioration of the employer-employee relationship on which social dialogue was first built.
There is an acute need for more innovative research that investigates the impact of the transforming world of work on the capacity of social actors to engage in social dialogue, as well as its effectiveness. Moreover, innovative research is needed to highlight opportunities arising from digitalisation that social partners need to seize in order to deliver positive socio-economic outcomes.
Research activities should focus on the interplay between non-standard forms of work (temporary employment; temporary agency work, part-time work, platform work, and other forms of non-standard employment) and social dialogue. Alternately, they can investigate legislative barriers prohibiting social partners from engaging in dialogue, such as competition law in the case of self-employed workers. Research proposals should also investigate if the current legal framework remains fit for purpose and the ways in which it can be adapted to respond to the changing realities of the world of work. Proposals should analyse the outcomes of social dialogue in industries where non-standard forms of work are proliferated and where in-work poverty is present. Furthermore, they should investigate new innovative ways in which social partners have surmounted the previously mentioned barriers. Research activities should also focus on the specific national or regional circumstances in which social dialogue developed and how these are affecting its effectiveness today, and its ability to respond to the changes in the evolving world of work.
Where relevant, activities should build upon existing research, draw lessons from recent policy interventions in a contextual and transdisciplinary manner and propose adjustment measures, or test them through social innovation experiments.

?	Established guiding principles based on human rights and European values on how to approach long term future opportunities and challenges posed by artificial intelligence and related technologies.
?	Structurally enhanced capacities to foresee, evaluate and manage the long term opportunities and challenges associated with artificial intelligence and related technologies.
?	Well founded and prioritised recommendations for European policy on R&I and in other key areas aimed at :
o	Ensuring that Europe is prepared to exploit the opportunities for the benefit of citizens and society, and at the same time face the challenges raised by potential developments and deployments of artificial intelligence and related technologies based on science and evidence as well as human rights and European values, and
o	Reinforcing Europe?s capacity to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in ways aligned to human rights and European values.
Scope: The history of ?artificial intelligence? technologies (AI) is marked by great optimism and expectation, sometimes followed by disappointment. However, we have recently seen a sustained upsurge in interest and the successful uptake and application of AI in a variety of significant areas such as drug discovery, autonomous vehicles, social media, industrial robotics, and logistics, to name a few. We have witnessed significant successes in the development and deployment of machine learning, particularly for tasks normally associated with human perception103. We have also seen significant successes in symbolic and logic-driven AI for problems that require reasoning about constraints, automated reasoning, planning, etc.104 AI has had significant impact in the arts and humanities, and AI-based methods and tools are becoming more widely used in the cultural arena.105
Nevertheless, today the collection of computer technologies commonly labelled artificial intelligence, along with related technologies for instance in the fields of data science, neuroscience and biotechnology, already show the potential to disrupt and impact the rights of

individuals and the wellbeing of societal structures. For example, there have been many documented case studies where AI-based applications have exhibited undesired gender and racial bias106. AI systems have been (mis-)used to micro-target and influence voters in elections as well as in the creation and dissemination of disinformation107, and otherwise impact on human agency and autonomy. Many ethical issues arise in the development of AI systems, such as their use in medical devices, brain-computer interfaces, reasoning about human mental and emotion state, etc.108
Concerns are often raised that AI technologies may imply major societal disruptions such as massive job displacements due to the increasing use of AI-drive automation and robotics, while research show that AI can also help filling gaps in workforce109110.
In 2018, the European Commission established the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (HLEG-AI), which was tasked with developing a set of ethics guidelines for Europe that would help ensure that AI systems be human-centric and trustworthy. The importance of a human-centric approach to AI has been a cornerstone of EU policy-making in the field for several years and is the clearly articulated position of the EU. The European Commission published a pioneering draft AI Act in April 2021, the first legal framework on AI in Europe, which addresses the potential risks of using AI111. The Horizon Europe work programme under Cluster 4 is funding related research and innovation actions under the header ?Leadership in AI based on trust?.
The common principle across all of these EU initiatives are seven key requirements for trustworthy AI112, as proposed by the HLEG-AI and adopted by the European Commission, as well as the importance of protecting the fundamental rights of individuals113.
Against this backdrop, before being faced with a ?fait-accompli? in terms of potentially undesirable influence of AI on the European society and economy and to make sure that all the beneficial potential of AI deployment is fully realised, we should anticipate and prepare for possible and high impact scenarios.
The proposal should cover all the following aspects:

?	Decisive contributions to develop a sound European capacity building on the long term human and societal implications of AI, building, as appropriate, on previous work of the HLEG-AI, ADRA114, or other relevant European and national AI initiatives.

?	A solid scientific approach, providing an in-depth analysis of successful existing deployment of AI and the impact they have on European economy and society. Such analysis should also significantly contribute to awareness raising of such deployments, providing a reality check of capabilities/benefits, but also limitations of current AI solutions, and how the latter are currently addressed.
?	Scenario based analysis of future long term potential benefits to citizens and societies, as well as an analysis of related challenges and threats.
?	Based on this, proposals should elaborate a set of guiding principles, ensuring a broad support and appropriate involvement of other relevant AI initiatives.
?	Proposals need to take a multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial approach, and engage with a wide set of stakeholders, including research organisations, enterprises, citizens 115 , policymakers, public private partnerships such as the AI, Data and Robotics Partnership, and other relevant EU projects and initiatives around AI.
?	European policy actions should be proposed in a priority order, notably in the area of research and innovation but not excluding other important policy areas, that would serve to strengthen European preparedness and resilience in the face of future developments within AI and related emerging technologies as well as to guide the development and deployment of these technologies in a desirable direction.
Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities and networks, such as the HLEG-AI and other initiatives funded by the European Union. Funded proposals should also take into account existing EU policy in the area, such as Excellence and trust in artificial intelligence under A Europe fit for the digital age116. Furthermore, the proposals should seek synergies with closely related actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020117.",

?	to develop cultural competence that enables researchers to work productively and meaningfully in teams that span countries, sectors, disciplines and other cultural divides
?	to promote interdisciplinary research teams around key societal challenges
Proposals under this topic should therefore combine communication, management and collaborative skills with behavioural sciences and implementation sciences for the lifelong training of researchers in ?transferrable? skills, in the course of their curricula or as part of the updating of their professional careers. A focus on teamworking will be an asset in the career and job paths and will gradually lead to achieve and maximise impact on and in our societies, economies and democracies.
Efforts should be directed to identify, evaluate and suggest methodologies for training of researchers in behavioural and implementation sciences and transversal skills, in the course of their curricula or as part of the updating of their professional careers.

?	Develop and apply methods to support the use of arts in education and interventions to foster cultural awareness and expression and to assess their impacts on the development of competences and inclusion of all children and young people.
?	Inform policies, programmes and actions using arts in education and contributing to foster cultural awareness and expression, identify existing gaps and effective actions to reach most children and young people and develop recommendations.

Scope: Arts in education and developing cultural awareness and expression - one of the key competences for lifelong learning119 have value in themselves. They are also used to develop creativity, innovation, critical and design thinking, communication, collaboration and intercultural skills and, more broadly, for inclusive education and training systems, democracy and civic engagement, but stronger evidence is needed to better understand and assess these impacts. Research evidence is also missing on whether, and how, education and training systems have capacity to support learners in developing cultural awareness and expression.
Proposals should support policymakers and professional development providers in identifying effective actions and gaps in their systems, and better understanding how their investments could be improved. Proposals should include a lifelong learning perspective (early childhood education and care, school, vocational education and training and higher education, non-formal learning), and assess national, regional and local support for partnerships, for example between education institutions and arts and cultural heritage organisations.

?	Contribute to improve the working conditions in social economy organisations, including in the care sector.
Scope: Almost 3 million social economy entities in Europe offer concrete and innovative solutions to key challenges EU society faces e.g. they create quality jobs, contribute to equal opportunities and socioeconomic inclusion of disadvantaged groups (including people with disabilities), they also play an important role in Europe?s welfare systems and help revitalise Europe?s rural and depopulated areas, therefore contributing to the Long-term vision for the EU?s rural areas.
The social economy can also help implement the principles of the European Pillar for Social Rights and deliver on its 2021 Action Plan and the 2030 headline targets e.g. by increasing the employment rate and the reduction of the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion.
There is an uneven development of the social economy within the EU and a major untapped economic and job creation potential for the social economy in several Member States and regions. The Social Economy Action Plan121, adopted in December 2021 puts forward measures to help further mobilise the potential of the Social Economy.
The proposals should provide a comprehensive analysis of the extent to which social economy contributes to countering social exclusion in the EU, in Associated Countries and in Third Countries, what services it provides, and compare efficiency, cost and quality aspects of services provided by the social economy with those of other providers. The proposals can tackle (one or more) different angles of socioeconomic exclusion. For instance, the role of social economy as an important player in innovative practices in care provision is often highlighted. Research could identify best innovative practices, including in new and emerging areas in the field of care provisions.
As the availability and use of formal care services differ significantly between Member States and regions, research should investigate the role of social economy between different countries and the drivers of these differences in order to design effective long-term care and social economy policies. Residents in rural areas in particular can suffer with limited access to long- term care services, while social economy organisations are often motivated to provide services based on local needs and can play a revitalising role in the economies of rural regions.
Research should also investigate what are the working conditions in social economy organisations, including in the care sector.
Proposals should aim to provide policymakers with recommendations in the field of social economy support.

Proposals should use quantitative and qualitative methods to analyse transitions between educational levels (including between general education and vocational training) and/or between education/training and the labour market and improve the evidence base for policy decisions by addressing several interrelated research questions, such as: what are the determinants of participation and completion rates in upper secondary and tertiary education and how can they evolve in the post-COVID world?

Scope: Recent research highlights that new technologies may increase or reduce overall employment opportunities: they tend to increase them in the presence of strong productivity gains or if they create new tasks that are best carried out using human skills (possible example: a nurse using medical machines to perform checks previously carried out by a doctor), but can reduce them if the substitution of labour by machines dominates (possible example: self-service supermarket counters). However, there is still a limited understanding of which types of technologies and technology applications are particularly promising from the perspective of

enhancing rather than displacing human skills and of creating employment opportunities as well as decent working conditions.
Some authors argue that recent technological change has been biased towards automation and has focused insufficiently on creating new tasks where labour can be productively employed, with associated declining labour shares in national income, rising inequality and lower productivity growth. This highlights the need to better understand the complementarity between new technologies and skills that can serve as basis for policy recommendations that complement and enhance human skills, such as targeting investment subsidies. Policy may for instance want to prioritise public investment support in areas where innovation is more complementary to existing skills (possible examples: education and healthcare as opposed to pattern recognition ?across the board?), including of people without high formal qualifications (or for other disadvantaged groups, e.g. those affected by disabilities), or it may want to support the development of skills complementary to emerging technologies with targeted education and training programmes. Both types of policy interventions could improve the impacts of new technologies on employment prospects, decent working conditions and social inclusion, but their design requires opening the ?black box? of technology-skill demand complementarity.
Examples of research activities carried out under this topic include the development of criteria to assess the complementarity of specific new technologies with human skills and vice versa. This could include an analysis of specific applications of new technologies (such as artificial intelligence technologies and robotics), possibly with a sectoral or occupational focus. It could also include the development of policy recommendations to support technologies and skills/training courses that are conducive to a digital transition that creates more good jobs. Clustering and cooperation with other selected projects under this call and other relevant projects is strongly encouraged.",

?	Improved capabilities of European Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners for a fast and flexible analysis of huge amounts of heterogeneous data through the application of robust and advanced tools, allowing them to efficiently fight criminals and terrorists who use novel technologies;
?	Enhanced and modern analysis of heterogeneous data as well as training curricula that take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, cost-benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data, providing reports that can be used in court;
?	The work of European Police Authorities in the area of fighting crime and terrorism is supported by big data analysis that is in accordance with data minimisation principles and high privacy standards, with clearly identified challenges, adequate models and scientifically validated technical options for tackling the challenge proposed and solutions developed that meet the challenge.
Scope: With the constant increase of technological developments, the processing of large datasets is inevitable for police work in today?s digital world. As a wide range of products and services become digitalised and interconnected, Police Authorities need adequate technologies to properly detect and counter emerging threats. Big data analysis also provides invaluable opportunities to carry out investigations, identify suspects, reveal or anticipate crime patterns or links between previously unconnected events or actors. In particular, there is a continuous need for handling large, complex and unstructured datasets, in order to gather, normalise, process, connect, prioritise, visualise the data (including text, image, audio and video) in ways that facilitate the extraction of actionable intelligence, while ensuring interoperability between existing systems and standards in different Member States. Solutions to perform temporal and geospatial analyses are needed too. The successful proposal should have a clear strategy related to quality data sets to be used for training and testing. The innovation efforts should provide support to web-based data analysis that can facilitate e.g.

the fight against hate speech, human trafficking, terrorism or child sexual exploitation in an online environment. The work should include surface, deep and dark web.
Examples of relevant techniques include: examination of digitally captured signatures, identification of voice cloning and of deepfakes; detection and recognition of persons/objects/logos; speaker diarisation and identification; speech recognition and transcription into text; automatic classification of text based on risk factors; optical character recognition; named entity recognition; concept extraction, extraction of entities and relations between them in unstructured text; multimodal analytics, in order to discover insights and patterns in large volumes of data through clustering, as well as the identification of user communities and key actors in the social networks being formed online; automatic correlations among all available sources, as well as cross-checking, cross-matching and mapping information between different cases, i.e. cross-reference with existing records in databases of Police Authorities. Identification of perpetrators can also be enhanced by detecting their online behaviour and habits, e.g. which days/hours they are used to login/logout.
Taking advantage of these modern technologies will require Police Authorities to move away from business models based on data input to data evaluation. It will require robust and reliable information management structures that encompass all aspects from data collection to handling, evaluation, exploitation and data security. In particular, key principles such as data minimisation should apply to ensure that Police Authorities conduct data analysis in full compliance with fundamental rights and EU privacy standards. For example, it may be necessary to filter and reduce large datasets to what is relevant for operational support activities and in investigations, and/or apply methods such as differential privacy. Hence, all these efforts should also reconcile big data analysis and data protection, i.e.: explore challenges to conduct big data analysis in accordance with data minimisation principles and high privacy standards, propose possible models and scientific options to tackle the challenge, and develop solutions (digital tools) that meet the challenge, focusing on triage and clustering functions. Possibilities of assessing and preventing bias and discrimination as a result of big data analysis should be analysed too. The successful proposal should thus help framing the issue of big data analysis for Police Authorities, providing guidelines as well as operational tools to comply with EU data protection standards.
The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as create synergies with similar on- going security research projects from the Calls 2021-2022 on Fighting Crime and Terrorism in the area of modern information analysis, in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community.
Possibilities of coordination with related activities funded through the Internal Security Fund (such as the European Anti-Cybercrime Technology Development Association) and the Digital Europe Programme should be analysed too.",
HORIZON-CL3-2023-FCT-01-02, A harmonized European forensics approach on drugs analysis,11/23/2023,IA,6/29/2023,,,Around 4.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	European Police Authorities, forensic institutes and other relevant security practitioners are equipped by modern means of chemical analysis (composition) in drugs aimed at facilitating the cross-matching of seized drugs to labs and the establishment of links between cases, including by developing protocols to quickly exchange information on new substances;
?	Improved and uniform EU-wide approach for the collection of evidence regarding illicit drugs-related overdoses, that would allow for choosing adequate responses in countering the drug-related problems;
?	Improved collection and availability of forensic evidence, that could be used in court by the authorities, in direct violence, kidnapping or human trafficking cases, as well as reinforced prevention of such cases thanks to sensors/kits that are reliable, lawful, fast and easy-to-use;
?	Enhanced perception of citizens in public and private spaces that Europe is an area of freedom, justice and security.
Scope: Proposals are expected to address one of the following options:

Option A: A harmonised European approach is needed on the study of chemical analysis (composition) in drugs, to
1)	facilitate the cross-matching of seized drugs to labs and the establishment of links between cases, including by developing protocols to quickly exchange information on new substances;
2)	tackle forensic challenges related to illicit drugs-related overdoses.

The production of synthetic drugs in the EU is continuously expanding. The laboratories producing synthetic drugs are becoming more professional and versatile, resulting in an increased production and a greater flexibility in terms of which substances are produced, how they are produced and how/where they are sold.

On the one hand, criminal networks and criminals active in the production of synthetic drugs display a particularly high degree of specialisation. Thus, a modern and harmonised European approach to the analysis of the drugs composition would help to cross-match seized drugs and illegal drugs markets to labs and make the links between cases, allowing a cross-border exchange of such evidence.
On the other hand, choosing appropriate responses that are likely to be effective in dealing with a particular drug-related problem requires a clear understanding of the problem, supported by the strongest available evidence. However, an obstacle in this process is the very limited or fully absent evidence, as it is the case in finding responses aimed at reducing overdose-related deaths. Namely, autopsies with full toxicology are underdeveloped in many Member States, making comparison at EU level difficult and aggregated numbers on overdose deaths not fully representative. Member States called to make this issue more comparable EU- wide. To this end, a modern chemical analysis of the drugs composition and a unified EU- wide approach would provide a significant support, also in view of commitments of the EU Drugs Strategy 2021-2025.
Option B: A reliable and easy-to-use detection of chemical submission drugs in beverages and urine.
GHB (Gamma-hydroxybutyrate) is one of the drugs known as ?club drugs? or ?date rape drugs?. Notably when mixed with alcohol, it has a depressant effect and causes drowsiness, rendering the person defenceless and unable to remember what happened. Sexual assaults facilitated by chemical submission drugs have a growing tendency in Europe. Thus, Police Authorities and forensic practitioners need modern methods and technologies that enable better prevention against and investigation of different forms of violence and assault supported by these drugs. To this end, the successful proposal should aim at developing wearable, reusable, portable sensors and/or kits that would provide a fast response, without the need for additional instrumentation, and would be easy to use by Police Authorities in the field (i.e., in places where citizens are more at risk of ingesting GHB drugs through drinks and beverages). Furthermore, such solutions should provide results that are reliable, safe and simple to interpret when looking for and collecting evidence of such drugs that can be used in court. Gender-related impacts as well as legal and ethical challenges of such solutions should be fully considered in the development process.
Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Similarly, coordination with projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2022-BM-01-03: Better, more portable and quicker analysis and detection for customs and HORIZON-CL3- 2023-BM-01-04: Interoperability of systems and equipment at tactical level; between equipment and databases; and/or between databases of threats and materials would be welcome.

12	In the context of this Destination, ?Police Authorities? means public authorities explicitly designated by national law, or other entities legally mandated by the competent national authority, for the prevention, detection and/or investigation of terrorist offences or other criminal offences, specifically excluding police academies, forensic institutes, training facilities as well as border and customs authorities.

?	Strengthened resilience of local communities against crime and radicalisation, lowered feeling of insecurity and improved law enforcing;
?	Negative factors in local communities are identified early, possible threats are detected, and crime reporting is enhanced;
?	Better recognition for community diversity within neighbourhoods, and tailored approaches to milieus including communities traditionally not engaging with statutory authorities resulting in comprehensive community empowerment;
?	The interactions, and potential feedback between CP and alternatives to incarceration are explored;
?	Identification and EU wide dissemination of validated community policing best practices;
?	New methodologies, tools and adoption of technological support are developed; and
?	Training curricula for Police Authorities are developed on community policing in non- homogenous local milieus with social complexities, including balancing of majority needs while recognising expectations of minorities and/or sub-groups.
Scope: Community policing (CP) is an integral part of policing focusing on cooperation with local community for better understanding challenges and the given group needs and meeting them. From both a theoretical and a practical point of view, three ways of delivering CP may be outlined: reactive, proactive, and co-active - based on community consultations and common actions. While performing such actions, police provides information, initiates and participates in programs to prevent crime and ensures the protection of citizens in cooperation with other institutions. CP aims to create opportunities for positive, mutually respectful interactions between civilians and the police, to increase citizens` trust and enhance the ability of police to enforce the law. To maximise the impact of CP actions, proposals should analyse its potential relations with introduction of innovative alternatives to imprisonment.
Nowadays, Police Authorities, while carrying out their duties to provide community security, are faced with numerous economic and demographic challenges. As a consequence, more efficient solutions, tools and methodologies are sought. First responders cope with growing communities, tighter budgets, and diverse, quickly evolving milieus in their areas of responsibility, regularly facing challenges that initial professional training could not prepare them for. Moreover, rapidly changing social, economic and political environment, both domestically and internationally, complicates these problems and fuels new tensions.
New approaches should cover internal review of Police Authorities? personnel training, possible change of attitudes and communication language, or countering existing misconceptions and biases. International exchange of validated best practices is encouraged. Proposals should eventually integrate societal findings, relevant new or already existing technologies and legal framework into a comprehensive CP model. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national

or EU-funded projects. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological and societal dimensions of CP in a balanced way.

market is developed, as well as the set of respective prevention, investigative and policy countermeasures; and
?	Improved knowledge within European security institutions regarding developments in the field of organised crime and prospects for the future.
Scope: The Crime-as-a-service (CaaS) model proliferates and becomes a prominent feature not only for the cybercriminal underground, but also for traditional criminals hiring specialised digital and financial services. Thus, availability of exploit kits and other services not only serves cybercriminals with low technical skills, but also makes the operations of mature and organised threat actors more efficient. Recently Malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings on the Dark Web increased, of which ransomware affiliate programs seem to be the most prominent.
The shape of the organised crime evolves, apart from traditionally closed, clandestine criminal structures, and investigators are increasingly confronted with modern, flexible, specialised and ""multi-ethnic"" organisations with a global operational range. As these groups seem not to work within permanent multi-layered structures but with various actors delivering on demand services, some of the organised crime characteristics might be subject to a review. Actors in the shadow economy while seeking to maximise their profit, take instant advantage of new ways of operations, exploring and benefiting from modern technologies and organisational schemes to achieve their goals, thus resulting in dynamic transformation of subject networks. The observed trend may be a challenge for the codified laws and definitions of organised crime as supposedly sealed off to outsiders and characterised by fixed and permanent cooperation. In order to enhance the fight against organised crime at the European level, there is a need for distinct research to gain comprehensive insight into the internal workings of modern organised crime structures and their marketplaces.
Coordination among the successful proposal from this topic as well as with the successful proposals under topics HORIZON-CL3-2023-FCT-01-06: Enhancing tools and capabilities to fight advanced forms of cyber threats and cyber-dependent crimes and HORIZON-CL3-2024- FCT-01-06: Tracing of cryptocurrencies transactions related to criminal purposes should be envisaged to avoid duplication, and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.",

?	Identification of best practices of international law enforcement and judicial cooperation networks; and-
?	Development of multi-stakeholders strategies, including novel investigation schemes and information sharing mechanisms.
Scope: While cyber-attacks, notably ransomware and distributed denials or services, are getting more sophisticated, law enforcement officers need to develop strategies to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the numerous elements contributing to the attack (Virtual Private Networks - VPNs, Bulletproof Hosting ? BPH, Remote Access Trojans ? RATs, botnets, Dark Web platforms, crypto-ransomware, Criminal Phone Banks, Pseudonyms, Advanced Persistent Threat groups ? APTs, Internet infrastructure abuse (e.g. DNS), etc.). Having in mind that these are offered today in a form of Crime-as-a-service for anyone willing to pay, there is growing number of cases where authorities have to launch and conduct advanced inquiries. Investigators need timely access to relevant data and expertise of a different nature and belonging to different categories of stakeholders (e.g. other Police Authorities or Internet service providers). As geographical boundaries become irrelevant in the commission of crime, criminal investigations have to become cooperative, joint actions. It does not seem feasible for a comprehensive investigation of contemporary organised crime to be conducted by a single investigator or even a single force. This technical and organisational complexity together with the cross-border nature of cyberattacks requires cutting-edge investigative approaches, gathering a large range of expertise as well as trusted information sharing mechanisms across communities (including secured platforms). In addition, it is necessary to enhance cybercrime intelligence picture notably by enhancing reporting mechanism of cyber-dependent criminal activities. Development of multi-stakeholders strategies, including novel investigation schemes and information sharing mechanisms, is necessary in order to enhance prevention and deterrence of these forms of cyber and cyber- dependent crime. Project should also investigate the legal background and identify any related shortcomings so lawful access and processing of subject data has a valid legal foundation.

?	Increased understanding of Police Authorities regarding the emerging (digital and especially physical) threats of the fast-developing environment of Internet of Things;
?	Modern tools to tackle new and emerging forms of crime pertaining to the development of Internet of Things are provided to European Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners, which take into account legal and ethical rules of operation, cost- benefit considerations, as well as fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data;
?	Lawful access and exploitation of evidence in the environment of the Internet of Things are fortified;
?	Best practices (legal, organisational, technical) to access and exploit Internet of Things in the course of investigation are strengthened, including by developing relevant tools and training materials.
Scope: Internet of Things (IoT) connects practically everything and makes everything more vulnerable as well. IoT devices increasingly benefit from the convergence and integration of technologies, such as machine learning, real-time analytics as well as 5G that will provide faster and more reliable connections for all devices.
There are a number of implications particular to IoT devices, which have been consistently highlighted by researchers and Police Authorities. For example, the vulnerability of IoT devices may be exploited by criminals who seek to collect personal data, compromise user credentials or spy on organisations or people. Furthermore, IoT devices may represent a threat that goes beyond the digital world, i.e. they may become an increasingly physical threat, since they find applications in, e.g., industry and infrastructure, as well as in building smart cities. Malevolent actions against connected devices with direct physical impact (e.g. car-to-car communication, hacking of vehicles, hospitals, nuclear plants) are also a growing concern.
Therefore, the successful proposal should help Police Authorities understand the implications of the fast-developing IoT environment in order to keep pace with the evolution of its applications, recognise and tackle the emerging (digital and especially physical) threats that this may pose.
At the same time, IoT proliferation will provide opportunities for the Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners to collect a new range of data in relation with criminal activities. New investigating schemes are needed for Police Authorities to access and exploit

IoTs evidence, in compliance with EU values. To this end, the proposal should examine the extent to which, e.g., modern European vehicle models, smart TVs, private surveillance systems, virtual assistants or voice control systems can be considered as sources of evidence for the collection and analysis of data, as well as how such data can be used for deriving indicators of an imminent threat.
The research should assess legal, organisational and technical implications of IoT development in the context of investigations, including e.g. privacy issues, and propose strategies, including training materials, tools and path to standards that would foster ?by design? a lawful access to relevant evidences.

?	Development of safer justice outcomes through an increased understanding of the EU- wide legal aspects of online investigations, including undercover, in the area of child sexual abuse;
?	Improved understanding of the EU-wide legislative hurdles that impact (undercover) investigations in this area;
?	Modern and robust methods at the European level are proposed at all steps of an investigative process in this area, overcoming various types of biases and obstacles to the collection of evidence that is admissible in court and respects the dignity, privacy, protection of personal data and anonymity of victims;
?	Forensic practitioners, Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners active in online (including undercover) child sexual abuse investigations benefit from innovative guidelines, manuals, education and training curricula.
Scope: The use of online undercover investigation techniques is an important asset for Police Authorities in infiltrating the networks of sexual abusers of children. These methods have proven very effective in understanding offender behaviour and interaction of online service providers, and have ultimately facilitated the shutting down of communication channels used by these offenders, as well as their prosecution. An increasingly important need for Police Authorities? activity in these spaces is the ability to effectively infiltrate particularly dangerous online groups of offenders, while making sure that the evidence obtained will be admissible in court. EU values and fundamental rights shall stay in the core of any future measures. Research in this area should tackle legislative hurdles to collecting evidence in online, including undercover, investigations of child sexual abuse, leading to guidelines and manuals that would make the capability available across the EU to more effectively target these offenders. The results of this research topic (training, manuals guidelines) should be shared among all European Police Authorities, notably via CEPOL, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding under this topic. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as create synergies with similar on-going security research projects from the Calls 2021-2022 on Fighting Crime and Terrorism in the area of digital forensics and countering child sexual abuse, in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

HORIZON-CL3-2024-FCT-01-04, Radicalisation and gender,11/20/2024,RIA,6/27/2024,,,Around 4.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Improved understanding of motivation of women and girls for supporting extremist ideologies, such as grievance and stigmatisation;
?	Improved understanding of the role of masculinity in men and boys? motivation for the support of extreme ideologies;
?	Better understanding of the group dynamics at play during processes of radicalisation, including factors for factionalism and potential splinters in terrorist organisations;
?	Development of strategies aimed at enhancing the use of motivation factor in detection, prevention and de-radicalisation efforts;
?	European Police Authorities, Prison Authorities, social care workers, teachers and other P/CVE practitioners benefit from modern and validated tools, skills and training curricula to identify early symptoms of radicalisation;

?	Design girls and women's empowerment approaches through legal, financial and/or cultural means aimed at tackling the root causes of radicalisation and extremism.
Scope: Terrorism resulting from radicalisation and violent extremism is a serious threat to European security. Part of the complexity of these phenomena lies in the fact that there is neither a single pathway to radicalisation nor a single terrorist profile. Support of extremists is an effect of individual clusters of psychological, personal, social, economic and political reasons. From a gender perspective, women's radicalisation and involvement in violent extremist groups remain relatively under-researched, poorly understood and possibly characterized by misconceptions about women?s exclusion from decision-making processes, as well as their significant underrepresentation in bodies countering the phenomena. In situations of conflict and violence, women are often seen as passive, victims, subordinate and maternal, while these could be assumptions reinforcing gender stereotypes. In order to improve understandings of radicalization and gender we need to study how and why gender norms appear as an increasingly contested area of politics with strong mobilizing power. What role gender norms and equality policies play in stabilizing and destabilizing social and

political order, and how ideas and norms about gender equality make people react, mobilize and engage politically, at present, in the past and in the future. The entry point for prevention and de-radicalisation efforts are local communities, which are both stakeholders and partners of the law enforcement in this process. Activities aimed at youngsters and adults have to be gender sensitive, and research has to deliver tailored advice and solutions adequately, and proportionately addressing all critical issues.
Community policing with its multidisciplinary approach seeks the cooperation of local communities and the broad range of public authorities in its efforts of building safe environments. However this efforts should recognise not only cultural, social and economic diversity of the milieus, but as mentioned above also be gender sensitive.

Moreover, the EU Counter-Terrorism Agenda adopted in 2020 outlines that Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) will identify best practices and approaches of community policing and engagement to build trust with and among communities, thus research under this topic should also build upon the work done by RAN.

?	Enhanced modelling capabilities for security practitioners and policy-makers due to the identification of potential new vulnerabilities and data available, and improved support to planning of respective resources and activities.
Scope: Public spaces such as squares, sport venues, shopping districts, places of worship, and mass transport systems have been the target of terrorist attacks causing significant loss of lives and causing societal insecurity. Means to carry out such attacks range from sophisticated, and well-planned scenarios including several coordinated attackers using explosives and firearms, to low-cost, low-tech attacks making use of common products. Today specific urban furniture like benches, bus shelters, flower boxes, etc. already have double functions controlling access to protected areas, which answers to some of the low-cost attacks. The next logical step seems to expand their functions further and adopt new functionalities to better respond to the terrorist threats, such as for CBRN-E ones. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects, as well as seek to exploit potential synergies with the successful proposal(s) funded underHORIZON-CL3-2024-BM-01-05: Detection and tracking of illegal and trafficked goods.
In recent years, in some pilot actions some street furniture, including bins and bus shelters have become smart as they have been equipped with environmental sensors, wireless modules, or microcontrollers becoming part of the IoT infrastructure, and one of the components of the future smart cities. Proposals should focus on exploitation and integration of existing sensors within the public space small architectures. Traditional sensors and surveillance platforms like the Automatic Number-Plates Recognition (ANPR), cameras or image analysis systems are not in the scope of this topic unless their integration with new sensors is considered, and the added value of networked systems demonstrated. Proposals should present relevant challenges and opportunities for future applications of CBRN-E detection capacities in small architecture, including prospects of scalability, real-time processing, and cooperation of networked systems.
Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community.

?	Modern training curricula for Police Authorities, Prosecutors, as well as judicial actors are developed on tracing, seizing and handling cryptocurrencies in the course of investigation.
Scope: Cryptocurrencies are a widely used method by criminals, including terrorists, to transfer or conceal funds due to their anonymity, ease of use and lack of international borders and restrictions (exactly same aspects that make use of traditional bank routes difficult for them). With the raise of crime-as-a-service market, and growth in the number of connected transactions, use of cryptocurrency as one of the money laundering typology better tracing of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to keep the ground in the fight against crime and terrorism. On top of it all, clandestine cryptocurrency activities are increasingly facilitated by new developments such as high privacy decentralised exchanges, which while used by perpetrators frustrate the efforts of Police Authorities to detect and recover criminal assets as well as to prevent fraudulent transactions. The future of cryptocurrencies and the extent to which criminals and terrorists will use them will depend on factors such as anonymity, future regulation, law enforcement activities and security of the systems. Innovation should explore these considerations and propose mitigation measures, from legal, organisational, and technical perspectives (including the development of tools and relevant trainings to enhanced tractability of cryptocurrencies transactions.

?	Increased border surveillance capabilities, better performing and more cost-efficient, with data and fundamental rights protection by design;
?	Better surveillance of border areas, supporting fight against illegal activities across external borders, as well as safety of people and operators in the border areas, including favouring border crossings through border crossing points;
?	More efficient and more flexible solutions (including for relocation, reconfiguration and rapid deployment capabilities) than physical barriers to deter and monitor irregular border crossings outside border crossing points.
Scope: External borders of the European Union and of the Schengen area, ranging from those closer to the Mediterranean to the Nordic Countries external land borders, present different border surveillance challenges. These differences may lead to difficulties in efficiently monitoring them, deterring illegal activities across the external borders, as well as trafficking of human beings and exploitation of irregular migration that avoid border crossing points.
Furthermore, the border surveillance capabilities? needs along borders may change in time, often just within a year or a season, and/or allow to respond and adapt within a relatively short notice. Solutions should hence allow re-orienting capacity and resources accordingly (through physical portability and/or other approaches).
Cooperation for surveillance along borders requires compatibility and interoperability among legacy and planned systems. Proposed solutions should allow higher interoperability cross- border among EU and Associated Countries practitioners, cross-systems and across the multiple authorities.

Compatibility and integration with the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) is essential, and compatibility and/or exploitation of other information sharing environments, including the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) would be an additional asset.
Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): networked deployable, and possibly mobile, semi-autonomous surveillance towers; IoT and advanced mesh connectivity; Virtual and Augmented Reality for enhanced C2 and situational awareness; integrated wide area RPAS management; advanced sensors for geolocalisation; passive, low-energy systems; artificial intelligence.
Equipment and technologies enabling border surveillance should contribute to cost and energy efficiency, limit their environmental impact and be more and more sustainable once operational in the future. This may be addressed, for example, by integrating opportunities of circular economy, self-sustained equipment, lower emissions and/or environmental footprints.
The proposed solutions should include, by design, the protection of fundamental rights such as privacy, and/or the application of privacy-enhancing technologies. They should also ensure secure data collection, access, encryption and decision support processes.
EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research, should it deliver on its goals and when compatible with applicable legislation, with the support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).
Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes projects. In particular, proposals should build on achievements and findings or relevant recent EU-funded civil security research projects, as well as projects from topic HORIZON-CL3-2021-BM-01- 01: Enhanced security and management of borders, maritime environment, activities and transport, by increased surveillance capability, including high altitude, long endurance aerial support, and other relevant research.
Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available; and on the engagement with the Agency during the implementation of the project. This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should foresee that Frontex will observe projects? pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community. Cross-community and cross-authority synergies within civil security can be an asset, for

example in relation to combat crime and terrorism (i.e. across external borders) and Disaster- Resilient Society (regarding natural hazards and disasters).",
HORIZON-CL3-2023-BM-01-02," Identify, inspect, neutralise Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) at sea",11/23/2023,RIA,6/29/2023,,,Around 4.90-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased capabilities to detect, classify, inspect, assess and neutralise UXO at sea;
?	Improved safety and security for maritime economic operators and for EU citizens.
Scope: A large amount of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO), estimated by experts in the tens of thousands tons, lay in European seas and often close to European shores. Most of this material dates back to World War I and World War II. Estimates for the timing of material corrosion suggest that much of this material is likely to be an increasing safety risk in the next 10 years. And this would happen while coasts, shores and seas have more and more value for economic and civilian activities, ranging from seafood production to communications, transport, trade and sustainable energy production. UXO hence represents a substantial safety risk for economic operators at sea, and citizens, as well as for the environment.
UXO represents also a security risk, as some of this dangerous material is relatively easily retrievable and could be misused in illicit, including criminal and terrorist, acts. These security threats could be linked directly to maritime security and infrastructures (to deny or ransom a port, for example), or be moved towards other illicit acts.
Roles and responsibilities to map, identify, assess, inspect, retrieve and/or neutralise UXO vary among Member States, allocated to private operators, local and regional governments, national governments, and/or the military that carry out civilian tasks.
Current capabilities on mapping, identifying, assessing, inspecting, retrieving and/or neutralising UXO still largely use human operators, and increased use of automated and/or unmanned systems would be desirable for efficiency and safety reasons.
The proposed project should improve civilian capabilities on:

a)	enabling existing knowledge (mapping and integrating data from historical maps and more recent data, including reports from sea operators); comparative analysis of legislation, roles and responsibilities in Member States;
b)	detecting UXO on and below the marine sediment/seabed, in order to detect also buried objects;
c)	identifying, classifying, assessing (identifying chemical and material aspects; sensing levels of corrosion);
d)	inspecting and handling (grab and manipulate UXO under water, from intact shells to chunks to small parts; collect and recovery);

e)	neutralising and disposing (containment of chemical spill-overs and possible explosions).

Especially for proposing new solutions for the capabilities areas a) to c) described above, proposals should take into account and build on existing information produced and compiled by previous EU projects that carry out regular work on environmental risks of hazardous submerged objects such as UXO35.
Research projects should consider results and recommendations from the European Commission?s 2022 ?Study on underwater unexploded munitions: final report?36.
Research projects should consider, build on and not duplicate previous research or findings of previous operational work, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes projects and/or other EU projects, including those funded by the EU Maritime and Fisheries Fund, by the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP), or by JPI Ocean. Relevant work by civilian national or regional projects37, or by regional organisations (such as, for example, NATO/CMRE Research Centre) should be considered.
For objectives in the capabilities areas d) and e) described above, proposals should focus on the solutions that address the civil needs and challenges of UXOs (not necessarily deriving from mine countermeasures), with regard to civil resources and engaging civil stakeholders.
Indeed the involvement of civilian stakeholders, beyond civilian authorities, such as operators on sea, is strongly encouraged. The project should focus on civilian capability gaps and needs, rather than capabilities that are better addressed by defence instruments and tasks.
Proposed solutions should be compatible or interoperable with legacy and current systems, and propose or allow an interoperability between systems in use by different Member States.
Proposed solutions that would improve energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of current UXO risk mitigation operations (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.
Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): sonars and other sensors; UxVs/AUVs; on- board analytical capabilities for material samples; hydroacoustic profiling; artificial intelligence for detection and classification; wing tows from ships; system of systems architecture.
Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.

HORIZON-CL3-2023-BM-01-03, Beyond the state-of-the-art ?biometrics on the move? for border checks,11/23/2023,RIA,6/29/2023,,,Around 3.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Updated, European-based, knowledge and development on robust biometrics technologies that could be used for recognition (identification and verification) of people crossing external EU borders, demonstrating a clear advancement beyond the current state-of-the-art;
?	Maximisation of travellers? experience and of security reassurances, minimising handling of personal data and maximising accuracy, reliability and throughput of the recognition process;
?	Contribution to improving the operational response capacity of the EBCG at border crossing points and to capabilities that strengthen the Schengen area, by providing security at its external borders that also reassure on maintaining the free movement within its borders.
Scope: Biometrics are one of the most usable and most reliable ways to validate the identity of an individual. Biometrics that are traditionally used in the context of border controls include fingerprints and 2D facial images; other biometrics are also used for identity management outside the European Union, or at national level, such as iris; and further others are used in other applications in the private sector and in consumer market.
As for many other technologies, applications of biometrics to improve capabilities in civil security, such as in the border management or law enforcement sectors, may have higher requirements than applications in the consumer market. This applies to the requirements on reliability, usability, scalability, throughput and strict minimization of risks to personal data protection and fundamental rights (including the elimination or minimisation of any risk of bias or discrimination).
Research should assess and develop the fit-for-purpose border management of biometric identification modalities beyond fingerprints and facial images, and/or innovative modalities of acquisition of those and other biometrics. Proposed projects should particularly investigate biometrics modalities that currently do not offer satisfactory performance (in terms of

accuracy, reliability, usability, minimisation data protection risk and risk of bias etc.) but potentially offer significant advantages over existing solutions in the short or medium term for applications in a border checks context.
Any innovation in biometrics shall imply clear improvements on acquisition, processing and validation, compared to the state-of-the-art, ?on-the-move? (i.e. while the travellers are moving and without cooperation from them), contactless and with stand-off biometric capturing from long-distances (ideally, but not mandatorily, more than 10 meters), and/or of when multiple travellers cross borders, on foot or inside the same vehicle. The solutions should also take into account the different nature and scenarios of BCP operations (e.g. open air conditions, night, time, time constraints, space constraints, etc).
The solutions should comply with the requirements of current and foreseen EU large-scale IT systems on borders and visa (e.g. the Entry/Exit System), as well as with interoperability frameworks between EU large-scale IT systems on borders, visas, asylum and migration, as well as on police and judicial cooperation.
The proposed solutions should comply with data protection by design and by default, meet robust fundamental rights impact assessment frameworks as well as apply privacy-preserving and privacy-enhancement by design solutions. Developed solutions could indeed help reduce the amount of biometric data needed to achieve improved reliability of identification, including by acquiring and using less personal data compared to the state-of-the-art.
The project should also study the stability over time of collected biometrics, and if and how it would be possible to ?re-use? collected biometrics in a secure and privacy-friendly manner, for the same purposes and according to allowed uses, collected biometrics, and avoid collecting the same biometrics multiple times.
The proposed solution(s) should address modular integration with health checks ? such as in the case of pandemics ? as well as checks on people?s temperature. At system-level, emphasis should be given to automated border check for the purpose of guiding travellers on-the-move while performing the seamless biometric acquisition. Systems should also be compatible with policies and measures typically introduced during pandemics (e.g. the use of face-masks and social distancing).
The proposed solutions should include automated decision support systems for the biometric recognition process suggesting to the end-users (border checks operators) which procedure, technology or database can be used without infringing rights of travellers.
The developed solutions need to comply with the Ethics Guidelines on Trustworthy AI (2019)39.
EU border authorities in the consortia should plan to take up the results of the research, assuming the project delivers on its goals and is compatible with applicable legislation, using the financial support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).

Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): 3D facial images, contactless friction-ridge biometrics (i.e. fingerprint, palmprint and finger-knuckle-print), iris recognition from long distances, palm vein, periocular biometrics, novel algorithms embedding artificial intelligence as well as advanced hardware components like sensors, traveller tracking systems for high- quality on-the-move biometric acquisition, safe single wavelength or multispectral light sources (for the illumination of subjects) and document verification subsystems.
Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant recent EU Framework Programmes projects on security research, and projects funded under HORIZON-CL3-2021- BM-01-03: Improved border checks for travel facilitation across external borders and improved experiences for both passengers and border authorities? staff and HORIZON-CL3- 2022-BM-01-02: Enhanced security of, and combating the frauds on, identity management and identity and travel documents.
Proposals should delineate concrete, clear and convincing plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment in operational context of border checks) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.
Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) and of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available; and on the engagement with the Agencies during the implementation of the project. This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should foresee that Frontex and of eu-LISA will observe projects? pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.
The funded projects will likely have the opportunity of exploiting the core capabilities of the ?Border Management Innovation Centre?

HORIZON-CL3-2023-BM-01-04, Interoperability of systems and equipment at tactical level; between equipment and databases; and/or between databases of threats and materials,11/23/2023,IA,6/29/2023,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased interoperability of existing (and foreseeable upcoming) customs control equipment at tactical level, multi-supplier, multi-authority and cross-border;
?	More efficient and quicker availability, for EU customs practitioners, of reference data (such as spectra) on threats and dangerous and/or illicit materials;
?	Building capabilities for a more harmonised European application of customs controls based on risk management and trade facilitation.
Scope: European customs, as all operators and citizens, also work in our digitalised and interconnected world of equipment, systems, and data. On the one hand, this opens opportunities to harness their capacity to facilitate trade while protecting the security and safety of citizens and benefiting the EU?s economy. On the other hand, the proliferation of equipment, system and data, often from different suppliers and in different versions, may also present challenges in terms of interoperability and an efficient management of flows of goods across the external borders of the Custom Union. Furthermore, the strategy of the ?European custom union acting as one? implies that other authorities beyond customs use that same equipment. It also means that equipment, including mobile one, is shared among Member States to increase cooperation and collaboration on checking flows of goods across European borders. Finally, it equally means that standards and technical specifications for customs control equipment are harmonised.
Another challenge for European customs control capabilities is the rapid availability of, and rapidly shared, data references for (new) threats and illicit materials.
All this calls for research and innovation for solutions that prepare and increase the interoperability of customs control equipment and data at ?tactical? level, in terms of multi- authority, cross-border, multi-supplier interoperability as well as linkages among Member States and Commission systems, and the more rapid availability and sharing of libraries of reference data for target substances or materials. There is room for innovation to improve access to updated spectra (or other formats or references) of target substances and materials when they appear; easily make them available to customs? devices; and improve data for libraries.
The solution(s) proposed under this topic should define the requirements and way forward to enable and enhance the interoperability of customs control equipment and of data used in different Member States and/or by different authorities at national level, as well as Commission systems.
The proposed solution(s) should address how to make libraries of data references on target substances and materials more rapidly available and shared with authorities; to update and

share them faster and securely; to enable quicker tackling of illegal substances and materials, either innovating current approaches or designing altogether new approaches for reference libraries.
EU customs authorities should take up the results of the research in the framework of the Customs Union ?acting as one?, with the support of the Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI). The CCEI will enable not only the possibility to establish harmonisation through common standards and technical specifications but will offer access to actively fund equipment across the Member States to fulfil these common standards.
The proposed solution should include privacy enhancing techniques to allow the sharing of tools without the sharing of data beyond what is strictly necessary. Leaking or compromising personal data should be avoided in the transfer of tools or models.
Improving energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of new security technologies for this capability (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.
Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): blockchain/DLT, artificial intelligence; spectroscopy, data fusion.
Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other recent EU Framework Programmes projects on security research.

While the project will mainly focus on enabling capabilities through interoperability and interchangeability, proposals that in the process aim at advancing certain technological components, and integrating them into the solution, are welcome.
Assuming the project delivers on its goals, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research when compatible with applicable legislation using the financial support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).

?	Improve assisted border crossing control systems, coordinated between border, customs and security controls;
?	Allocate more efficiently border check resources, maintaining security while minimising time and hassle for crossings and false positives;
?	Allocate flexibly border check resources, when and where needed, depending on changing needs (for example seasonally, and/or in the case of roll-on-roll-off ferries);
?	Contribute to capabilities that strengthen the Schengen area, by providing security at its external borders that also reassure on maintaining the free movement within its borders.

Scope: Growth of international travel and mobility (which will likely return to, and increase to a level above, the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels), the scarcity of resources, and the need to ease border crossings while maintaining security of the Schengen area, make reliable risk assessments and border checks prioritisation important. Border practitioners in some Member States are assessing feasibility, reliability and acceptability of optimised border controls using risk-based management.
The solution(s) proposed under this topic should allow easier and more flexible allocation and change of resources in border checks, for example to meet seasonal peaks. A possible use case is that of roll-on-roll-off ferries. That situation may generate long queues for border and security checks, while often being seasonal. A proposed solution should help perform border checks, as well improve the speed for detecting threats in vehicles, such as weapons and explosives, without people coming out of vehicles and without slowing down (dis)embarkment off or onto roll-on-roll-off ferries.
In any case, the proposed solution(s) should consider both the travellers and the goods accompanying them.
Higher leveraging of risk management in border crossing practices has the potential to also decrease and minimise the use of personal data and the risk for violating fundamental rights. The project should integrate strong ethical, legal and acceptability assessment to ensure that, on the other hand, the risks of bias (such as on ethnicity or gender) and discrimination of risk mitigation is minimised.
Collaboration with international stakeholders in the field of transport and transport safety in the air, maritime and rail contexts is encouraged.
Should the project deliver on its goal and be compatible with applicable legislation, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research with the support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).
The proposed system should ensure secure data collection, access, encryption, and decision support processes. Full encryption at transit and rest should be ensured, while enabling fuzzy searches on all metrics of the documents? data.
The system should include automated decision support systems that suggest the end-users which process and database/tool can be legally used using a certain technology.
Solutions should be compatible or interoperable with legacy and current systems, and propose or allow an interoperability between systems in use by different Member States.

effects, cross-sector and cross-border analysis, standardised plans, educational and training tools;
?	An all-hazards framework is created to support Member States in ensuring improved concepts and instruments for the anticipation of risks to entities that provide essential services, resulting in an improved preparedness and response against disruptions of key sectors in the EU and enhanced resilience of the EU internal market.
Scope: The EU Security Union Strategy for 2020-2025, Counter-Terrorism Agenda for the EU and the Cyber Security Strategy stress the importance of ensuring resilience in the face of various risks. The livelihoods of European citizens and the good functioning of the internal market depend on the reliable provision of services fundamental for societal or economic activities in many different sectors. Those services often are reliant upon one another, thus disruptions in one sector can generate severe and long-lasting effects on the provision of services in others.
Member States hold the primary responsibility in ensuring that operators who use critical infrastructures to deliver such services (hereafter: ?operators?) comply with applicable rules and have the necessary support to ensure their own resilience and as part of a complex system of interdependencies. On EU-level, there has been a revision of certain legislation aiming at the minimum harmonisation of such rules, such as the [proposals] for a directive on the resilience of critical entities (CER) and the directive on measures for high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS-2). In combination with sectoral EU-legislation and policies on resilience, this provides a comprehensive framework that needs to be put in practice.
?Facilitating strategic cooperation? refers to the necessity for public authorities of the Member States to be able to exchange information, in a secure way, on the risk assessments of their critical entities as well as their resilience. ?Critical entities? is the specific term used in the proposed CER directive to designate those entities that will be identified by the Member States under the directive. Pursuant to the directive, in particular of its articles 1 and 5, the identity of the critical entities will be classified. In the performance of the project, project participants will interact directly with Member States authorities responsible for risk assessment and analysis of the vulnerabilities of their critical entities. Pursuant to the proposed directive, the confidentiality of the critical entities (and of their vulnerabilities) shall be ensured and protected.
Proposals under this topic should support the competent authorities of Member States to identify and develop the most suitable tools, solutions and strategies to ensure the resilience of key sectors and thus facilitate the implementation of [related/ future] EU legislation.
Applicants should focus on delivering solutions that can be used by the competent authorities of EU Member States, to support their task in overseeing the resilience of key sectors in line with relevant EU rules. Such solutions should enhance their ability for cooperation and communication, conducting large-scale risk assessments (including the cross-border dimension), developing best practices for exercises and dedicated complex training modules.

The proposals should address the development of improved concepts and instruments for the anticipation and management of strategic risks, strengthening governance framework and enhancing coordination between different authorities.
It is recommended that proposals develop concrete tools to support all-hazard analysis by integrating domain specific risk assessment and allowing to manage interdependencies phenomena among different sectors and Member States. Possible examples are virtual reality tools, dashboards, complex training and serious gaming modules or other instruments to be used and that currently may not exist on such scale.
Proposals should aim to cover the largest possible number of sectors described in the respective Annexes of the [proposals for a] directive on the resilience of critical entities (CER) and the directive on measures for high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS-2)53.
Participation of at least 3 government authorities, from 3 different EU Member States, responsible for resilience on national level and/ or for overseeing operators is mandatory. The inclusion of associations representing private or public operators in specific sectors, or across sectors on EU- or national level, is encouraged.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

?	Support is provided to the resilience of operators against cyber and non-cyber threats in specific sectors;
?	A reliable state-of-the-art analysis of physical/cyber detection technologies and risk scenarios is created, in the context of an operator in a specific sector in sectors that have not yet been covered by previous research projects;



54	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf

?	Strengthened cooperation against natural or human-made threats and subsequent disruptions of infrastructures in Europe, allowing for operational testing in real scenarios or realistic simulations of scenarios with specific regard to disruptions in a specific sector of critical entities;
?	Improved situational awareness, preparedness and governance by the implementation of effective solutions that enhance detection and anticipated projection of a determined threating situation, as well as implementation of prevention, preparedness/mitigation, response, and recovery types of intervention;
?	Significant reduction of risks and exposures to anomalies or deliberate events on cyber- physical systems, or on complex and critical infrastructures/systems;
?	Enhanced preparedness and response by definition of operational procedures of operators as well as public authorities considering citizen?s behaviour/reaction and societal impact in case of disruption in a specific sector.
Scope: The operational environment in which operators operate has changed significantly in recent years. Security research and innovation related to infrastructure resilience has been following a sectorial approach in order to increase the resilience. This approach to critical infrastructure resilience is needed that as it reflects the current and anticipated future risk landscape, the increasingly tight interdependencies between different sectors, and also the increasingly interdependent relationships between physical and digital infrastructures.
A disruption affecting the service provision by one operator in one sector has the potential to generate cascading effects on service provision in other sectors, and also potentially in other Member States or across the entire EU.
With more and more infrastructure systems being interconnected, a stronger focus on the systemic dimension and complexity of attacks and disruptions by cyber or physical means needs to be applied. As such, not only interdependencies within one type of infrastructure (or closely related types) can be taken into account. The risk landscape is more complex in the recent years, involving natural hazards (in many cases exacerbated by climate change), state- sponsored hybrid actions, terrorism, insider threats, pandemics, and accidents (such as industrial accidents).
Physical disruptions of the activities of operators active in these sectors have possibly serious negative implications for citizens, business, governments, in the environment and endanger the smooth functioning of the internal market. Therefore, operators should be equipped with the best possible means to be able to prevent, resist, absorb and recover from disruptive incidents, no matter if they are caused by natural hazards, accidents, terrorism, insider threats, or public health emergencies.
Another important issue is to have in place efficient cybersecurity measures to block the access to critical infrastructures. A possible project focusing on the protection of critical infrastructures against such threat should consider gaps and vulnerabilities that need to be

identified and overcome (e.g. protection of drinking water supply systems from high chemical levels, nuclear facilities, etc.).
Therefore, the successful proposal, following a sector-based approach and identifying a specific priority sector, should work on how to increase the combined cyber and non-cyber resilience operators. It should do so by orienting itself on sectors that have not been covered in previous research, out of the list of sectors described in the respective Annexes of the of the [proposals for a] directive on the resilience of critical entities (CER) and the directive on measures for high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS-2) and thus contribute to enhancing the overall resilience on EU-level, in line with the EU Security Union Strategy.
The proposal should orient itself on the policy shift from protection towards resilience and thus focus on operators acting in the internal market, rather than only their on physical or digital assets. This includes concepts of wider business continuity, as well as logistics and supply-chains. Proposals should also focus on the development of a more effective resilience plan conception method, which shall support operators to draft their resilience plans according to the provisions of the CER and NIS-2 Directives [proposals]. The resilience plan conception method should include risk analysis, domino effects analysis, cross-sector and cross-border analysis, standardised plans etc. In addition, this method could include measures on adequate protection, measures on prevention, response, mitigation, and recovery from the consequences of incidents, protection of sensitive information and measures that ensure adequate employee security management.
The main practitioners in this topic should come from private or public operators, meaning organisations and enterprises that use critical infrastructure to deliver services, vital for the functioning of society and the internal market. Consortia that will include MS public entities would be considered as an asset. Competent authorities of MS in charge of resilience and/ or overseeing operators in one or more sectors are also encouraged to join the consortia of applicants.
If the infrastructure includes processing of personal data, the proposal should consider to include a risk assessment or privacy impact of individuals and society.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if the consortium deems it relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.

?	Evaluation of the resilience of an urban and peri-urban environment, identification of weaknesses and recommendations for changes to organizational processes;
?	Creation of new tools and cost-efficient security upgrades of urban infrastructures with possibilities of pooling and sharing of complex security systems, taking into account limited budgets of local authorities;

The classical large-scale infrastructures have a long tradition of implementing the principles of Safety-by-design and Security-by-design when planning their assets. However, with more and more infrastructures on the local level becoming vulnerable, security research can support their protection with new approaches in ?Security-by-design?. In view of limited budgets of many local administrations, improved knowledge as well as innovative security upgrades and

processes for existing urban infrastructures equipped with advanced connectivity technologies and cooperative systems could be explored.
EU territories, despite their size and location, suffer from a lack of dedicated EU sovereign and trusted tools in order to enhance the coordination of local first responders and to improve security coverage, such as the preparation of operational staff, field intervention and predictive tools. Even though some complicated tools already exist, it is clear that there is no generic, cost effective and easy to use solutions for local authorities. Therefore, there is a need for creation of new tools that are designed in a simple manner and deployed in an effective way.
Resilient and secure urban planning tools for the development of holistic approaches that network the different organizational levels, sensor and communication levels and data rooms are very pertinent. These tools should assess the resilience of urban and peri urban territories, identify weaknesses and recommend changes to organizational processes, sensors and communication infrastructure. The secure urban and rural living spaces, technical solutions, organizational levels, and data rooms must be more closely linked. There is a clear need for a development of tools for recovery strategies and proactive foresight for urban and peri urban environments. The tactical tools should include modelling of urban centres and rural areas, predictive tools, improved global situational awareness and day-to-day planning and crisis management (e.g., simulation, training).
A minimum of 2 local authorities from 2 at least different Member States are required to join the consortia of applicants. The proposals should include a high level of confidence in data management and sharing, provide solutions on cybersecurity issues and take on board new type of threats. The proposed solutions should suggest trusted shared architectures, trusted data collection, secure computation on the data and management processes, modelling capabilities, hypervisor supporting global situational awareness with open and trusted API?s, trusted data processing engines and, e.g., artificial intelligence tools. If the tools include processing of personal data it should consider to include a risk assessment or privacy impact of individuals and society.
The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting and the participation of one or more relevant local authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. ? to be developed by the project.

Scope: Today?s society is more interconnected than ever before. Telecommunication networks, transport networks, aviation, energy, water grids, finance are the backbone of today?s society. Due to their exceptional complexity and size, infrastructure networks pose a specific challenge when it comes to identifying different risks, either cyber or physical. Especially in the cyber-domain, many intrusions or attacks remain unnoticed or are detected relatively late. Technological developments in areas like machine learning for analytics, user interfaces as well as storage applications have the potential to improve related capabilities.
Modern urban environments and interconnected infrastructures create constantly big amounts of data. In addition, other sources can be exploited to support the identification and analysis of risks to infrastructures. Therefore, research on enhanced risk anticipation through real-time

data analysis has the potential to lead to useful tools to enhance preparedness (contingency plans, scenario-based exercises, allocation of resources, etc.).
Resilience of smart cities is marked by a set of specific requirements taking into account most notably aspects from the integration considering user centred approaches as well as social and ethical aspects of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), AI/ Machine Learning approaches for real-time data analytics, ensuring transparency, sufficient knowledge and their operational challenges in this area.
While the availability of larger amounts of data from different sources offers potential to improve the identification of possible risks to infrastructures, it increases also the demand for fast and resilient analytical tools. There is a need to filter information to identify data that is relevant as an indicator for risks and - given the large number of different forms of cyber- attacks or intrusions - also a need to prioritise and decide according to the degree of danger they present. This implies the need for matching data in the appropriate context and verifying the source with a view of ensuring that only relevant data is analysed, thus avoiding false results. Faster identification and localisation of hazardous agents and contaminants inside the infrastructure networks is a key to allow for quick response, inform and involve citizens and residents as well as avoid large-scale damage of any incident. Such identification capabilities can be deployed as part of the infrastructure and integrate with the systems public authorities use to make sure information is available as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop methods for better cooperation between different actors to ensure a common understanding and interpretation of data and to provide interactive tools for exchange and visualisation for decision support. Cooperation between different public and private actors is essential in this regard.

Scope: Using big data for digital services and scientific research brings about new opportunities and challenges. For example, machine-learning methods process medical and behavioural data in order to find causes and explanations for diseases or health risks. However, a large amount of this data is personal data. Leakage or abuse of this kind of data, potential privacy risks (e.g. attribute disclosure or membership inference) and identity compromises pose threats to individuals, society and economy, which hamper further developing data spaces involving personal data. Likewise, there are similar challenges for the exploitation of non-personal/industrial data assets that may compromise the opportunities

offered by the data economy. Advanced privacy-preserving technologies such as, for example, cryptographic anonymous credentials, homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, and differential privacy have the potential to address these challenges. However, further work is required to ensure and test their applicability in real-world use case scenarios.
The security of any digital service or the access to data is based on secure digital identities. The eID Regulation provides the legal framework on which to build technological solutions that address the user needs concerning their digital identity. With regards to personal data, it is also important to develop self-sovereign identity solutions that give users complete control on their personal data and use.
Proposals should address usability, scalability and reliability of secure and privacy-preserving technologies in supply chain and take integration with existing infrastructures and traditional security measures into account. They should further take into account, whenever needed, the legacy variation in data types and models across different organizations. The proposed solutions should be validated and piloted in realistic, federated data infrastructures such as, for example, European data spaces. They should ensure compliance with data regulations and be GDPR compliant by-design. Open-source solutions are encouraged.

?	Security-by-design concept and resilience to adversarial attacks;
?	Inclusion of context awareness in machine learning in order to boost resiliency.
Scope: Proposals received under this topic will address the security of AI systems, in the line with the following considerations. The availability of very large amounts of data, together with advances in computing capacity, has allowed the development of powerful Artificial Intelligence applications (in particular Machine Learning and Deep Learning). At the same time, concerns have been raised over the security, robustness of the AI algorithms (including AI at the edge) , including the risks of adversarial machine learning and data poisoning. Thus, it is important to promote security-compliant AI algorithms, leading to possible certification schemes in the future.
Proposals should demonstrate awareness of the EU approach on Artificial Intelligence62, such as the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act.

Scope: Software is at the foundation of all digital technologies and, as such, at the core of IT infrastructures, services, and products. Current software development prioritises fast deployment over security, which results in vulnerabilities and unsecure applications. Security engineering, both at the software and hardware levels, must be integrated in their development. Whilst a great portion of the software and hardware used in the EU is developed outside the European Union, it should comply with the security requirements within the EU. The EU should be able to rely on software and hardware that can be verified and audited as to their security. In particular, the potential security implications of using open-source software and hardware, and security auditability in that context, should be further explored. Software is subject to continuous update, so the security posture cannot be assessed once and for all, hence methods and tooling to perform continuous assessments of security are needed. In addition, security and privacy regulations also evolve, having to be factored in compliance approaches.

?	Increasing the maturity of current post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and contribution to further standardisation;
?	Easy-to-use tools for the large-scale implementation of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, based on state of the art standards;
?	Secure and efficient transition from pre- to post-quantum encryption through tools implementing a hybrid approach combining recognised pre-quantum public key algorithms and additional post-quantum algorithms;

?	Demonstrators and good-practice implementations of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms on varied hardware and software platforms;
?	Application-oriented recommendations for the widespread implementation of post- quantum cryptography across the EU.
Scope: The advent of large-scale quantum computers will compromise much of modern cryptography, which is instrumental in ensuring cybersecurity and privacy of the digital transition. Any cryptographic primitive based on the integer factorization and/or the discrete logarithm problems will be vulnerable to large-scale quantum-powered attacks. The digital data/products/systems that derive their security ultimately from the abovementioned primitives will be compromised and must be upgraded - including their replacement when needed- to quantum-resistant cryptography. The massive scale of this foreseen upgrade shows that preparations are needed today in order to widely implement the relevant mitigations in the future. Many companies and governments cannot afford to have their protected communications/data decrypted in the future, even if that future still seems distant. There is a need to advance swiftly in the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.
Post-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms should be deployable in a dynamic manner in order to quickly react to new quantum computer developments. Recommendations for post- quantum cryptography have already been published, but have to be maintained up-to-date, Proposals received under this topic should contribute to developing coordinated European recommendations for the transition to post-quantum cryptography across the EU.

Scope: The COVID-19 pandemic illustrated the specific challenges of health emergencies and the necessity to be prepared not only on a material and physical level but also from a social and societal perspective. Challenges during the pandemic included difficulties of working with protective gear such as insecurities and usage mistakes; additional disadvantages for vulnerable groups among others due to communication issues; and lack of local cooperation and prevention regarding equipment, stocks, and coordination. These challenges were largely due to deficiencies in the inclusion of social sciences in disaster research. The COVID-19 pandemic poses an opportunity to analyse successes and difficulties during a global health crisis and thereby preparing for future health crises.
Currently, different groups are not reached equally by public communication efforts. Risk communication especially fails to contact vulnerable groups. Social inequalities are present in different forms and on different levels. For communication strategies and interventions, it should be considered how they are affected by different groups, localities, and cultural factors. In different crises, different vulnerability factors can be more pronounced and different groups can be more vulnerable. On the other hand, resilience can protect against negative effects of crises. Resilience can be supported on an individual, organisational, or systemic level. All should be considered in preparation for crisis as well as in acute situations.
Information technology and digital data processing are becoming increasingly important in public health issues, including personal data protection and ethics. Processing large datasets and automated analyses can open new possibilities in understanding health and illness on a population level and for deriving prevention strategies. However, the implementation of information technology poses several challenges and research on how to effectively use the results in political decision-making. Data security is another challenge when large amounts of personalized (health) data are processed automatically. Concerns about data security and general scepticism about digital information processing in the population need to be taken seriously and addressed.
Health encompasses several aspects and levels. Human health incorporates both physical and psychological health which are interconnected and mutually dependent. At the same time, humans are embedded in their environment so human and environmental health cannot be approached in isolation from each other. According to the One Health approach, health of humans, animals, and environment are intertwined. This is illustrated by the current health crisis of COVID-19 which is attributed to SARS-CoV-2 jumping over from wild animals to humans. Another illustration of the interconnectedness are health impacts of climate change. These interdependencies make an interdisciplinary approach to health necessary that incorporates all aspects of health and their interconnectedness.

?	Extended networking of training centres in Europe and selected CBRN Centres of Excellence in non-EU countries;
?	Compilation of information of capacities of networked CBRN-E training centres in view of better coordination of training and testing actions in support of research and standard developments;
?	Improved cooperation and development of testing methodologies and protocols for the validation of tools and technologies resulting from research actions (including pre- or co- normative research) and/or proofs of concepts for developing standards, combining societal and technological challenges;
?	Inter-cooperation through an established forum of training centres to synchronize actions for identifying gaps in test and validation techniques, methodologies and protocols.
Scope: In case of a CBRN-E incident, it is of outmost importance that personnel involved in handling the situation, i.e., rescue services and polices, are well educated and trained and that they are using equipment and tools that are reliable with validated capabilities. It can be the difference between a well-functioning management and a disaster. To achieve a more robust and consistent opportunity to practice, test and evaluate CBRN-E tools and technologies (resulting from research actions and/or standard developments) within Europe and beyond, it is necessary to strengthen networking of existing training and testing facilities and centres and to extend it to relevant CBRN Centres of Excellence located in non-EU countries. An assessment of such facilities can identify gaps where training and testing opportunities are lacking but can also be a possibility to highlight weaknesses in that there may be dependencies on one or a few actors. This will indicate what type of facilities are ready to be used for specific training / validation needs and which developments are required to strengthen the testing end exercise capabilities to be better prepared in the event of a CBRN-E

incident. It will also give the existing centres a possibility to cooperate to compare, enhance, develop and extend the range of tests, exercises and training to achieve a robustness that will benefit the whole European CBRN-E community. Along validation / testing actions, training exercises should consider societal aspects (vulnerable groups, human factors) in combination of CBRN technological response in case of an incident. It should be considered whether the Commission stockpiled items, aiming to respond to medical and CBRN emergencies, could be a part of training and validation exercises.
The work would build on the results achieved from past H2020 and ISF actions in this area, focusing on further development of tools, tests and training methods.

HORIZON-CL3-2023-DRS-01-04, Robotics:  Autonomous or semi-autonomous UGV systems to supplement skills for use in hazardous environments,11/23/2023,RIA,6/29/2023,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Broad acceptance of autonomous systems by first responders and affected people in civil protection;
?	Higher safety and security standards for operational forces working in hazardous environments;
?	Get ahead of future shortcomings of trained first responder personnel by increasing first responder efficiency (less personnel do more work in shorter time);
?	Increased ability to conduct on-scene operations remotely without endangering first responders;
?	European robotics industry is strengthened through engagement in the civil protection research as well as an economic and political advantage through building up know-how for innovative technologies;
?	Reduction of false positive redouts from various sensors carried by robots.
Scope: Robotics and automation are key technologies that help increase productivity and efficiency to prevent, prepare, and/or respond to natural and human-made disasters. Demographic change and lifestyle changes, such as shifting several time centre of one?s life, build up lots of pressure, especially on volunteer-based first responder organizations, which need long training to be mission ready. First responders supported by robotics will be able to fulfil more work within a shorter amount of time and with less personnel. In this industry, cheaper, more capable, and more ?exible technologies are accelerating the growth of fully automated production facilities. It is necessary to bring this innovation also into saving lives. Fundamental changes (procedures, tactics and strategies) in the civil protection traditional way of working is needed. Robotic systems with and without autonomous functionalities are not entirely new in disaster relief. But still, there is no continuous and decisive step towards bringing this innovation into the first responders? daily work. In order to be successful in this process, various aspects should be considered.

Firstly, there is a need to identify the fields and domains that will benefit from (autonomous) robotic systems. For a start, there is an urgent need to look into the deployments in hazardous environments or where the danger for first responders and citizens is the highest. What kind of technologies can be replaced with robotic solutions to complete the task more efficiently? What are the situations which cause the most significant danger to human life during a disaster situation? Also, it is essential to look into options where robotic systems might be more effective than humans. Extensive technology inventory is needed. Altogether this first step can be considered as the exhaustive requirements and gaps analyses which is an inevitable step bringing robotics closer to the civil protection.
Secondly, the identified gaps and needs should be the basis for proof-of-concept research and development studies. Proof of concept studies can either focus on autonomous systems or semi- autonomous systems (e.g. optionally manned or tele-operated systems). These solutions enable managers and practitioners to immerse themselves in what is happening on- site from a great distance and make decisions or even actively intervene in what is happening. To this end, new sensing capabilities should be developed to enhance robotic capabilities and provide more information about the hazards in the environment they operate. They should be adapted in a compact system to be mounted on robots. Human-machine interaction technologies that enable an overlapping control of the robotic systems between the artificial Intelligence entity and the operator need to be developed. The interaction between the user and the robotic system has to be intuitive and should work without extended training. Thirdly, first responders' training, preparedness, and mindset should be considered when bringing new technologies into the field. This is necessary in order to reach a required paradigm shift. This is a long-term process and therefore has to be strategical and well planned.
Fourthly, the relevant infrastructure needs to be put in place. Robotic systems should be seen as an integral part of first responder ecosystems and not as a single technology. Further research is needed to define the basic physical and organisational structures and facilities required for the operation of robotic solutions and integration to the current operational infrastructure. Therefore, adapted standard operational procedures have to be developed.
Overarching topics like ethics, legal and societal implications are highly relevant in the robotics context. They form the basis for the societal acceptance of artificial intelligence in control and decision-making. As robotics become a new resource for the application in hazardous environments (but not only), their acceptance has to be ensured from the perspectives of emergency services, just as the people to be rescued.
In summary, the scope of this topic is not only to develop new robotic solutions for specific tasks but address it more holistically considering also the surrounding environment and factors that impact civil protection on a larger scale (urbanisation, ageing, climate change, increased complexity in the area of critical infrastructure protection etc.). There are many research and engineering challenges that need to be addressed in the framework of this topic. First responders play a vital role in ensuring that the robotics solutions are based on the needs and are valuable assets for the civil protection ecosystem.

Scope: Supplying relief items to various demand spots in disaster-prone areas is a critical task due to last-kilometer logistics problems that hamper the process of and efficient transportation of first responders and their equipment. Blocked roads, heavy terrain and bad weather conditions are factors that are faced by first and second responders (e.g. fire brigade, emergency medical services) in the immediate response to disasters. Innovative technologies (e.g. drones, AI, sensors etc.) are considered to support emergency workers in overcoming the aforementioned challenges related to relief items delivery and can provide ability to obtain critical information remotely about the extent, perimeter, or interior of the incident as well as conduct on-scene operations remotely without endangering responders.

HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-01," Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of chemical, biological and radiological threats to agricultural production, forestry and to food processing, distribution and consumption",11/20/2024,RIA,6/27/2024,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Increase EU capabilities to assess risks, detect, alert, mitigate and respond to food intentional contamination from CBRN agents, through the entire food chain/s (agro- production, food industry, transporting, retail and HO.RE.CA., public catering);
?	Increase the understanding on food terrorism threats and on food chain vulnerabilities to intentional and accidental contaminations;
?	Raise awareness among food companies and authorities to CBRN threats arising from malicious use of hazardous agents that pose danger to public health. This should be done under the premises of food as a critical infrastructure and risks pertaining therein;
?	In addition to raising awareness, proposals should develop possible preparedness and response plans for national authorities and the private sector.
Scope: Plant and animal health is of global importance for sustainable agriculture and competitive agriculture and forestry, as well as for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. Globally, between 10 and 28 percent of crop production is lost  to pests and

contamination of food and feed by mycotoxins can severely threaten the health of humans and livestock. The International Year of Plant Health (IYPH) 2020, established by the United Nations, raised public and political awareness of the importance of plant health and a recent study (IPPC, 2021) calls the attention of policy makers to the main effects of climate change on plant health, helping governments and the international community addressing plant health challenges. Also, the food chain, from harvest of agricultural products, throughout processing, distribution and until consumption can be challenged by several (hybrid) threats, which are increasingly taking non-conventional forms and possibly targeting the agriculture and food chain with severe consequences.
The Word Health Organisation identified intentional agriculture attack with biological weapons and food contamination as one of the main global public health threats of the 21st century. The potential for terrorist attacks or other criminal actions against agri-food targets is increasingly recognised as a threat to international security. The population's health could be jeopardised by the manipulation of communicable diseases or the contamination of food, soil, air and drinking water by CBRN agents. These risks have been studied and documented by a Network of excellence (Plant and Food Biosecurity) funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (PLANTFOODSEC).
In 2017, the ENVI Committee (Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the EU Parliament) as defined Food Defence as ?the protection of food from intentional contamination or adulteration by biological, chemical, physical or radiological agents. It includes measures regarding prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery form intentional acts of food contamination?. The potential impact on human health of deliberate sabotage of agricultural crops, seed or food can be estimated by extrapolation from the many documented examples of unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease.
Current EU capabilities to detect and respond to agro-terrorism and bio-criminal acts are dispersed across different national practitioners, normally handled by regional or national bodies and are very limited in terms of coordination. Different countries have different governmental authorities for agricultural and food domains, different collaborative networks, different border controls, different inspection bodies and different regulatory references and reporting mechanisms as well as different investigative bodies in the case of suspected food crime. The EU institutions have to start to consider the agri-food chain as a critical infrastructure which can suffer from attacks and which need to be protected. The most effective way to accomplish this goal is through international cooperation by a multi-sectorial approach combing different expertise, such as from law enforcement, the food sector and health emergency services.
The main challenge is to increase the resilience of European agricultural production, food processing and distribution chain in case of sudden external shocks. Agriculture and food chains will be included as an important dimension to be analysed in the context of protection of European critical entities in case of emergencies. It is also crucial to address the interrelations between the Food chain shocks and different types of critical entities with the objective of developing tools and  methods  to minimize cascading  effects  and  allow rapid

recovery of service performance levels after incidents. In the new context also the interaction with climate change, global trade and internet trade (spreading often plant material not controlled at all and of low quality) need to be taken into consideration. Artificial intelligence provides new tools for better coping with many of the most important challenges.
In this context, research should address agri-food systems shocks, with focus on the increasing effects of climate change and global trade (and their interaction) on pest outbreaks and spread, food commodity shocks, due to external challenges, urban Food supply chains interruption, organised agri-food terrorism attacks, and application of cyber security to the agri-food systems.

?	Enhanced links between scientific community and first and second responders promoting user-targeted research and faster transfer of science results into best practices;
?	Enhanced adoption of novel technologies such as advanced Earth Observation capabilities and capabilities such as those from Earth Observation space technologies into prevention and management practices and tools;

?	Improved methods for cross-border and cross-sectoral knowledge transfer about risk, vulnerability, exposure, and monitoring methods;
?	Development of common technical standards of alert and impact forecasting systems that cope more efficiently with transboundary emergencies and for GIS-based information systems dealing with high-impact weather / climatic and geological disasters management during emergencies;
?	Identification of needs and opportunities for transferring advanced scientific results into enhancement in disaster logistics and responses, including tailor-made education and training programmes for emergency management teams.
Scope: Europe is confronted with increasingly intense and sometimes unexpected consequences of natural disasters ranging from floods and heavy rain events to droughts and large-scale forest fires even in hitherto not affected regions, as well as other geohazards such as volcanic eruptions and landslides. To respond to these emerging challenges an integrated

transnational emergency management is needed efficiently linking systems available at the European level such as, for example, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, with national, regional or local systems. Furthermore, an evaluation of applied disaster risk reduction methods is required, in particular alert and impact forecasting systems, to identify potential for improvement and constant innovation.
Knowledge transfer (cross-border and cross-sectoral) about natural hazards-related risks and emergency management is essential to increase the resilience of societies. A vital dialogue and exchange of good practice examples among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policymakers and local communities is needed. In particular, the level of awareness of EU citizens for local risks can be increased by new approaches to visualise risks, vulnerability and exposure through e.g. impact forecasting data and mapping including satellite data and information. Emergency management plays a crucial role in this regard, taking into account the ongoing urbanization and economic growth, which put a lot of pressure on areas such as floodplains and their ability to absorb and store water.
Currently, there are no harmonised / standardised European methods for identifying vulnerability and exposure on the basis of which alert and impact forecasting systems are established, allowing this information to be used by civil protection authorities in a timely manner to improve disaster preparedness, communication to local authorities and population, evaluation logistics etc. Recent flash floods in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg in July 2021 have shown that this lack of protocols hampered the efficient implementation of early warning and preparedness actions prior to the disaster event.
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme. Proposals should include a work package, means and resources for coordination with complementary projects funded under the Science for Society element of the ESA FutureEO programme. The projects(s) should establish a close coordination and collaboration with the relevant ESA relevant actions and projects (https://eo4society.esa.int).
In this context it is important to remind that standardisation should support operations and policy-making to supplement it but should by no means substitute it. While standardisation of technology may be more straightforward, the right balance does especially have to be sought for processes. The action should ensure close synergies with standardisation activities on European and international level.

?	Development of a holistic vision of crisis management after telluric (e.g. volcanic, seismic, tsunami, landslide) or extreme climate events (e.g. floods, storms, storm surges, fires, droughts) producing impacts on critical assets (e.g. infrastructures, industries) and creation of new management framework for handling NaTech crises;

?	Enhanced existing crisis management tools to develop a common platform (shared among public and private operators) allowing cross-border exchanges and decision- making, while respecting legal frameworks and responsibilities;
?	Demonstrated operational protocols and development of standard operating procedures able to respond to NaTech crises in cross-border configurations, including comprehensive risk modelling of worst-case scenarios taking into account cascading effects and future impacts of climate change, and taking into consideration spatial information and data;
?	Improvement of our understanding and capabilities to identify and mitigate risks associated with interdependencies across infrastructures and other human (social and economic) systems.
Scope: The confluence of incidents in recent years has brought renewed concerns over our systemic resilience to external shocks arising from natural-technological (NaTech) disasters. This is particularly acute in the event of disruption in the transport, power, water supply and communication sectors in highly populated and industrialised areas, or when such events raise the likelihood of cascading effects with severe impacts on communities and the economy that are hard or impossible to predict. The main focus on NaTech risks lies on a thorough understanding of the vulnerability of industrial sites and critical infrastructure, and the potential impact natural hazards can have on such technological resources. This entails the identification of both physical (safety of building facilities and structures) and operational vulnerabilities, often addressing multi-hazard conditions. Innovative methods are required for analysing worst-case scenarios, and informing decision-makers about the crosscutting and shared responses to different crises given available resources.
Research involving multiple fields of expertise, including spatial information (to be specified), is also required to improve hi-tech capacities for operational response systems to better cope with natural and/or technological disasters occurring in Europe (and in overseas territories) in an integrated manner. This will rely on a knowledge sharing among natural and technological risks communities to develop a holistic vision for an integrated operational crisis management of NaTech disasters.
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme. Proposals should include a work package, means and resources for coordination with complementary projects funded under the ESA FutureEO initiative.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research/innovation activities.

In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The action should take due consideration to EU policies, in particular the SevesoIII and CER Directives, and ensure close synergies with international conventions such as the Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents (TEIA) / Implementation of natural hazard-triggered technological accident principles, and the Sendai Framework for Action",
HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-04, Cost-effective sustainable technologies and crisis management strategies for RN large-scale protection of population and infrastructures after a nuclear blast or nuclear facility incident,11/20/2024,RIA,6/27/2024,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects? results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:
?	Based on existing national practices, improved understanding of the radioactive fallout and methodology regarding robust and rapid monitoring of dose rate and nuclide specific determination with purpose of facilitating safe evacuation after a nuclear or radiological event;
?	Improved tools and methods for risk assessment following a nuclear or radiological event and optimized actions after a disaster that are based on risk analysis rather than probabilities
?	Identification of the relevant range of different protective measures, including medical countermeasures, needed after a RN disaster, and improved protection of population and infrastructures through better analysis of sensor data resulting in adequate protective actions;
?	Improved understanding of contamination and decontamination of population and infrastructure, and improved rapid procedures for decontamination of individuals after a RN-incident;
?	Recommendations on integration of improved technologies and assessment methodologies in the RN crisis managements systems.
Scope: A nuclear explosion in any EU member country (or in the European neighbourhood) would lead to disastrous effects for numerous EU citizens and residents. For example, the initial effects from a nuclear explosion in a city will lead to, besides numerous dead and severely injured citizens, destroyed infrastructure. The radioactive plume containing particulate matter may damage ventilation systems and fallout will generate high dose rates. Criticality or other incidents at nuclear power plants and nuclear-powered vessels may occur because of direct attack, sabotage, collateral damage, accidents, loss of infrastructure services such as power and/or water supply or lack of necessary skilled personnel on site.
Research on large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion need to be undertaken both separately as well as in a RN-perspective. Research activities aimed at updating EU?s possibilities for large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion would benefit from being carried out in close cooperation with other EU-members. Research activities should also pertain to improved understanding of the radioactive fallout and assessment of dose rates to the population following a nuclear explosion in order to enable use of cost-effective sustainable technologies in protection of population and infrastructures.
In a situation after a RN-incident the time consuming and laborious decontamination procedures for the population must be reduced to a minimum. Therefore, the possibility to identifying the need for decontamination, and above all to assess that there is no need for

decontamination would be beneficial as well as the possibility to enter a shelter or other protected area in a safe way.
Protective measures in the aftermath of a RN disaster may vary depending on situations. Such measures should be based on evaluated risks rather than probabilities. Starting with sensor- as well as other available data, measures could be optimized from a risk-cost point-of-view resulting in cost-effectiveness.
Based on measurement data, appropriate protective actions could be decided upon. If a risk analysis results in a low risk, a lower level of mitigating measures might be needed resulting in lower costs. Then resources can be used in other areas where they are more needed, leading to an overall optimized protection.
Protective actions should be based on risk modelling. Such modelling is based on available knowledge of different input quantities resulting in a probability distribution, from which the risk can be calculated applying a consequence function.
New technologies should be compatible with RN crisis management systems, strategies for crisis communication and take into account relevant societal and human factors, such as vulnerable group and cultural and linguistic diversities. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The action should take due consideration to EU policies, in particular the SevesoIII and CER Directives.

?	Facilitated access to civil security market for small and medium innovators and enhanced links between suppliers and public buyers;
?	Improved cooperation between public buyers and small supply market actors for a swifter uptake of innovation in response to short to mid-term needs;
?	Stronger partnerships between small and medium EU security industry and technology actors to ensure the sustainability of the EU innovation capacity in the civil security domain and increase technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas.
Scope: Europe?s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.
However, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red-tape in public contracts, access to new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.
Knowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users.
Applicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:
?	Focus on mature technological solutions addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme.
?	Not overlapping with the scope of the topics included in the other destinations of this work programme.
?	Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries.
?	Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations.
?	Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security.

The involvement of big industries in the projects should not focus on technology development but on supporting the SMEs in bringing their innovations to the market. Examples of activities include but are not limited to, acting as first buyer/integrator of the developed technologies, assimilating market requirements, facilitating access to additional funding, approaching potential public buyers, assess competitive landscape, supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation), assist in IP management and exploitation, provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc. In the same fashion, the participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.
It is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role. Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified.
The projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.

In this call, projects should address the areas of Border Management, INFRA, Disaster Resilience, Fighting Crime and Terrorism. Some examples of domains that could be addressed under the BM area are (indicative and non-exhaustive): facilitated border checks; secure documents and identity management for border crossings; border surveillance; detection of drugs, explosives, CBRN, weapons and/or other dangerous materials in customs environment; detection of stolen, smuggled, illicit or illegal goods (cigarettes, art, cultural goods, wildlife) in a customs environment. Some examples of domains that could be addressed under the INFRA area are: (indicative and non-exhaustive): physical access control, autonomous systems used for infrastructure protection, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance of environments and activities.. Some examples of domains that could be addressed under the DRS area are (indicative and non-exhaustive): data and satellite/remote sensing information exploitation, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance for disaster prevention. Some example of domains that could be addressed under the FCT area are: (indicative and non-exhaustive): mobile forensics; deepfake detection; detection of counterfeiting (fake items, fake currency bills) or of falsified/forged documents (passports, ID cards); detection and countering of advanced forms of malware, as well as non-cash payment frauds and other cyber-scams.
Only one project per area will be funded, with the total number of funded projects being three. The area excluded will be the one whose project proposal receives the lowest marking compared to the other three areas.
In this call, projects should address the EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme.

?	All participating public buyers commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular the principles of data protection by design and by default;
?	The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2021) 4320, will be duly taken into account, in particular those measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start- ups and innovative SMEs.
Applicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:

?	A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalise the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input resulting from the previous CSA projects, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.
?	Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;
?	Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.
?	Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.
The applicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.

Remanufacturing aims to retain the usefulness of both products and components and is an essential step in achieving full industrial circularity without implying deterioration of the product.
This calls for both remanufacturing technologies at the factory level and their integration into circular value chains, including the streamlining data to support remanufacturing. Remanufacturing should not be focused only on the reuse of raw materials but should be aimed at reusing and upscaling components, valorising them and retaining or upgrading their functionality. Components, products and/or functions can be updated with new technology and improved beyond their initial functionality. Ultimately, remanufacturing is indirectly expected to reduce the level of resource consumption and hence also the level of CO2- intensity of components.
Proposals should address technologies within specific industrial sectors or across industrial sectors:
?	Develop cutting-edge remanufacturing approaches (design, technologies, business cases) and their integration into value chains;
?	Demonstrate remanufacturing processes that retain components functionality in at least three user cases;

?	The introduction of traceability aspects, quality control and a regulatory validation need to be considered;
?	Repurposing of components into a variety of industrial sectors. Introduce flexible production concepts, advanced machinery, smart mechatronics, interactive and collaborative machines, robots and systems enabling efficient factory operation and reconfiguration;
?	Consider operational and economic viability while also the environmental impact of the proposed approach.
A human-centric approach to remanufacturing should be integrated, with appropriate contributions from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH); as part of this, a strategy for skills development should be included, associating social partners where relevant. This may include augmenting technologies and skills to strengthen the capabilities of the European workforce. A close collaboration with EIT Manufacturing is encouraged, in particular on the development of skills.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.
Proposals should take the relevant EU-regulatory framework into account such as the Ecodesign Directive and the forthcoming Sustainable Product Framework (SPI)21.
Proposals should take into account any relevant international standards (such as the Asset Administration Shell) and activities supported under the Digital Europe programme, e.g. in the area of Manufacturing Data Spaces and the Digital Product Passport initiative.
Research must build on existing standards or contribute to future standardisation. Interoperability for data sharing must be addressed, leveraging on existing ontologies and metadata and though the implementation of the FAIR data principles.22
Where relevant, proposals should contribute to standardisation of relevant technologies.

All projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes.

?	Availability of reliable models, simulators, digital twins, decision making and planning technologies for specific value networks, providing timely scoreboard views and enabling a better understanding of the impact of unforeseen events on manufacturing and industrial production.
?	Availability of technologies to swiftly adapt logistics and production to varying external conditions, improving the resilience of the industrial systems and value chains, and the sustainability of the entire production process.
?	Smart manufacturing networks that are resilient and capable of self-adaptation in response to external threats.
Scope: Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) is a distributed system of production in which resources (including data and software) are offered as services, allowing manufacturers to access distributed providers to implement their manufacturing processes. This topic approaches MaaS from the value network perspective, aiming at exploiting the intrinsic flexibility and resilience provided by the possibility to use distributed and programmable resources on demand, under real-world conditions characterised by high volatility of the supply, the market requirements and the external constraints.

Proposals should develop:

?	Realistic actionable models of value chains, which allow humans to react timely and better understand the impact of external events on the industrial system, and to propose simulations and scenarios that will appropriately respond to those events and optimise industrial production.
?	Solutions that make use of the flexibility of the manufacturing ecosystem to respond to external events, enabling trusted cross organisation real-time data integration / exchange based on standards, and supporting the partial automation of the processes from the confirmation of the order up to the delivery of the product.
Models and simulations should be developed from a human-centred perspective, and lead to instructions for automated manufacturing and re-manufacturing facilities that can implement the retained scenarios and adapt production processes, stock levels and any other variables of the manufacturing and logistic flow, optimising production in terms of resilience, agility. The potential of a circular approach to address resilience should be considered.
Resiliency to failures should be taken into account, resulting in the capability to guarantee useful outputs and reliable production even under non-optimal conditions. Multidisciplinary research activities should address the way to develop robust models on the basis of uncertain and incomplete data, and to translate those models into practically usable digital twins, which can produce actionable information and instructions.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination, and demonstrate their results through at least two realistic use cases.
The results will contribute to making Manufacturing as a Service technically and economically viable, and are expected to improve to both the competitiveness of industry and the circularity and sustainability of the production/logistic processes. Proposals should explain how the proposed approach contributes to these objectives through measurable targets.

while enhancing their global competitiveness. Modelling capacity and scenarios are needed to chart the pathways towards climate neutrality. Projects outcomes will enable the achievement of the objectives of Processes4Planet partnership by contributing to new framework conditions to generate a market for climate neutral and circular solutions (related P4Planet operational objective 10). They will support EU climate ambitions and, following the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on climate mitigation recommendations, 29 allow for actions throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, including energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Development of a model, enhancement of existing modelling tools 30 towards understanding the pathways for industry, and Energy Intensive Industries in particular, to contribute to EU?s climate neutrality;
?	Modelling of scenarios of possible pathways of how industry, and Energy Intensive Industries in particular, can become climate neutral according to the following five dimensions: (1) their energy demand and use and energy efficiency, (2) their emissions including process emissions; (3) in use of raw materials, chemicals and water (e.g. via increasing the use of circular approaches and material substitution, also in view of ensuring affordability of industrial products); (4) their production of consumer goods/equipment/construction products (e.g. looking at sustainability of products and embedded carbon ? a preliminary approach only); (5) possibility of replacing fossil carbon in materials by more sustainable streams (e.g. recycled carbon from industrial emissions, from waste, sourced from sustainable biomass or directly from the atmosphere31);

?	Enhance the knowledge about climate neutrality pathways for industry and academia as the resulting modelling capacity (model code) and input data should be fully transparent and published under an open-source licencing.
Scope:

Development of the model

Currently the modelling tools to represent EU industry?s pathways to climate neutrality are not fully developed. The new modelling capacity should cover historical development starting in1990 and projections up to 2070 and this for the European Union and Associated Countries altogether and each Member State/country separately as well as for European Economic Area according to the five dimensions outlined in the expected outcomes. Considering that materials, chemicals and goods are sourced and traded globally, or at least regionally, global sourcing and trade has to be captured with relevant granularity and based on exogenous assumptions and/or links with global trade models;. Considering that these industries link with other sectors of the economy, innovative ways have to be found to integrate such capacity in a fully consistent energy system picture and to link it with broader macro- economic developments (notably as far as demand for industrial products is concerned) and meta-trends such as digitalisation.
The proposals should be built in a modular manner and progressively lead to the development of an integrated modelling capacity allowing to capture the economics and behavioural aspects of demand, production and trade of materials, as well as techno-economic trajectories of the industrial sectors identified above. That would include (but not necessarily limited to) concepts from system dynamics modelling (for materials flows and stocks), techno-economic modelling (for the economics of production costs, elasticity of demand or trade effects), macro-economic modelling (socio-economics impacts), as well as agent-based modelling (choices of materials or technologies). The proposal should produce first results available for review by the project midterm.
The proposals as a part of its validation and stakeholders? involvement will enable to participate in peer-review processes, scientific conferences and publish in scientific journals and create possibilities for a feedback loop from stakeholders. The modelling capacity should be continuously developed based on the feedback from stakeholders.
Modelling of scenarios

Secondly, the proposals should deploy this new modelling capacity to explore, through the development of several ?what if? scenarios, capturing all dimensions mapped above in a consistent way. The scenarios produced with the model should be contrasted but internally consistent in their policy and economic contexts, presenting different pathways for climate neutrality transition in terms of energy needs, addressing the process emissions as well needs and supply of material and technological options to produce the materials in needed quantities. In addition, a preliminary approach for tracing the carbon embedded in products and replacing fossil carbon in materials should be explored.

Proposals should seek cooperation and give input to the Processes4Planet partnership Advisory Committee panels,33 i.e., ?Impact Panel? and as social innovation is concerned, the ?Feedback Panel?.
Proposals should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and comparative tools e.g., the Energy and Industry Geography Lab of the Joint Research Centre.

?	Use industrial symbiosis and cross-sectorial cooperation to pave the way for achieving the EU Green Deal and ?Fit for 55? package objectives: providing recommendations for optimized regional framework conditions by highlighting barriers and suitable innovation-oriented policies.
The targets above are meant to be achieved collectively by the region/area where the demonstration is located, not only by consortium members.
Scope: An industrial symbiosis, near commercial scale demonstrator, hub should integrate infrastructures (e.g., industrial waste, by-product and water management infrastructure, fluid flow networks, digital infrastructure), and energy networks and grids (e.g., smart operations scheduling, district heat integration, digital power plant including distributed generation, seasonal storage, biomass, and heat pumps integration). Industries involved should boost: their resource efficiency, heat recovery, integration of e renewable energies, use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, and/or support the implementation of CCU locally or prepare for CCS logistics.

This should balance the overall energy consumption with efficiency gains for the Hub for Circularity of at least 10%, including utilisation through cascading heat recovery, smart grid, and digitalised power plants. Optional: in addition, apply or enlarge the use of CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) to the existing local industries; the sustainability gains in energy use should be detailed;
?	Plan in detail the replication and adaption of the concept, including the simulation and the business case and exploitation strategy of the First of a Kind hubs, in two to three alternative locations in close cooperation with the relevant local actors;
?	Consider when applicable the co-development of industrial decarbonization strategies with heat-nets, i.e., based on a socio-economic optimum in the cascading re-use of waste heat and the supply low temperature process heat to the surrounding ecosystem;
?	Use established reporting methodologies for the assessment of industrial symbiosis activities and exchanges including Symbiosis Readiness Levels (SRLs) and best practices established by the H4C European Community of Practice (ECoP). In addition, interact with the ECoP for support, best practice and knowledge exchange on technological and non-technological issue;
?	Include a plan to extend the hub to additional parties who also should benefit and multiply the local/regional synergies in the co-implementation of the identified innovations and solutions within the next five years;

?	Maximise the recovery of substances and energy present in the wastewater streams;
?	Demonstrate contribution to EU climate neutrality goal.
Scope: Wastewater discharge from industry has decreased over decades. This is a consequence of increased regulation (e.g., Industrial Emissions Directive, IED; the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, E-PRTR), improvements in treatment and the implementation of best available techniques. Amongst process industries, pulp and paper, steel and chemicals have high wastewater discharges. The Processes4Planet target is to demonstrate the potential for 90% of wastewater reuse by 2030. A breakthrough in wastewater reduction could be envisaged, by combining existing technologies and novel water treatment technologies and reuse with process intensification, energy recovery and excess heat use e.g., integrated processes with separation systems will reduce water and energy consumption and the amount of final industrial wastewater produced. In addition, industrial waste waters often contain signi?cant amounts of valuable solutes (e.g., organic matter, salts, phosphates, etc.) which are not optimally valorised.
The proposals should:

?	Combine existing and novel water treatment technologies and re-use with process intensification;
?	Use in combination smart monitoring technologies including affordable long lasting and reliable sensors and AI driven devices, integrated system risk management models and decision support tools and technologies for water re-use in process industries;
?	Seek to integrate advanced digital tools for the optimisation of their process, such as Digital twins;
?	Propose new technologies for recovering valuable solutes present in wastewater (metals, organic compounds, etc.) and for eliminating hazardous substances (e.g., micro and nano particles, toxic substances).
The proposals should include energy efficiency, techno-economic and life-cycle assessments considering the overall process. In order to maximize impact, technologies in the proposals should not be focused on one sector, but the proposed solution should be applicable in

different types of industries; elements related to the replicability and scalability of the technology should be provided. Proposals are encouraged to consider outcomes from the Horizon 2020 topic CE-SPIRE-07-2020: Preserving fresh water: recycling industrial waters industry.

Scope: Currently only 12% of the material resources used in the European process industry are recycled and recovered materials and these are mostly down cycled to less valuable products. To move towards a truly circular and sustainable process industry that uses its resources consciously, and without landfilling, breakthrough innovations aiming at upcycling large amounts of secondary resources are needed. The focus of this topic is the upcycling of secondary resources that must lead to the same quality and diversity of products as those obtained when using primary resources. The innovation needed will depend on the addressed waste category. However, even if the upcycling technologies may be sector specific, the cross-sectorial elements are important and should deserve due attention.
Proposals are expected to address the following aspects:

?	Considering the upgrading of secondary resources, when relevant, which may include the development of better separation and sorting technologies and digitalisation;
?	Ensure consistent quality and safety of recyclates and their suitability for the upcycling process itself;
?	If relevant, detection and removal additives in the secondary resources stream;
?	Take due account of logistic aspects such as production planning, risk assessment and management or zero defect at supply chain level;
?	The innovative upcycling of the secondary raw materials should be demonstrated through at least two realistic use cases that must lead to the same quality and diversity of products as those obtained when using primary resources, with demonstrable economic return, developed in closed cooperation between recyclers, process industry, users and technology providers;
?	Successful upcycling relies on advanced monitoring and sensing in the process industries and value chains, and on an improved data completeness, accuracy and interoperability between the process and the recycling companies. Upcycling may create new business opportunities and models. These are aspects that should be duly considered.
Proposals should include energy efficiency techno-economic and life-cycle assessment considerations of the overall process.
Proposals should actively pursue the involvement of all the actors in the value chain from the process industry to formulators, recyclers, public authorities, and standardisation actors.
Research must build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation. Where relevant interoperability for data sharing should be addressed.

site. Proposed solutions should consider also the supply chain to  strongly reduce the environmental footprint of the steel melting process;
?	Enhance the use of iron-bearing feedstock intermediate products with variable content of carbon and variable metallisation, including low-value iron-based sources. (e.g., DRI, recovered by-products) in melting processes.
OR

Projects related to the above point 2 are expected to contribute to one or more of the following outcomes:
?	Use advanced information and communication technology (ICT) to achieve process and energy integration and optimisation of the efficiency of steelmaking and downstream processing (heating and treatment furnaces) in steel plants;

?	Enhance production and energy management of integrated plants with mixed technology routes (e.g. blast furnace?basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF), direct reduction-electric arc furnace (DR-EAF)), to drastically reduce the consumption of coal and the CO2 emissions.
Scope: Proposals should aim at one of the following two aspects, corresponding respectively to the points 1) and 2) outlined under the expected outcomes section:
1. Proposals should address novel and adapted low-CO2 emission technologies for pre- treatment, pre-heating, and melting of iron-bearing feedstock materials with variable content of carbon and variable metallisation including, among others, low-value iron- based sources (i.e., >5% of acidic gangue), or dust and sludge from de-dusting systems. The focus is on the three technological routes of blast furnace?basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF), electric arc furnace (EAF), and direct reduced iron / hot briquetted iron form (DRI / HBI) including the refining and casting processes.
Multidisciplinary research activities should address one or more of the following:

?	Adding variable percentages of steel scrap and/or a wide range of iron-bearing feed materials with variable content of carbon and variable metallisation to the melting process, including low-value iron-based sources (i.e., >5% of acidic gangue and/or residue) without prejudice to the yield of the metallic charge;

?	Adaptations on existing melting processes to replace the traditional use of carbon and hydrocarbons (e.g., for re-carburisation of the liquid, for promoting slag foaming or charge heating) with climate-neutral sources and/or hydrogen;
?	Reduction of the specific consumption of the melting step to achieve a low carbon process by optimisation of energy inputs (electrical vs. chemical) depending on the charge mix (scrap, DRI, HBI, pig iron, low-value iron-based sources) and/or by pre- heating of the iron-bearing feed materials;

?	New sensors and tools for real-time management inside the melting process such as liquid metal and slag temperature and composition and/or reliable energy forecasting to optimal setup and process control.
OR

1.   Proposals should aim at the reduction of fossil fuel and reductant used in both BF-BOF and EAF / DR-EAF steel production and, in turn, curtailing CO2 emissions, using process technologies for gas injection e.g., for BFs, DR plants, but also for EAFs. New control techniques will also have to be developed considering process needs, safety issues, and economic aspects. Gas injection options have the potential for very low CO2 emissions but need intermediate steps before being ready for full industrial deployment (e.g., injection of high percentages of hydrogen in BF and EAF). To achieve the objectives, it could be relevant to consider technology improvement along with developing appropriate business models.
Multidisciplinary research activities should address one or more of the following:

?	Process integration through injection of metallurgical gases or biogas or O2 and H2 (H2- rich gases or pure H2) into metallurgical reactors (e.g. BF, DR, or EAF) to minimise the need for fossil carbon, including new developments regarding the related process technology and control technology;
?	Utilisation and recycling of gases as substitutes in existing steel processes such as, but not limited to, coking plant, sinter plant, BF, DR, BOF, EAF;
?	Consider techniques and tools, which support the immediate decrease of the carbon footprint on the industrial level, with measures such as, but not limited to, involve the production cycle, the energy, and materials supplied;

?	Adapt gas handling and distribution to new gas properties and amounts and consider process needs, safety issues, and economic aspects;
?	Integrate new measuring technologies and/or digital tools for monitoring and control inside the novel architectures of ICT covering the processes considered (existing and new processes), conditions and resources; the extensive use of Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) approaches should allow the easy and fast integration of the new measurement techniques into the set of data streams to be monitored and offline / online used for process setup and control and knowledge extraction;
?	Provide concepts addressing the re-optimisation of the process integration in future integrated steelworks based on clean steel production technologies and considering the stepwise transition of production lines from current conventional iron and steelmaking to future low carbon technologies including relevant intermediate states with mixed production chains.

HORIZON-CL4-2023-TWIN-TRANSITION-01-45," Circular economy solutions for the valorisation of low-quality scrap streams, materials recirculation with high recycling rate, and residue valorisation for long term goal towards zero waste (Clean Steel Partnership) (RIA)",4/20/2023,RIA,12/1/2022,,,3.00 to 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to one or more of the following outcomes:

?	Implementation of highly efficient technologies for recovering metal (iron and non- ferrous metals) and mineral fractions from in-plant steelmaking residues. The recovery technology should condition the composition and properties of the residue such as, but not limited to, slag, sludge, scale, filter dust, sinter waste produced by blast furnace / basic oxygen furnace (BF / BOF) and electric arc furnace (EAF) routes, but also by next- generation iron and steelmaking such as, but not limited to, the direct reduction / electric arc furnace (DR / EAF) pathway including the melting and reduction of low-grade iron ore. Two possible ways are envisioned: the first one is based on cooling and mechanical steps, such as, but not limited to, wet or dry granulation followed by phase separation; the second one relies on dedicated processes to enable a direct recycling of residues in existing production processes or in standalone pyro-metallurgic melting and reduction or hydrometallurgical / biohydrometallurgical units. Such knowledge and results should support the valorisation of residues in the present value chain and/or in innovative applications. If appropriate, residues could be chemically and structurally characterised at micro-scale level via characterisation (also multi-modal) performed at analytical research infrastructures, which would allow obtaining relevant statistical information;
?	Describe and/or modify the composition and properties of residues such as, but not limited to, slags and/or sludge produced by next-generation steelmaking such as, but not limited to the DR / EAF pathway. Such knowledge and results should support the valorisation of the residues in the present value chain and/or in innovative applications. If appropriate, residues could be chemically and structurally characterised at micro-scale level via characterisation (also multi-modal) performed at analytical research infrastructures, which would allow obtaining relevant statistical information;
?	Enhanced utilisation of low-quality scrap by new technologies and by new iron/steel making routes (such as smart BF-BOF routes to be line with decarbonisation targets), targeting high quality of the finished product and reduced CO2 emissions. The aim is to remove scrap impurities (tramp elements) such as, but not limited to, copper before melting, for example through scrap yard management and charge preparation for quality upgrading, or after the melting in liquid phase, through, but not limited to, metallurgical methods;
?	Technologies to broaden the types of ore grades utilized in different processes. The aim is to establish processes that allow for upgrade of low-grade iron ores and other iron- bearing materials to make them suitable for, but not limited to, cold bonded agglomeration, pelletisation, or direct use in existing steelworks.
Scope: In the medium-term scenario, new technologies will enter in the iron and steelmaking production process, e.g., higher amount of scrap in basic oxygen furnaces (BOF), more electric arc furnace (EAF) based steelmaking, as well as more directly reduced production capacity are foreseen. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the influence of the feedstock quality, of the new production technologies and of the composition of the by-products generated on the present model of circular economy for both, economic, and environmental aspects.

Recycling of steel scrap (no matter if it is home-scrap, industrial scrap, or post-consumer scrap), the increased consumption of scrap, the recovery of iron from residues and the use of low-quality iron ore materials are vital to diminish the need for additional primary resource extraction and hence to decrease the environmental impact of steel manufacturing. This is also contributing to a wise and sustainable management approach of iron resources. Applying circular economic principles to product design (thus, designing for remanufacture and recycling) will allow ferrous and non-ferrous metals, such as copper, to be more easily separated and recycled.
Proposals should consider higher utilisation of low-quality iron-bearing materials, in particular, but not limited to, low-quality scrap with higher amounts of unwanted elements (residual and alloying elements, such as Cu, Sn, Sb, As and Bi, but also Cr, Mo, B) that prevent the production of many steel grades and a higher utilisation of internal residues; all focused on the recycling of its metal contents. Where appropriate for the study proposed, analytical research infrastructures, such as synchrotron facilities, should be considered as capable of providing large amount of statistically relevant data. The aim is to obtain a sustainable vision of reduced virgin raw materials use.
Moreover, the existing recycling and reuse solutions for today?s steel industry will be affected and new solutions need to be developed to maintain a sustainable development of the steel industry in the future. Projects should aim at the selection and integration of best available and applicable technologies supported by digital smart tools. These are key elements to improve and adapt circular economy solutions for the long-term goal towards zero waste increasing the use of scrap, the materials recycling rate and the residue valorisation by targeting to achieve the same quality of the finished product and at the same time reducing CO2 emissions due to lower energy need with respect to iron-ore.
Multidisciplinary research activities should address one or more of the following:

?	New technologies for reduce / reuse / recycle of residues and by-products in the next generation iron ore and steelmaking process:
o	Increasing reuse and recycling of steelmaking and foundry slags;
o	Recycling and valorisation of dusts, and sludges;
o	Recovering iron and metal-fractions from in-plant residues;
o	Conditioning processes for the use of residues and low-quality iron ore grades, like agglomeration or pelletisation;
o	Implementing Circular Economy and Industrial Symbiosis for long-term goal towards zero- waste.
?	Sustainable and efficient scrap management and recycling aiming high-grade steel production with increased scrap rates including:

o	Improved mechanical scrap preparation coupled with scrap analyses at various levels;
o	Continuous analysis and monitoring of the scrap bulk composition using sensor systems with accompanied model-supported Big Data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for scrap classification;
o	Scrap yard management and charge preparation for quality upgrading;
o	Optimised and more flexible primary and secondary steelmaking processes considering enhanced scrap rates.

?	Improvements to labour productivity as a result of using the developed solutions
Scope: Existing built works (buildings and infrastructure) can potentially act as a significant ?material bank?, providing a rich source of secondary materials and products for construction. This requires identification and analysis of the asset?s components and materials, which typically involves slow, labour-intensive and costly processes. There is a need to research new digitally powered techniques and technologies that would rapidly and accurately identify,

analyse and record existing construction materials, products and components, facilitating their use in a circular economy and reducing life cycle impacts including embodied carbon. Proposals should therefore aim to foster selective deconstruction, separation of hazardous materials, sorting and high-quality recycling. They would thus contribute to the aims of the New European Bauhaus.
Proposals should:

?	Develop new techniques and technologies to rapidly identify materials, construction products and components of existing built works, or works that have undergone demolition
?	Develop solutions that would rapidly analyse the properties and characteristics of materials, construction products and components, which may include for example material composition, dimensions, mass, technical/mechanical properties and performance, health and safety aspects such as performance in case of fire and the presence of hazardous substances such as asbestos, fixing methods, repair needs, or other aspects
?	Develop solutions to digitally record, categorise and tag existing materials, construction products and elements for their eventual use on the market and inclusion in relevant software tools and databases. Proposals should also support the development of existing tools and databases, where relevant, and ensure that relevant actors across the construction ecosystem are consulted in their development, and take into account SSH aspects of this.
?	Develop solutions that would analyse the suitability of identified elements for use in a circular economy including undergoing appropriate reuse, repair or recycling processes, or conversely to label them as waste including the necessary separation and sorting
?	Research ways in which complex or concealed elements can be identified and analysed, for example materials within the make-up of walls and floors, hidden structures, or composite products
?	Address ways to make circular use of the identified elements as secondary materials or reused products on the market in construction projects, and to track them and their characteristics over asset life cycles
?	Address ways in which the characteristics of identified elements could be presented in a user-friendly manner to relevant actors such as construction professionals, including on- site workers, designers, architects and developers. This should include consideration of SSH and business model aspects.
?	Build on existing standards or contribute to standardisation. Interoperability for data sharing should be addressed, for example in relation to product databases and cross- border collaboration.

?	Present a strategy for skills development, associating social partners where relevant, integrating SSH aspects and including relevant tools such as MOOCs (massive open online courses).
?	Build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms, such as the New European Bauhaus, data spaces under the Digital Europe programme, or the Built4People partnership under Horizon Europe.
?	Seek to integrate insights from social sciences and humanities to maximise economic and social impact",

45	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf

?	Easy access to flexible and decentralised manufacturing and remanufacturing capacities, especially for SMEs, reducing the required investments for manufacturers while enabling them to use more sustainable and circular facilities.
?	Availability of automation, emerging and digital technologies for the servitisation of manufacturing assets assuring optimal performance, fast reconfiguration and upgrade with minimal downtime, remote monitoring and predictive maintenance via trusted, secure and interoperable cross-company data exchange.
?	Improved value chain integration through the availability of technologies and models for securely exchanging and leveraging life-cycle data of servitised manufacturing assets, also in view of the reuse or recycle of assets, components, and materials.
Scope: Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) is a distributed system of production in which resources (including data and software) are offered as services, allowing manufacturers to access distributed providers to implement their manufacturing processes. The servitisation of manufacturing resources contributes significantly to production flexibility and responsiveness, enabling production on demand for many product categories. Suppliers of manufacturing systems and of integration technologies design and offer interoperable services in close partnership with manufacturing companies, while other providers in the value chain can offer additional services. Secure, real-time data exchange between the companies involved enables quick response times.
This topic aims at further developing and integrating the technologies needed for the successful implementation of MaaS allowing to manufacture ?on demand? a large choice of customised products, with high flexibility and short lead time, by using distributed facilities as a service and exploiting unused production capacities, also by rapid re-purposing of manufacturing machines. The objective will be achieved through platforms for fast data exchange and seamless, data-driven, standards-based automation of inter-company processes beyond the factory boundaries.
Integration with digital design, development of design libraries and workflow templates, and advanced technologies such as digital twins, real-time AI-based decision support systems, and next-generation Manufacturing Execution Systems should also be considered where appropriate, with the objective to optimise the entire life-cycle of the product in terms of circularity, sustainability and reusability, using product life cycle assessments whenever appropriate.
Interoperability is a core requirement for MaaS; for this reason, research will build on existing standards or contribute to standardization where relevant, taking also into account the contributions of upcoming EU initiatives like the Digital Product Passport or the Manufacturing Data Spaces.
Results should be demonstrated through at least two realistic use cases, based on different supply chains or industry sectors.

Proposals should explain how the proposed approach contributes to the competitiveness of industry and the sustainability and circularity of production and logistics, through measurable targets.
Proposals submitted under this topic should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

?	Assessing the environmental impact of their products, including the flow of products after their use to reduce product and raw material waste with the support of digital technologies;
?	Achieving a considerable net reduction of the environmental impact through the use of innovative modelling and simulation software that allows transport and manufacture monitoring, ultimately driving the decarbonisation of the manufacturing industry;

?	Facilitating the development and uptake of digital tools/platforms such as the EU Digital Product Passport, to increase traceability and characterisation of materials and products (e.g. at analytical research infrastructures), including environmental footprint and quality;
?	Removing barriers in the uptake of the digital tools from the market will be addressed and the workforce will be empowered through new skills.
Scope: Manufacturing plays a key role in achieving the twin transition goal through enhancing circularity, facilitating decarbonisation whilst enhancing competitiveness. A broad range of digital technologies and engineering tools can be employed to achieve the systemic circularity of the European manufacturers.
Data pooling and sharing among sectors and across the whole value chain, as well as the use of external environmental impact data such as LCA-data, would facilitate recycling and remanufacturing, by modelling and monitoring the life cycle of products and components. Such data pooling would enable a better insight into the CO2-footpring of products and components. To achieve that there is a need to build trust by ensuring data exchange and interoperability across industry sectors and relevant stakeholders, while also focusing on aspects like data quality, cybersecurity, reliability, and accessibility. The forthcoming Sustainable Product Framework (SPI) 46 that has been announced as part of the Circular Economy Action Plan 2.0 in 2020 is proposing the Digital Product Passport to electronically register, process and share product-related information amongst supply chain businesses, authorities and consumers, therefore the manufacturers should be prepared for its implementation.
The transition to the circular manufacturing requires a new mindset and expertise. All the technological improvements of the manufacturing process should always support the human aspect in order to uptake these improvements through upskilling and reskilling of the manufacturing workforce. The workforce should be engaged in the realization of circular approaches and the new manufacturing technologies.
Proposals should cover all of the following aspects:

?	Develop new approaches of Artificial Intelligence to forecasts the environmental impact, also considering the quantity and state of products after their use;
?	Develop innovative simulation and modelling software or built on existing solutions fostering new manufacturing capabilities with a view to a more efficient and more sustainable product design. This optimization process should consider the various steps of the value chain focusing on the environmental impact. Additional ecological impacts arising from the use of the modelling or simulation software should be considered;
?	Develop digital platforms/ tools build on existing interoperability architectures (such as the Asset Administration Shell), that will enable the manufacturers to implement the

Digital Product Passport initiative. The proposals should focus on gathering relevant data, material and product tracking and tracing, certification protocols for secure re-used materials and components among sectors;
?	Enhance the human involvement in the development of the circularity aspects and new technologies.
A close collaboration with EIT Manufacturing is encouraged, in particular on the development of skills.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Enable the technical and economic feasibility of innovative production routes using hydrogen as feedstock51 demonstrated and validated at suitable scale against current state of art of industrial processes;
?	Enable the efficient use and integration of hydrogen as a feedstock in innovative industry processes, considering also fluctuation of availability;

?	Contribute to EU Climate neutrality goal by proving the effectiveness of the GHG emission avoidance in the targeted process;
?	Support Mission Innovation 2.0 NZEID on ?Net-zero Industries? and its ambition via networking and dissemination activities.
Scope: Hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources does not lead to direct carbon dioxide emissions when used and it can offer solutions to decrease GHG emissions in industrial processes. Hydrogen is thus an important enabler for meeting the 2050 climate neutrality goal. In the energy intensive process industries, hydrogen can be used either as feedstock (chemical or reducing agent) or as an energy carrier. The integration of renewable hydrogen into new production routes as a feedstock will lead to major GHG emission reductions across several European industry sectors.
Currently, hydrogen is largely used in industrial sectors such as the chemical industries and refineries. In addition to the current processes, there are different production pathways under development using hydrogen as a chemical feedstock in low-carbon industrial processes. Hydrogen could be used as reducing agent in the production and recovery of metals, biogenic

(P4Planet operational objectives 8 and 9).
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Demonstrate zero urban waste in a near commercial scale environment through systemic resource recovery as alternative material feedstock; a decrease of GHG emissions is also

expected by explicitly addressing the reduced flow of goods (due to geographical proximity);
?	Reduce the freshwater consumption of the urban area by 50%, and re-use 90% of the solid waste generated by the water treatment;
?	Citizens living in cities will benefit from a healthier environment through industrial/urban symbiosis by lowering emissions through circular and renewable energy sources and waste reduction;

Scope: Urban areas with high volumes of waste (household and end of life consumer waste) should closely interact with adjacent industries to jointly minimize their CO2 footprint and improve their waste management, thus contributing together to the valorisation of secondary materials and overall circularity. The hubs for circularity (H4C) concept is a pathway to exploit local synergies for the deployment of innovative solutions engaging regional resource management actors in strategic nodes where novel value chains valorising a significant part of end-of-life wastes could connect within and across regions.
The concept of Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US) should be demonstrated at semi-industrial scale58, by systemically re-integrating the flow of urban wastes in process industries and, where applicable downstream in manufacturing, construction, and other industries. Full attention should be paid on upcycling of secondary materials or products instead of downcycling.
Proposals are expected to address:

?	A systemic solution for a H4C including technological and non-technological as well as regional and interregional aspects: closing circularity loops for mixed/combined materials streams based on upcycling and process-based approach to a range of recycling solutions including conversion and downstream, complex multi-material streams, valorisation of waste streams (urban mining);
?	Proposals can address either materials, water or energy, or a combination of those. Management and processing of secondary resource streams through e.g., collection, disassembly, sorting, purification, concentration, recycling (including but not limited to chemical, metallurgical, or bio-based resources), logistics and trading for their valorisation for the use as feedstock for other plants and companies across sectors and/or

Prepare for tagging/matrix for complex consumer products and innovative approach to end-of life materials;
?	Establish IT infrastructures and tools that provide a secure basis for the integrated management and the preservation of confidentiality of sensitive data, it might not be in the same location as the demonstrator and serve the needs of multiple hubs;
?	Consider when applicable the co-development of industrial decarbonization strategies with urban district heating networks, i.e., based on a socio-economic optimum in the cascading re-use of waste heat and using the district heating network to supply low temperature process heat59;
?	Use established reporting methodologies for the assessment of industrial symbiosis activities and exchanges, including Symbiosis Readiness Levels (SRLs) and best practices established by the European H4C Community of Practice (ECoP). In addition, interact with the ECoP for support, best practice and knowledge exchange on technological and non-technological issues;
?	Plan in detail the replication and adaption of the concept, including the simulation and the business case and exploitation strategy of the First of a Kind hubs, in two to three alternative locations in close cooperation with the relevant local actors. The replication cases should be part of the proposal. Include local and regional authorities in an active collaboration to create favourable and coherent place-based framework conditions;
?	Favour participative management with the local community and study the evolution of the social impact of the hub, whilst also considering gender perspective and inclusiveness;
?	Implement a social innovation action involving at least one of the local community actors and, additional actions to facilitate relations and to involve the local community actors e.g., exchanging knowledge with the educational establishments and developing flexible learning resources;
?	Include a plan to extend the hub to additional players parties (especially waste management and associations, new market entries and other relevant stakeholders) who also should benefit and multiply the local/regional synergies in the co-implementation of the identified innovations and solutions within the next five years.

Scope: The biological transformation of industry is a pioneering frontier that the industry of the Union and Associated Countries can harness to enhance circularity and sustainability, while advancing production efficiency and competitiveness.
The biological transformation of industry involves the integration of bio-intelligent structures, processes, organisms or materials into technology by systematically applying knowledge from biology. This should lead to a necessary convergence of biotechnology with mechanical engineering, production technology and information technology with new possibilities for the flexible adaptation of production and value creation processes to requirements, especially in the context of sustainability.

?	Reduced risks to health and safety of workers in carrying out tasks linked to infrastructure maintenance and repair
?	Cost savings in terms of both operational costs and deferred or avoided capital investment costs
Scope: Regular maintenance and repair of civil engineering infrastructure extends their service life, which in turn reduces the need for their demolition and replacement and the related negative economic, environmental and climate impacts. However, it can be difficult and cumbersome to identify and address maintenance or repair needs, especially in locations that are difficult to access such as large or tall structures, deep shafts, or where elements are hidden from view. Intervention for maintenance and repair can also involve unnecessary risks to health and safety of workers.
Proposals should:

Examples may include structural weaknesses, unacceptable deformation and fatigue, issues related to moisture including mould growth and corrosion, the effects of weathering and of weather-related events, faults in technical systems, leaks of water or chemicals, or other issues.
?	Develop new solutions to monitor and to quickly and accurately analyse and assess the need for intervention, for example via digital twin and simulation technology
?	Develop solutions that would intelligently recommend and prioritise relevant and timely action to address the identified maintenance and repair issues. This should include a risk assessment and application of state-of-the-art quality controls and documentation.
?	Develop solutions that would carry out rapid, cost effective and safe intervention for maintenance and repair of infrastructure, for example using automated or remotely operated tools, or next generation egocentric AR solutions

Sensors are a key technology for electronic appliances serving our society. From manufacturing, improving living conditions, and reducing consumption of energy and precious natural resources, even detecting threats, all rely on the availability of high-quality localized information.
Smart systems and ubiquitous connectivity create opportunities for new applications in smart living, environmental protection, and supply chains. These applications will be made possible through improved sensing technologies, which capture the relevant information. Core properties to enable a wide adoption are miniature size, low power consumption, resilience to varying ambient conditions, low cost, and compatibility with mass production.
To avoid misuse of the captured personal data (e.g. medical), novel concepts of identification of the data originator/provider and data possession are needed. This could include biometric identification mechanisms as well as other fast and secure identification mechanisms, which is GDPR conform and with protected authorisation mechanisms.

This topic refers to the innovation markets for New Energy and for Sustainable Transportation. Several materials specifications and related innovation needs will support this topic such as renewable energy and efficiency, renewable and recyclable materials, sustainable additives and catalysts, advanced surfaces, design for circularity The topic should address several key policies of the European Union such as Circular Economy Action Plan, Zero Pollution Action Plan, A New Industrial Strategy for Europe also in view of critical and strategic raw materials for energy storage and conversion.
In order to deliver the EU's 2030 climate targets under the ?Fit For 55? delivering EU's 2030 climate targets, Europe will need an increasing number of advanced systems for energy transformation for wind turbines and electric drive trains. For this, European industry needs high performance magnets using advanced materials solutions for the new energy innovation market, which shall contain in future lesser amounts of rare-earth metals, in view of the geostrategic dependency on critical raw materials, including rare-earth metals.
Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Europe?s industry will benefit from advanced materials for magnets that are either free from rare-earth metals, or use to a significant extent a substitute and reduce the share of rare-earth metals magnets (compared to the state of art). This will alleviate the dependency and possible supply risks and strengthen Europe?s open strategic autonomy and competitiveness.
?	Europe used 16 kt of rare earths in 2020, and most of them were used to manufacture permanent magnets (NdFeB). This market is still increasing due to the massive electrification of the energy industries. If new magnet composition is successfully developed by 2030 (Nd1Fe12 phases, NdFeMo, high entropy alloys) this permanent magnet could be widely applied, also in offshore wind energy and in industry.
?	The new advanced materials for high-performance magnets must be available at an industrial scale and shall have improved energy-efficiency and performance, whilst at the same time will be easier to recycle with longer and enhanced life cycle.
?	This is in particular necessary to keep up with the political ambitions of the European Green Deal matching the increasing demand for energy harvesting and storage with the ambition to reduce emissions.
Scope: Proposals should address at least four of the following activities:

?	The deployment of permanent-magnets in the energy (e.g. wind-turbine engines for power generation) is of major importance for reaching the green deal ambitions. To achieve this whilst reducing Europe's dependency on Critical Raw Materials, the rare- earth metals for magnets shall be replaced or reduced with inexpensive and non-critical materials.
?	Designing new rare-earth-free permanent magnetic materials (PMM) to replace high performing but critically restrained rare-earth-based PMM could be based for example on new Mn-Bi alloys, other material compositions could also be proposed. As an alternative strategy, composite magnetic materials could be developed. Rare earth-free magnets for turbines with good efficiency levels were already developed and could be further adopted. Projects must demonstrate 50% enhanced magnetic performance (energy products above 55 kJ/m3) with respect to commercial ferrites.
?	Alternatively, the redesigning of rare-earth magnets such as NdFeB magnets should provide for advanced materials where rare-earth metals such as Nd are (partially) replaced. These doped perovskite manganite oxide nanostructures should have the potential to achieve similar or improved magnetic properties such compared to as NdFeB magnets.
?	Advanced material models and simulation tools to extend the usage range of the current critical materials and shorten the development and certification cycle of new materials and processes.

?	Life-cycle assessment and techno-economic assessment (LCA/TEA) will analyse the economic relevance of the new advanced materials for magnets. This will also address aspects of circularity, and end-of-life aspects. Strategies for the recycling of the new advanced materials will support the whole design process.
?	Delivering a scaling will increase the production to an industrial level for advanced materials for magnets that are rare-earth metal free or where rare-earth metals are substituted.
To enable a fast development of new advanced materials, digital tools such as modelling, simulation and characterisation techniques (including those provided by analytical infrastructures) are under the scope, assisted by advanced methods e.g. physics-based methods, machine learning or artificial intelligence.

Scope: Actions should strengthen an EU expert network and community covering all raw materials screened in the CRM assessment of 2020 , and additional raw materials screened in 2023 assessment (neon, krypton, xenon, roundwood). Flexibility in screening additional raw materials is an added value.
The consortium should build the EU expert community covering each screened raw material with expertise on primary and secondary resources; production, including exploration, mining, processing, recycling and refining; substitution of CRM; raw materials markets; future demand and supply; supply risk management and stress tests; materials flows; raw materials standardisation; socio-economic analysis, and strategic value chains and end-use sectors, including batteries, e-mobility, renewable energy, electronics, defence and aerospace.
The actions should flexibly support the Commission in policy making related to Critical Raw Materials in general or linked to specific applications or sectors; as well in the relevant events organised by the Commission.
The actions should also improve data and knowledge on all screened raw materials; and support the Commission in the analysis of the future supply and demand of raw materials, technology gaps and innovation potential along the raw materials value chains.
The action should update the data and information fact sheets from the previous criticality exercise for all screened raw materials, and ensure their quality by relevant raw material experts. Factsheets are to be finalised by the end of 2025, and could be fine-tuned before publication expected in 2026.
The action is expected to organise two expert validation workshops in 2025 to support the EU criticality assessment, and validate draft factsheets for all screened materials. On request of the Commission, organise in-depth workshops on several strategic metals (agreed with the Commission) for renewable energy, e-mobility and defence with recognised commodity experts from industry and other organisations.
The action should provide policy briefs and analyses based on requests from the Commission and proposed work shall be coordinated with the Commission's work and relevance reviewed in the light of policy development and needs.
The actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant selected projects for cross-projects co-operation, consultations and joint activities on cross-cutting issues and share of results as well as participating in joint meetings and communication events.

Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Develop more cost effective and resource efficient rare earth permanent magnets.
?	Improve recyclability, re-use, refurbishment and/or repurposing of end-of-life magnets.
?	Improve responsible supply of raw materials to Europe in line with the EU principles for sustainable raw materials, which are a non-regulatory set of principles based on the EU acquis.

?	Demonstrate contributions to EU climate neutrality objectives.
Actions are expected to contribute to the implementation the EU action plan on Critical Raw Materials128 and the action plan on Rare Earth Magnets and Motors from the European Raw Materials Alliance129.
Scope: Actions should improve design of rare earth permanent magnets that facilitate the reuse, re-use, refurbishment and/or repurposing and recycling and/or reduce the use of the critical raw materials. Priority is neodymium magnets, but other highly performant magnets can also be targeted if duly justified. The actions should finish at the TRL levels 6-7.

?	EU strategies/policies and regulations, such as the (proposed) Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation130, the EU Ecolabel131, REACH132 or CLP133 can build on new methods and the associated data for chemicals and materials;
?	Methods and data will be made available in a format which will allow existing validation networks or bodies (e.g., the EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM) or the OECD) or other platforms to launch a validation/standardisation process and to promote wider uptake of the new methods developed;
?	Industry and public authorities have access to innovative tools for more comprehensive safety and sustainability assessment covering a wider range of chemicals and advanced materials including composites/mixtures and nanomaterials, supporting the implementation of the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework134.
Scope: The Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design 135 (SSbD) sets a framework for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials, which should be considered as a reference for project proposals. This topic aims at developing new methods, or improve existing methods, to support the improvement of safety and sustainability assessment.
In the EU, the legislation regulating chemical substances often includes their safety screening and testing according to the EU test methods regulation136, which predominantly contains test methods harmonised under the OECD137. For safety assessment, e.g., human and eco-toxicity, there is a lack of validated in vitro and in silico tools for a variety of substances and materials. An advance in alternative methods for safety assessment (e.g., New Approach Methodologies, NAMs) is needed, preferably without animal models, but also to support modelling and design of new Safe and Sustainable by Design chemicals and materials. Research should improve and harmonise screening and testing protocols/strategies and hazard/risk assessments by developing robust, reliable and faster test methods or models, including high-throughput and in silico models.
Sustainability aspects cover the entire life cycle including the design phase, raw material extraction, production, use and end-of-life. Sustainability assessment across the life cycle is in growing demand and there is the need to further develop methods for a robust assessment.

The development of absolute sustainability methods 138 that consider ecosystems carrying capacities are also needed. The integration of life cycle assessment with risk assessment is likewise a challenge. New and improved approaches are needed to increase the quality, the efficiency and the effectiveness of existing methods to drive innovation and to bridge gaps in the data for sustainability and life cycle assessment.
Proposals should consider all the following activities:

?	Address a set of at least three chemicals/groups of chemicals/(advanced) materials for which the project consortium will develop new methods and models for safety and sustainability assessment along their life cycle in accordance with the Safe and Sustainable by Design Framework139. Selected materials can be composed of/contain the selected chemicals. The justification for their selection should include socio-economic aspects and a gap analysis with regards to existing methods and models and their relevance to improve the current safety and sustainability assessments;
?	Methods and models developed can be either for the already existing chemicals and materials or to be used during the design phase of future chemicals and materials;
?	For each method or model developed an ?in project interlaboratory? validation should be done, and the method or model shall be shared via the most appropriate open platform, e.g., the Horizon Europe Partnership on the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC)140, to encourage use and feedback from stakeholders. In addition, an initial standardisation or validation dossier should be prepared and submitted to an appropriate body/initiative, e.g., the OECD, EU Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL ECVAM);
?	Data produced during the development process and in particular for inclusion in the validation/standardisation dossier must be FAIR 141 and shared through available platforms (e.g., the Information Platform for Chemical Monitoring ? IPCHEM142). Data for the validation/standardisation dossier shall be produced according to existing guidelines and stored in standardised data formats.
International collaboration on uptake of new methods and/or models shall be enhanced involving relevant players from academia, public authorities and the private sector.

The projects should acknowledge and account for the fact that safety and sustainability of a chemical or material are the result of a mix of intrinsic properties (dependent only on the chemical or material itself) and extrinsic properties (dependent on how the chemical or material is produced or used, and in which quantity and resulting exposures). The proposals should also aim to foster the acceptance and effective uptake of the developed approaches within different sectors. The developed methodologies should support and facilitate decision making when having to weight multiple sustainability criteria against each other. The developed methodologies should contribute to the estimation of health, environmental as well as social and economic impacts at EU and global scale.
Proposals should consider all the following activities:

?	Select chemicals/group of chemicals/(advanced)materials for which they will develop an integrated approach for health, environment, social and economic impact assessments and justify this selection in view of their societal relevance;
?	Development of methodologies and associated guidelines for integrated health, environment, social and economic impact assessments. Existing life cycle methodologies should be built on;
?	Identification of data gaps and data availability along the value chain as regards all relevant sustainability dimensions (environmental, health, social and economic factors) for the targeted substance/group of substances and in particular identification and monetization of externalities arising during the life cycle of a chemical or a material;
?	Identification and engagement of all relevant stakeholders along the value chain to take into account the existence of conflicting interests and potential impacts affecting

?	The EU climate ambitions 153 will be supported by contributing to a decrease of greenhouse gas emissions through a more sustainable production and use of chemicals and materials;
Scope: The Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design154 sets a framework for assessing safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials, which should be considered as a reference in the proposal.
For an effective substitution of substances of concern 155 it is crucial that the developed alternatives provide the functionality that is required of those that are replaced (e.g., water or dirt repellent properties, insulation, etc.), and have an improved safety and sustainability performance. The integration by computational modelling of the chemicals and materials functionality with the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework will have a key role in the green and digital transition of the European industry. These tools will allow the exploration of which technical solutions are the most appropriate for respecting the Safe and Sustainable by Design requirements in a cost- and policy-effective manner and thereby accelerate the innovation process for Safe and Sustainable by Design chemicals and materials.
Proposals should therefore:

?	Produce innovative modelling software for the development of chemicals and materials (including advanced materials) building on high-throughput chemicals and materials characterisation facilities and relevant models and make it available and interlinked through open platforms accessible to SMEs and industry;
?	Develop predictive computational models and software to forecast the sustainability performance and support the assessment of sustainability aspects for newly designed chemicals or materials, in a tiered approach, already in the early stages and along the innovation process;
?	Enable the integration of materials modelling, safety and sustainability assessment tools and databases into a single workflow. Apply AI techniques for data search and missing data, including statistical analysis (sensitivity and uncertainty), in all the areas covered: modelling of the functionality, safety and sustainability assessment (including life cycle assessment);
?	Address information exchange on chemicals and materials along value chains and throughout their life cycle and provide solutions for data accessibility in the different steps of the value chain for modelling/assessment purposes;

Such collaboration should be extended to the manufacturing industries and their digital marketplaces so that data and information to design new materials can be shared by all interested stakeholders in a faster way.
Platforms integrating materials data management, modelling, characterisation and harnessing machine learning and automation have the potential to accelerate substantially the design, development and upscaling of new advanced materials by a time factor of 5-10 and decrease the costs associated with innovation chain and market exploitation. The necessary acceleration and cost decrease should be directly beneficial for any subsequent manufacturing process.
Actions are required that ensure synergies and common approaches across strategic innovation markets driven by advanced materials, to capitalise on commonalities and to ensure interoperability and integration of all methodologies. There should be collaboration with existing European and national data spaces and marketplaces on interfaces and metadata, in order to ease the access and improve the (re-) use of materials data.
Proposals should address all of the following activities:

?	Establish an inventory of relevant existing collaborative materials data and information systems (platforms, databases and infrastructures) serving strategic innovation markets.
?	Network the identified data and information systems and make them accessible and usable for any stakeholder interested in the research, development or deployment of advanced materials research results.
?	Establish common methodologies for data acquisition and knowledge generation:
o	Modelling, including data- and physics-based materials modelling
o	Characterisation, including multi-scale, multi-technique, in/on-line
o	Materials synthesis and fabrication technologies including autonomous robotics platforms
o	Machine learning and AI-based methods
?	Based on the scope of the strategic innovation markets, and on the methodologies above for acquiring data and generating knowledge, develop a common language for data documentation and exchange on advanced materials and related manufacturing processes through widely agreed vocabularies, taxonomies as well as relevant domain ontologies based on the Industry Commons Ontology Commons EcoSystem (OCES)128 and the Elementary Multiperspective Material Ontology (EMMO)129, covering all relevant methodologies (including modelling and characterisation).
?	Demonstrate easy access to reliable data and information/knowledge by connection of identified databases with the ontologies, providing a resource for the materials developers community and for industries. This demonstration should be done with a

number of case studies in different areas of application of advanced materials and considering the entire value chain.
?	Integrate data and methods for life-cycle assessment and take into account the safe and sustainable by design framework for chemicals and materials.
?	Establish a cost overview and a business plan for the sustainability for a digital knowledge sharing system and the supporting coordination network across materials development communities and industries up to 2035 and beyond.
?	Establish training schemes to facilitate skills development, reskilling and upskilling in the relevant methodologies, with particular emphasis on digital skills for all interested stakeholders.
Proposals should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European and national initiatives, funding programmes and platforms, in particular with the ?Materials 2030 Roadmap? and any follow up actions.161

It is essential for companies to map their supply chain in order to identify critical dependencies and weaknesses in specific industrial ecosystem. There is a need for developing methodology or model that can assist companies in detecting and anticipating disruptions in their supply chains. Such a model would contribute to reduce strategic dependencies on critical products, services or technologies.
Through the adoption of advanced technologies, the manufacturing industry will achieve operational independence. This operational improvement will be of paramount importance in ensuring performance during the next normal. In fact, COVID-19's impact on trade caught many firms unprepared, with negative consequences on supply chains. This event drastically changed the focus from a low-cost country sourcing mantra to a more resilient and simpler network. Implementing new technologies is turning supply chain processes and activities towards less uncertainty and complexity. Technologies like robotics, AI, IoT, blockchain, and edge computing are the key drivers to achieve these goals, together with efficiency benefits and zero-touch production (ZTP) processes, the latter being pushed significantly during the pandemic and becoming a strategic asset for the future of enterprises.
Efficiency is also fostered by AR/VR solutions, which enable experts to provide remote support to on-field operators and provide step-by-step instructions. B2B digital platforms are also a key trend in the manufacturing industry, pushing for a more collaborative relation between colleagues, peers, and employees. This opportunity is deeply connected to Big Data/analytics technology, which allows the user to track and analyse processes, improve operational visibility, and understand improvements and trends. 3D printing has shown its huge potential in creating and modifying manufacturing and healthcare products during the pandemic and is likely to be a key trend in the coming years. Product innovation is also driving the adoption of advanced materials, micro- and nanoelectronics, nanotechnologies, and photonics with the aims of improving products and reducing costs",
HORIZON-CL4-2023-RESILIENCE-01-44, Affordable Housing District Demonstrator (IA),4/20/2023,IA,12/1/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to following outcomes:

?	Demonstrate innovation in renovation or construction of social housing districts to obtain replicable demonstrators or ?lighthouse affordable housing districts? following the principles of the Affordable Housing Initiative 163 and, more broadly, taking into account the values and the concept of the New European Bauhaus164. Demonstrators can contribute to a smart neighbourhood approach setting liveability of local communities and residents at the forefront.
?	Mobilise within the project a cross-sectoral industrial 165 and multi-stakeholder partnerships at local level to develop, adapt, design new processes, methods or technologies on affordable housing (by developing one or more innovative strands), with a focus on SMEs active in the area of social housing construction, renovation and development. Examples include SMEs related to construction, energy efficiency, circular economy, modular building, smart living, eco-design, social housing service etc.. Equally engaging other non SME stakeholders such as residents, social and public housing associations, civil society actors, public authorities will be key to boost tailor- made and fit for purpose innovation;

165	Refers to the 14 Industrial Ecosystems for Recovery

?	Demonstrators should go the ?extra mile? and prove continuity in terms of a more integrated renovation or new build approach at district level by demonstrating one or more innovative strand(s):
a.	Adapted and affordable technological innovation fostering liveability for local communities and residents, accessibility, access to (social) services, improving cohabitation amongst residents and interaction with social housing providers.
b.	Social innovation, addressing specific social challenges in housing districts and neighbourhoods. Examples could be models improving the wellbeing of residents, addressing basic needs and services, promote new forms of housing and housing organisation such as intergenerational and mixed forms of housing and accessible architecture open for cultural and creative innovation. Social innovation may also promote social business models fostering economic activity at district or neighbourhood level.
c.	Innovative partnership and engagement models: project, financial, investment and business models based on inclusivity and cooperation, as well as partnership models improving stakeholders? involvement in the construction process. Examples could be cooperative models for housing and utilities (cooperative housing, community land trust), leveraging social engagement models to empower and engage residents, public private partnership and impact investment schemes, post renovation planning and spatial organisation allowing socio-economic regeneration of the district.
d.	Green innovation. Examples could be: resource efficiency, circular and environment friendly techniques during the construction process as well as facilities and interventions fostering the ecologic ambition of housing once the construction is completed (such as integration of green spaces, improvement of biodiversity, landscaping, water-, waste- and energy management, shared consumption models, clean mobility provision, green spaces, city agriculture, air quality, monitoring instruments,?) as well as deployment of a Positive Energy District166.
Replicability of innovative solutions demonstrated by the project is important. To this extent, relevant indicators and metrics, with baseline values, should be stated clearly in the proposal.
Effectively capture and disseminate learnings and major innovation outcomes to support the implementation of industrial-urban symbiosis, connection to European communities of practices established by the Affordable Housing Initiative and the New European Bauhaus or other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Agenda.
The ultimate objective of the proposed action is to obtain a set of lighthouse affordable housing districts that each have followed a different approach, focussing on one or a combination of different innovative strands.


166	https://jpi-urbaneurope.eu/ped/

The proposed action supports the New European Bauhaus and Affordable Housing Initiative, as lighthouse districts should display the application of the New European Bauhaus practices focussing on co-creation with the affected populations as well as on their improved quality of experience (including in terms of aesthetic or cultural meaningfulness) resulting from the renovation and building of social housing districts.
Scope: Industrial symbiosis needs to be fostered amongst most relevant partners engaged in construction and renovation of social housing facilities. The local and regional dimension is important since local energy and utility networks, adjacent industrial infrastructures and available by-products and services in such districts needs to be considered in a holistic and integrated approach.
Where appropriate, projects can address COVID-19 related challenges and opportunities such as reorganisation of housing areas and districts, conversion of office buildings into housing units, (inter)generational living, housing facilities addressing new work-life standards and needs, neighbourhoods driving local economic activity and new entrepreneurial opportunities, energy price shocks, increased material costs, etc.
When proposing the demonstrating district, projects are expected to address all following aspects:
?	Identify districts that are ""ready to go"" or at least in an advanced planning stage allowing the integration of an ?extra mile? effort in terms of one or more innovation strands.
?	As a basic condition, energy efficiency and insulation aspects should be already integrated in the renovation scheme; potentially including local renewable energy production and energy communities.
?	Generate results that are replicable for other districts. In this context ?replicable? is to be understood as: outcomes generated by the demonstrator projects? implantation (for example, know-how, innovative solutions, proof of feasibility, new business models, adapted and scaled technology usage, policy recommendations, guidelines, prototypes, demonstrators, databases and datasets, trained researchers, new infrastructures, networks) should be directly usable or transferable for implementation after the project ends. Results should be appropriately documented to serve as guidance for actors in other territories outside the project interested in applying or adapting the solutions to their specific context.
?	Plan actions for overcoming relevant barriers for renovation at district level (e.g. regulatory limits, lack of trust amongst different stakeholders, lack of private investors and awareness of the integrated approach potential);
?	Guarantee a majority (+50%) of social housing dwellings including a dominant focus on affordability for the remaining dwellings.

?	Ensure to prevent potential perverse effects are taken into account such as energy poverty, gentrification effect, creaming and 'renovictions' or ?ghettoisation? and make sure resident engagement is embedded.
In terms of project design and methodology, proposals should include:

?	The development of an ambitious, mission-oriented, quality co-design process, based on citizens? and stakeholders' participation and multidisciplinary and multilevel collaboration An ambitious and credible executive plan that identifies and analyses the challenges and resources of a given territory (e.g. neighbourhood, district, ecosystem) in terms of sustainability (in line with the European Green Deal), inclusiveness (including social cohesion, accessibility and affordability) and aesthetics (including functionality, comfort, attractiveness, etc.).
?	Deployment of an initial set of solutions as demonstrators within a two-year timeframe, accompanied by a rigorous impact evaluation methodology. Involvement in the testing of the innovation actions within the demonstrators with international experts.
?	A detailed roadmap for implementation, with a sustainable financial plan identifying potential and substantial additional investment based on involvement and partnerships with different actors (national, regional, local, public and private sources).
?	Projects are expected to participate in European-level networking opportunities in the context of the Affordable Housing Initiative
?	Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus initiative by interacting with the New European Bauhaus Community, NEBLab and other relevant actions of the initiative through sharing information, best practice, and, where relevant, results.

Projects are expected to contribute to the Plastics strategy, the Single-use Plastics Directive and the EU Circular Economy Action plan (CEAP).
?	Standards and labels for specific applications will be further defined based on the development of testing of biodegradability of plastics in open environments
Scope: Proposals should address at least four of the following activities:

?	Develop new, demonstrate and scale-up novel advanced bio-degradable polymer materials and innovative processes that will allow the bio-degradable polymers to be produced at a large scale with a similar economy of scale to replace present production with PE, PP and PET, and with an improved sustainability profile compared to present production and EoL characteristics.
?	Develop sustainable additives and catalysts to support the production of bio-degradable polymers.
?	Provide evidence with life cycle and techno-economic assessment (LCA/TEA) that the cost for the novel advanced biodegradable polymer products are not significantly higher compared to existing polymer products (PE, PP, PET) on the market.
?	Scale up the production of packaging materials at pilot level.
?	Identify and test the biodegradability pathways in all environmentally relevant conditions (for the application of the developed material in relevant shape or form); and extensive quantified risk analysis from both a human and environmental perspective for all the different intermediate and end products of biodegradation, including quantification of the contribution to GHG emissions. Contribute to further defining standards and labels for specific applications. Model the lifetime of the developed

polymers along the biodegradation pathway in environmentally relevant conditions, both in natural, (terrestrial and marine), and in waste processing environments.
?	Demonstrate complete biodegradability in all relevant conditions and environmental compartments (e.g. landfill, compost site, litter in marine-freshwater-sediment-soil) within acceptable timeframes, determination of the main influencing environmental conditions; and assessment of the impact on the environment. Integrate a holistic sustainability assessment, accounting for the full life cycle (including sourcing of feedstock).
Develop and demonstrate circular business model for production at industrial level, where the release of GHG emissions is; and assess significantly reduced; and assess the potential of secondary raw materials as a feedstock (including from renewable sources) for the production of bio-degradable polymers.

The action will build on and further connect existing EU specialised business support networks and centres ? such as the Enterprise Europe Network, the European industry clusters registered under the European Cluster Collaboration Platform, Centres for Advanced Technologies for Industry. They will work in complementarity and close interaction with Open Innovation Test beds, European Digital Innovation Hubs, Start-up Europe etc., but also with academia, social partners and other social innovation actors.
This action will consist in:

A.	Advisory services

Dedicated innovation and capacity building support will be provided to SMEs, to assess their ability to transform their business models and increase their resilience.
This will consist of an assessment of SMEs? innovation and sustainability practices, elaboration of recommendations, notably in view of the uptake of advanced technologies and/or social innovations.
Based on these recommendations, SMEs could receive further advisory services according to their level of preparedness such as help and advice on proof of concept, investment readiness, intellectual property (in cooperation with EU funded IP support), technology transfer, adaptation to standards, adaptation to environmental rules, design management, skill development, partner search (including social partners). SMEs will receive targeted assistance for the uptake of advanced technologies.
Social innovation should be recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
This action will also include the set-up of a community, building on the SME Alliance projects, in which best practices should be exchanged and SMEs could benefit from dedicated peer-learning activities in order to learn from leaders (SMEs or larger corporates) of their own sector. Incentives for leaders to share their best practices with peers should be identified in the context of EU support to industrial ecosystems.
B.	Financial support in the form of ?Third party financing?

As a result of the advisory services and initial assessments, SMEs will receive financial support through calls for SMEs, to implement the elaborated recommendations.
This should support amongst other activities the financing of a feasibility study, prototyping, pilot testing, demonstrating, procurement of further specialised consultancy services and coaching services that cannot be provided directly by the project partners, adaptation of business processes, free access and support to use testing facilities, introduction of new IT solutions etc.
The Commission estimates that at least half of the budget should be allocated to financial support to SMEs in the form of third party financing.

?	ability to process vast volumes data as one of the key enablers for other technological developments, supporting the competitiveness of the EU?s industrial ecosystems;
?	successful deployment of data spaces involving several sectors of economy or society;
?	improve data access (in line with the FAIR 214 principles), data sovereignty, data interoperability and data protection as an essential factor in the development of sustainable value chains respecting all stakeholder interests, particularly SMEs, but also the public sector as data providers and innovation/market ecosystem enablers. The European Strategy for Data215 calls for actions to support and promote data sharing and the use of data for social and economic benefit.
Scope: Proposals should address the entire data life cycle from data generation/collection to the final use and disposal/deletion of data (especially when required by applicable legislation, for example the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)216. Proposals should build on existing and emerging standards, models and architectures and complement/expand them as necessary in view of interoperability of systems and portability of data, especially between sectors, between private and public sectors and between different communities/constituencies of actors, including consideration of cybersecurity issues and analysing the use and re-use potential, especially in view of use of data across sectors. Envisaged architectures and systems should enable correct allocation and enforcement of data-related rights, obligations and responsibilities across the life cycle. Proposals should address relevant human language issues at all stages of data life cycle, addressing the social and cultural factors as necessary. Systems and approaches should be able to process human-generated and human-related data (e.g. speech, text, images) and put data into context (including cultural, linguistic and social context). Likewise, the seamless integration of ?human in the loop? (whenever full automation is not possible/desirable) should be considered and implemented where applicable. To achieve this, proposals should consider multidisciplinary research and involve all necessary competences in the consortium.
Proposed actions should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. Based on an analysis of cross-fertilisation potential of data re-use, the proposal should include use cases or pilots addressing or involving at least three different common European Data spaces and/or related ecosystems.

?	Support structure for EU-NSF cooperation: networking events, exchange and fellowship programmes, and vision workshops for the academic and industrial computing community, at least one annual EU-US workshop.
Scope: DG Connect and the relevant entity at US National Science Foundation (NSF) have identified mutual interest in collaborating on longer-term on fundamental research on new concepts for distributed computing and swarm intelligence. Preparing the grounds for cooperation, support is needed in terms of a landscaping analysis of relevant tools and frameworks in this field, with clearly identified mutual benefit, organising brokerage events for matching of on-going work streams in projects, especially linked to but not limited to the topic HE-CL4-2022-DATA-01-03 - Programming tools for decentralised intelligence and swarms, whilst promoting the emergence of open, collaborative programming frameworks and software development tools. Collaboration shall address common needs emerging on managing complexity through high levels of abstraction, in particular related to large numbers of distributed objects, evolving computational capacity at the edge, and on new AI-based concepts leading to self-organised, dynamic, and adaptive management..
Support for this collaboration is envisaged along the following lines:

?	Yearly common workshops for exchange of research results organised in close collaboration with the HIPEAC CSA under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 ?From Cloud-to-Edge-to-IoT for European Data?.
?	Support to the collaboration through support for secretarial services, networking including travel, research exchange and fellowship programmes, promotion and brokerage events.
?	NSF would provide supplement of funding to drive joint research and support collaboration.

217	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf

?	Enhanced openness and open strategic autonomy in the evolving data and AI-economies across the computing continuum including adapted system integration at the edge and at device level, validation of key sectors and nurturing European value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions.
?	Paving the way to strategic industrial cooperation in data processing required to support future hyper-distributed applications by building open platforms, underpinning an emerging industrial open edge ecosystem critical to establishing a mature European supply chain.
?	Establishment of adaptive hybrid computing, cognitive clouds and edge intelligence beyond today?s investments on data infrastructure.
?	Better international collaboration with trusted partner regions, guaranteeing a minimum level of interoperability, portability thereby fostering competition in the Cloud/Edge services market for the European cloud/edge and software industry and facilitate European access to foreign markets.
Scope: The Cloud-Edge Continuum must provide seamless management schemes to allow services and data to be processed across various providers, connectivity types and network zones. This requires innovative management techniques and computational methods of the whole computing continuum from Cloud to Edge to IoT that are enabled by Swarm computing and decentralised intelligence.
It involves hyper-distributed computing approaches encompassing resources from IoT and far-edge constrained devices, to federated fog/edge computing nodes to central cloud computing centres and hybrid cloud models which exploit Artificial Intelligence techniques to advance automation and dynamic adaptation of resource management in Cloud and Edge systems, and thus intelligently balance computing tasks across decentral and central computing environments to optimize resources and quality of service.
Focus should be on autonomous and AI-enabled management schemes and data processing methods that enable this transition to a compute continuum with strong capacities at the edge and fog/IoT edge in an energy efficient and trustworthy manner. Intelligent compute, data and code orchestration mechanisms need to be integrated, which allow efficient value extraction from the huge volumes of generated data at the edge of the network and which support unprecedented levels of resource dynamicity and scalability across the compute continuum.
Concept should cater for novel automated management tools, programming models, learning and decision-making methods, and approaches able to cope with end-to-end security and identity management, resources heterogeneity, extreme scale and fault-tolerance together with elasticity to flexibly allocate resources and tasks. For learning, methods need to be able to deliver a solution to (continuous) federated learning from data distributed over the edge and in the network. For security and identity management, proposals are expected to apply state-of- the-art technologies, develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes in Cluster 3 (namely, HORIZON-CL3-2023-CS-01-01: Secure Computing Continuum (IoT, Edge, Cloud,

Dataspaces) and HORIZON-CL3-2023-CS-01-02: Privacy-preserving and identity management technologies).
Resource heterogeneity should consider the diversity of devices equipped with storage and processing capacities at the Edge and their specific characteristics (e.g., resource?constrained devices), but also the increasingly available variety of processor architectures for these devices, including where possible, emerging open solutions (e.g. RISC-V).
Novel approaches are needed to support distributed machine learning and decision-making by providing the right balance between centralized and decentralized solutions to maximize the energy efficiency, resilience and effectiveness of the system while increasing privacy and interaction between different organizations without explicit sharing of data.
In addition, proposed solutions should incorporate tools and mechanisms enabling the optimisation of energy efficiency and ecological sustainability taking into account end-to- end data processing across the continuum. Interoperability approaches (based on open standards, interoperability models and open platforms) should be considered where appropriate.
Projects are expected to develop synergies and relate to activities and outcomes of the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) and any existing or emerging Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) initiative.

Scope: Proposals should target up-take and up-scaling of emerging EU-driven smart industrial internet of things and edge computing systems to perform under real life conditions, as to mature particular technologies like meta-operating systems for the IoT and the Edge, cognitive cloud technologies and tools for decentralized intelligence and swarm computing

for adoption across key applications and sectors crucial for Europe?s competitiveness and open strategic autonomy.
Such systems must be targeted in order to create value in orchestrating multi-tiered data processing with control and automation on the edge, minimizing energy footprint, stimulating multi-sided marketplaces, and fostering open standards for virtualization, interoperability and secure and trusted data sharing between different stakeholders of the value chain ? both horizontally and vertically, thereby providing an environment of multi-platform capabilities and preventing lock-in effects for users. Pilots are to implement and demonstrate mature solutions, on technology integration such as sensors, actuators, distributed control, connectivity and edge computing and embedded reasoning to demonstrate security, resilience and autonomy of system with low data processing latency for analytics and AI-inference and decentralised intelligence at the edge. In order to avoid concurrent solutions and fragmented standards and tools, pilots should validate cross-domain interfaces and common standards and foster cross-sector industrial agreements on architectures, design tools and governance. With the cross-domain up-take these pilots will demonstrate shorter development circles, accelerate adoption of edge infrastructure through shared cross-domain usage, especially through the creation of common management tools and standardised edge architectures
The objective is the development of systems to become open platforms underpinning an emerging open edge ecosystem including midcaps, SMEs and start-ups that foster edge solutions, which represent a modular functional spectrum of executable apps and services critical to establishing a mature European supply chain under challenging and extremely competitive market conditions
Innovation Actions are used to customise, explore the limits, test, optimise and validate emerging European smart IoT and edge computing systems under the constraints of industrial mass-market applications, by taking a system-level approach from hardware of smart devices to operating systems at device and at system level, to middleware and to application software. Pilots are expected to address cross-sector platforms in more than one application domain, which are strategic for European competitiveness such as renewable energy, buildings and electro-mobility, farming and/or industrial automation, including strategic aspects such as condition-monitoring/predictive maintenance and logistics, or other relevant application domains.

?	Achieve substantial ?next step autonomy? in robots, undertaking non-repetitive tasks in realistic settings, including Human-Robot interactions, as well as robots acting in isolation, demonstrated in key high impact sectors where robotics has the potential to deliver significant economic and/or societal benefits. This next step autonomy should clearly delineate from state of the art solutions and can be illustrated by the following non-exhaustive examples235:
o	In autonomy to reach the point where the robot systems, operating in complex and dynamic working environments can autonomously select the tasks and task sequences that are needed to achieve long term mission goals over long periods of autonomous operation, relative to the current state of the art, and are able to react and adapt to changes in both the environment and to the external instructions received from unskilled or semi-skilled human users. For example in being able to carry out maintenance tasks on a structure after having conducted an inspection to ascertain the type of maintenance needed (e.g. on renewable energy installations such as wind turbines, photovoltaic farms, or in the maintenance of city infrastructure such as wastewater systems or road and rail infrastructures).
o	In human interaction to reach the point where robots are able to autonomously adapt in order to socially interact with people in an everyday working environment in order to achieve task outcomes through intuitive interaction that is multi-modal; by voice, physical, gestural etc. and to collaboratively achieve complex tasks that require multiple functional capabilities where humans and robots contribute equally to those capabilities. For example in complex healthcare tasks such as patient handling or in complex logistical operations such as the optimal packing of consumer goods for shipping.
o	In manipulation, to be able to achieve more complex manipulative tasks autonomously, requiring advanced perception and task understanding, as well as adaptive planning to anticipate possible changes in the environment during task execution. Robotic manipulation systems should target speed and dexterity with respect to a wide range of different objects and materials.
Projects are also expected to contribute to the following additional outcomes:

?	Deliver a step change in autonomy essential for the diffusion of robots in various industries, sectors and services which can;

Make and exploit major advances in science and technology, to maintain Europe?s scientific excellence and ensure sovereignty of key technologies in robotics and autonomous systems expected to affect society by contributing to addressing major societal and economic challenges.
Scope: The currently low level of autonomy achieved by most robotics systems is a major obstacle to the wide-scale deployment of robots with advanced capabilities in many real- world applications. Most robots still require an important level of human supervision. However, in many potentially valuable applications robots need to work with greater levels of autonomy to create effective end user added value.
Future robotic systems will be required to autonomously adapt and alter their behaviours to respond to changes in the working environment and adjust to changes in task requirements without direct human supervision.
Achieving next step autonomy in robotics will require greater integration of AI technologies into the physical functioning of robots. This in turn requires AI to operate in real time at pace with the physical motion of the robot. Interpreting the working environment, interacting with complex objects or people and making and updating decision making, all in real time, requires a significant advance from the current state of the art. This will require novel architectures both in software and hardware and will require AI algorithms compatible with physical, real time, robot operation. In terms of R&I advancement a paradigm shift is needed to remove silos between disciplines in order to weld together expertise and create a conceptual shift to reach the goals of next step autonomy for robotics.
The primary outcome will be that important applications for robots become possible as a result of achieving next step autonomy in specific use cases and sectors.
Achieving this goal will require improvements in perception, awareness of the operating environment, the ability to anticipate and an improved understanding of the consequences of particular sequences of action on the working environment.

?	Mechanisms for advanced human interaction with systems capable of long-term autonomy.
?	The impact of physical self-reconfiguration on autonomy

Scope: To support the green and digital industrial transition, there is the need to develop innovative routes to accelerate the design and production of new advanced materials, improving the circular economy and developing alternative feedstocks to support the EU?s open strategic autonomy throughout value chains (and covering all aspects of sustainability). Industrial research for materials from laboratory to production requires the extension of current knowledge on materials behaviour to the entire value chain.
To tackle this challenge, we can build on European leadership in recent advances in multi- scale modelling and characterisation.
The development of novel advanced materials requires a wide and complex range of trusted information on materials and process behaviour, along the entire life-cycle of a material, reaching far beyond the data sets generally available to industry currently. In particular, an approach is required that provides end users with highly flexible, adaptable modelling and characterisation tools as a source of data and knowledge in critical application fields. Subsequently, the validation of the developed methods will help industry to establish trust in these methods. This will also support the emerging need for adopting alternative materials as feedstock compliant with the high qualification standards and strengthen the strategic autonomy and resilience of EU?s industry.
Proposals should address the development of benchmarked, integrated suites of models and characterisation methods for critical application fields in strategic innovation markets (*) covering the different stages in materials and industrial production value chains and circularity.
In particular, proposals should address all of the following:

?	Develop integrated methodologies of multi-scale and multi-technique characterisation, combined with respective multi-scale modelling and machine learning to

o	understand scaling relationships in the behaviour of advanced materials;

o	Developing accurate, validated physics-based models, in areas where these capabilities are a bottleneck, by utilising a combination of characterisation and machine learning to generate material and application specific parameters and equations (called materials relations, ref. CWA 17284237).

?	Achieve the substantial next step in the ability of robots to perform non-repetitive functional tasks in realistic settings, based on underlying robot functions (e.g. guidance/navigation/manipulation/interaction etc.), demonstrated in key high impact sectors where robotics has the potential to deliver significant economic and/or societal benefits. This next step functionality should clearly delineate from state of the art solutions and can be illustrated by the following non-exhaustive examples that illustrate different types of functional ability. Proposals should address functional challenges that are of equivalent or greater complexity and/or combine different types of functions to deliver greater functional complexity:
o	To reach the point where the robot systems operating in harsh complex and dynamic working environments can carry out sequences of complex functions to achieve a functional goal.
o	For example a robot able to carry out a range of different types of functions where the choice and sequence of execution depends on the dynamics of the operating context as the task progresses.
o	In navigation to reliably and purposefully move between destinations within complex people centric environments that are occupied such as busy transport hubs, shopping malls or entertainment and sporting venues; or to move purposefully maintaining a direction of travel towards a target destination or sequence of destinations over variable terrain where the surface is shifting and reactive to the robot?s motion for example on sand, gravel or waterlogged ground; or to be able to navigate, move purposefully and transition between water and air or water and land including mixed surfaces attaining a target destination, or sequence of destinations over extended distances beyond the current state of the art.
o	In manipulation to reach human speed with equivalent dexterity, or manipulate objects beyond human capability, such as very small objects, or very precise manipulation tasks, or vary big objects, beyond current capabilities and functionalities; to manipulate complex articulated objects either as part of an assembly task or in order to use those objects as tools to achieve a specific function. For example handling a complex articulated part while a processing operation is taking place on it; or to manipulate and assemble soft objects or materials that deform under their own weight such as textiles as a part of a useful process.
?	Step change in the enabling conditions essential for the accelerated diffusion of robots in various industries, sectors and services which can 1) handle tasks efficiently, robustly, and safely and 2) interact naturally and smoothly to support humans in their daily activities, based on a strong multidisciplinary approach, including the relevant SSH dimension.
?	The development, use and exploitation of major advances in science and technology for the enhancement of European robotics, in order to maintain Europe?s scientific excellence and ensure sovereignty of key technologies relevant to robotics

?	Create opportunities to affect society in the longer term by contributing to impact on major broad societal challenges.
Scope: For robots to be usefully and efficiently deployed to perform new activities in physical interaction with the real world requires an improvement in and expansion of the range of functionalities robots can deploy.
This needs to take place in sectors where the capabilities of robots can be utilised to progress productivity in critical industries, support European industries essential for sovereignty and in sectors with high impact across Europe such as manufacturing, healthcare, agri-food, construction etc.
In particular the following major areas of functional performance need to be progressed to the next level of performance:
?	significant enhancement of navigation capabilities in order to enhance mobility (underwater, on the ground, in the air, in the body, in areas difficult to reach, on rough terrain, in unpredictable environments, in areas including people or other moving agents, etc.), particularly in highly dynamic and complex environments.
?	extension of manipulation capabilities to address:
o	large (of the order of metres to 10s of meters in scale), or heavy (of the order of 100kg to multiple 100kg )
o	or small objects of millimetre or centimetre scale, or smaller; ,
o	or of objects that are soft, deformable, articulated, delicate or hazardous objects;
Each of these require significant advances in precision, force, speed, re-planning, physical perception, grasping, manipulation (including bi-manual), etc.), in order to achieve beyond human capability in manipulation and dexterity.
For large scale manipulation applications include but are not limited to manufacturing, assembly, maintenance and installation of large infrastructure; for example wind turbines, energy pylons, pipelines, dwellings, industrial buildings, transport infrastructure etc.)
For small scale manipulation applications include but are not limited to medical and healthcare (human and animal), pharmaceutical and laboratory automation, process industries, materials processing and micro-fabrication and assembly.
?	significant enhancement of functional interaction capabilities to deliver efficient, safe and natural interaction with people, objects, with other robots, within complex and dynamic working environments, including the ability to adapt to variation in the working environment and the needs and dynamics of users, objects and structures, etc.).

Making significant next step advances in these functional capabilities will require paradigm shifts in terms of both physical and systems architecture particularly through the removal of silos between disciplines that contribute to robotics functionalities.
Proposals will need to address safety and security aspects at all levels, as well as consider the data life cycle in line with GDPR.
Proposals should aim to address bold and significant challenges to the enhancement of robot functionality and do so by utilising multidisciplinary research activities.
Proposals should address several of the following in the context of improved functional performance relevant to deployment barriers in a high impact sector:
?	Robust perception and the integration of sensing into physical structures to enhance motion and perception
?	Advanced safe and reliable navigation functionalities, integrating anticipation, re- planning, high-level goal optimisation. Natural human-robot interaction functionality
?	Advanced cognitive capabilities, integrating any type of learning (from experience, collaborative intelligence or learning from human knowledge, frugality in terms of data, unsupervised, etc.), modelling, reasoning, introspection, etc.
?	Novel design approaches, e.g. soft robotics, under-actuated, miniaturised, modular/reconfigurable robots including those capable of self-reconfiguration, e.g. for guidance/navigation/manipulations in places hard to reach
?	Mobile manipulation, natural manipulation of arbitrary objects including soft, fragile or other items complex to handle (e.g. dirty, slippery, deformable)
?	Advanced navigation/manipulation in extreme environments, extremely small and precise in the body, autonomous navigation on shifting and uneven surfaces and in transition, for example between water and air or water and land, field robotics in harsh environments, the handling and manipulation of extremely large/heavy objects, etc.
Where relevant, proposals should contribute to making AI and robotics solutions meet the requirements of Trustworthy AI, based on the respect of the ethical principles, the fundamental rights including critical aspects such as robustness, safety, reliability, in line with the European Approach to AI. Ethics principles need to be adopted from early stages of development and design.
Critical to success will be the interaction of End Users in the definition of the problem domains and use cases that act as barriers to long term deployment and uptake across multiple sectors.
Multidisciplinary research activities should address all of the following:

?	Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in the necessary relevant disciplines to reach their objectives. SSH is particularly relevant in addressing human aspects related to human-robot interaction, sensible task distribution between humans and robots, agency, control, trust and handling of data collection, to achieve usability, trustworthiness, safety and adoption of the developed solutions.
?	It is essential that scientific and technological results are reproducible and re-usable in order to contribute to the advancement of the targeted research area.
?	S&T progress should be demonstrated through use-cases with major and broad socio- economic impact.
?	Projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes.

In addition, access to space ground facilities in Europe need to become interoperable allowing to decrease the launch service costs.
In coherence with WP21-22, the activities will address one or several of the following listed domains under a) and/or b):
a.	Multi sites flexible industrial platform:

Feasibility study and maturation of key technologies in representative conditions, including cost benefits assessment of a flexible platform as a tool for existing and future European space launcher products, to enable a cost-efficient approach including existing Manufacturing Assembly Integration and Testing capabilities as design constraints, to increase economical robustness against variable production rates in the rocket industry and to optimise transfer from existing to new launcher productions.
To explore, including from other industrial sectors, the use of a value-stream mapping (including the material- and information flow) in the field of Design to Manufacturing, Integration, Maintenance and Operation capabilities including improvements based on advanced data management and Artificial Intelligence. Maturation of technologies, including for reusable parts of the launch systems.
b.	Develop standardised and cost-effective innovative technologies to improve cost efficiency of Test and Launch facilities, their interoperability and compatibility/attractiveness for new users, including one or several of the following domains:
1.	modern data handling, data processing, diagnostic techniques

2.	eco-friendly technologies,

3.	automation and innovative controls,

4.	mobile telemetry systems, mobile payload preparation facilities,

5.	security and safety

The maturation will go up to an incremental demonstration of key technologies.

In addition solutions for improving flexibility (for new actors and concepts), configurability and interoperability of European test and launch facilities, including existing operational facilities, will be address:
For launch facilities, activities shall address standards and means related to launch range, operations, communication, safety (this may also include safety equipment to be installed on- board: development and/or tests). The objective is to allow to operate multiple-launchers from different launch sites in order to minimize the impact on their definition.

For test facilities, activities shall address analysis and means with regards to flexibility for multiple/green propulsions and adaptation of engine test capacities to reach modular and smart engine test simulator.
The maturation will go up to an incremental demonstration of key technologies.

All the activities should be complementary and coherent with the ESA on-going or future activities, in particular those decided at the last ESA Ministerial held in November 2019 and planned to be decided at the ESA Ministerial planned in November 2022.

Scope: The areas of R&I are:

?	Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service evolution: the objective is to develop new and advanced modelling and data assimilation in CAMS global and regional systems in order to keep modelling and data assimilation aspects at the international state-of-the-art and benefit fully from ground-based and satellite observations, in particular from active remote-sensing networks with profiling capabilities (e.g. lidars, ceilometers, radars). In addition, new methods to advance substantially in the modelling of secondary aerosols and their interlinks with gas phase primary aerosols, as well as with gas and aqueous. With an integrated modelling approach, the integration of new observational data becomes a driver for further enhancement and improved realism of the already existing production chains, assimilation systems and coupled models. The development of advanced processing and modelling techniques, as well as the exploitation of new sources of data, will be targeted to create new products or significantly improve the quality and performances of existing elements-components for the benefit of users. The projects should take into account the existing service and clearly define to what extent the service will be improved with new elements or products, including the use of enhanced models, algorithms, tools and techniques to generate new products. The main output of the project should be tools and methodologies that can be readily transferred for improving aerosol representation in CAMS operational global and regional systems. The proposal should develop activities that will improve the quality of the aerosol variables in the CAMS global and regional analyses, forecasts and reanalyses, as well as of the CAMS solar radiation products.
?	Copernicus Climate Change Service evolution: the objective is to develop innovative methodologies to characterise compound and cascading extreme weather events, including determining the potential frequency, intensity and impacts of these events in a changing climate. The proposal should underpin the creation of tools to monitor these events, attribute them to climate variability and change and, whenever possible, project changes in their likelihood. Proposals are expected to provide tangible results (new or improved products or service elements) for the Copernicus service. The research should be performed using existing Copernicus datasets for identifying natural hazard events at continental (Europe) and global scales, and existing methods, models (including local), tools and observations available at the different Copernicus Services. Examples of high- impact weather-driven natural hazards include, but are not limited to, floods, droughts, wildfires, desert dust storms, storm surges, heatwaves. The proposed research and development should be modular and scalable and the transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Further details are highlighted in the Guidance document.
?	Research activities to develop new and innovative methods to improve the numerical requirements (accuracy, mass-conservation) for the numerical schemes in the CO2MVS system for of atmospheric CO2 and other relevant tracers in the CAMS/CO2MVS capacity to accurately estimate CO2 emissions and to improve the numerical schemes

used in the CO2MVS capacity systems based on accurate metrics. The main objective is to perform R&D activities identified as priorities for the Copernicus CO2MVS capacity as identified by the European Commission?s CO2 monitoring Task Force. The activities should support the further development of the foreseen European operational monitoring support capacity for anthropogenic CO2 emissions. These activities should complement or follow-up on the activities within the H2020-funded CO2 Human Emissions (CHE) project and the Prototype system for a Copernicus CO2 service (CoCO2) project. The activities, as described in the Guidance document, should address a series of scientific and critical system design issues, which were defined following outcomes of the CHE project and based on recommendations from the CO2 monitoring Task Force. More generally, this action should support the development of an integrated support capacity, enabling European experts to collectively share their knowledge and join forces on the multiple fronts required to develop such a system with operational capabilities. The activities should fulfil the technological and scientific requirements for the development of this European operational capacity, to further improve the prototype system to better meet user requirements and to exploit synergies with other Copernicus services.
A proposal should address only one area, which must be clearly identified.

Proposals are expected to provide tangible results (new or improved products or service elements) for the Copernicus service within the period 2021-2027. The proposed research and development should be modular and scalable and should support the automatization of different processes orchestration. The activities of the project should raise synergies towards Earth Observation Envelope Programme (ESA EOEP) and also contribute to the objectives set by the Group on Earth Observation and outcomes and relevant results of the project should be promoted also at international level through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).
The projects should provide a proof-of-concept (e.g. system element targeting TRL 5-6) at least demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service.
Additionally, the transfer of research results to operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entity of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.

Scope: The R&I area is:

Innovative methods and technologies for emergency related applications to derive advanced products and open new opportunities for an operational deployment addressing the needs of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service
Different aspects should be considered for the service evolution:

?	enhancement of an existing element or component through e.g.: technology improvements such as optimal automation of existing processes encompassing innovative artificial intelligent procedures and High Performance Computing (HPC) or adding new data streams in core services; methodological improvements such as optimised modelling tools and multi-platform, multi sensor AI techniques for automatic recognition of severe to extreme events and production of early warning indicators;
?	new elements or components to the existing (core) service;
?	new services complementing the core services and providing added functionality as required by users; e.g. in a national or regional context.
Actions aimed at service evolution should be developed in response to specific policy and user requirements while seizing the opportunities provided by the evolution in technology.
Although there is no guarantee that developments will be integrated into the operational CEMS, proposals should duly take into consideration practical aspects related to the integration of results into Copernicus services, including feasibility and cost/benefit analysis as well as timeline for technology maturity of the solutions proposed and their deployment in operational environments. Proposals should aim at reaching technology readiness level TRL6 and should include either a proof-of-concept or prototype demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service or the added-value of new elements in new application areas.

Appropriate interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entity of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation.
Proposals should build, where possible and relevant, on free and open-source models, tools and datasets already used or produced by CEMS and the software developed should be open licensed.
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for funding. The possible participation of the JRC may consist in (1) ensuring access to relevant models, tools and datasets of the operational CEMS, (2) providing a good understanding of

existing operational workflows and advice regarding the operational feasibility of new developments and (3) testing of new developments/prototypes in a pre-operational setting.
On data fusion, vast amounts of EO-data are now being available for applications in the disaster domains. Identification of complementary data sets, development and testing of new and innovative ways (if applicable also in the context of social innovation) to efficiently integrate them in emergency applications will be used to generate added value and new intelligence. Besides satellite data, additional ones include in-situ and ground-based observations and measurements, meteorological data from ground weather stations and radar, data from aerial platforms, social media or crowdsourcing, as well as information generated from other sources and other Copernicus services. Whenever appropriate, the project should take advantage from Copernicus and EGNSS synergy. Potential security threats (e.g. cybersecurity) in the data flow and sensitivity of data and service products should be duly taken into account.

Scope: The coastal zones have tremendous social, economic and biological value but are exposed to a high level of pressure due to climate change and human activities (e.g. regional sea level rise due to ice melting, coastal erosion, coastal floods, pollution, etc.). It is essential to advance Copernicus solutions to answer policy (e.g. WFD, MSFD, MSP, CFP, Flood Directive, Arctic Policy, Green Deal) needs to better manage and protect the coastal zone, to ensure the development of a sustainable blue economy (e.g. tourism, energy extraction, fisheries, offshore operations, industrial port areas, cities growth) , and to build resilience to climate change, human activities being potentially exposed and vulnerable to many hazards of natural or anthropic origins, including storm surges, flooding, acidification, ice melting, and degradation of ecosystems.
The objective is to implement an advanced and seamless monitoring and forecasting of the ocean from global/regional to coastal scales representative of high-resolution and high- dynamics phenomena (physics, biogeochemistry) to better constrain the coastal applications and models developed at national to local level for several applications. As such the project should encourage a co-production between the EU Copernicus Marine Service global/regional service and Member State and Copernicus Participating States coastal services using digital innovation and facilities (including using Copernicus DIAS if appropriate). This requires:
?	The development of improved pan-European satellite coastal observation retrievals (e.g. sea level, sea surface temperature, ocean colour, bathymetry, shoreline position, winds, waves, ice changes.), notably derived from Sentinel data, and an improved access and processing of in-situ data in the coastal zone.
?	The development of improved inputs of freshwater flows and associated river inputs of particulate and dissolved organic and mineral matter and the development of standardized methods to couple hydrological models (for river run-offs) with Copernicus Marine and coastal ocean models.

?	The development of improved coupling techniques between Copernicus Marine observations and modelling systems and downstream coastal observation and modelling systems operated by Member States and Copernicus Participating States including an impact assessment for key coastal applications (e.g. marine hazards, offshore operations, fishery and aquaculture, pollution) and EU policies (e.g. MSFD, WFP, MSP, CFP, Green Deal).
New technological tools should be considered and innovative solutions should be proposed for better data exploitation, processing and distribution, e.g. move to cloud and HPC computing, distributed computing, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (e.g. for automatic feature recognition), ensemble modelling, model coupling & nesting.

and the potential development of new state of the art products complementing the existing ones.
?	Development of a common leading-edge approach across services, and in the area of hydrological modelling serving the interests of various applications including agriculture, navigation, energy, flood prevention, and considering also hydrological climate change monitoring, assimilation of hydrological fluxes at the land-sea interface in ocean models, inland water river monitoring and forecasting (short term forecasting and climate monitoring). The development should consider cross services approaches and all relevant Copernicus service products, in particular the existing continental and global scale hydrological monitoring and forecasting systems of the Copernicus Emergency Management and Climate Change services (CEMS & C3S).
?	Development of new algorithms and processing chains (e.g. data fusion, combination, assimilation, into monitoring and forecasting models) preparing also for the use of the new types of space observation data (being from new Sentinels or other contributing missions) should also be envisaged allowing the implementation of new products or the improvement of existing products.
Scope: The areas of R&I are:

1.	the development of new and innovative methods to integrate the current land products into land surface, land use and cover change, and more sophisticated land planning and allocation models for different environment, including through cross services approaches and using all relevant Copernicus service products, and thus extending the potential limited uptake of land product into land planning decisions, offering new dimensions and new interests for Copernicus land products. In addition, the project should demonstrate the added value of Copernicus land service products when they are integrated and/or assimilated into the models.
2.	the development of an integrated, harmonized and coherent product provision system making use of new and innovative methods and observations (e.g.; SWOT mission) to improve the portfolio of the current inland and coastal/shore hydrological satellite observation products with more sophisticated and/or new products, in order to improve global scale hydrological monitoring and forecasting. The development should consider cross services approaches and all relevant Copernicus service products. It should extend the uptake (incl. assimilation) of inland water satellite observation product into hydrological models, consider a consistent approach to hydrological modelling for different purposes (e.g. continental water monitoring under climate change, improved flood and drought forecasting, support to water applications in sectors such as agriculture and energy, forcing coastal models) and offering new dimensions and new interests for Copernicus land, inland and coastal water products. In addition, the project should demonstrate the added value of Copernicus water satellite observation products when they are integrated and/or assimilated into models based on scientific quality validation approaches.

A proposal should address only one area, which must be clearly identified.

The projects should take into account the existing services and clearly define to what extent the services will be improved with new elements or products, including the use of enhanced models, algorithms, tools and techniques to generate new product(s). The projects should build, where possible and relevant, on open-source models, tools and datasets already used or produced by the existing Copernicus services.
Proposals are expected to provide tangible results (new or improved products or service elements) for the Copernicus service. The proposed research and development should be modular and scalable and should support the automatization of different processes orchestration. The project should provide a proof-of-concept (e.g. system element targeting TRL5-6) at least demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service. The activities of the project should also contribute to the objectives set by the Group on Earth Observation and outcomes and relevant results of the project should be promoted also at international level through the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).
Additionally, the transfer of research results to possible operations should receive active attention during the project to strengthen the readiness for an operational deployment in the future. Appropriate interaction with the relevant Entrusted Entity of the Copernicus services, the conditions for making available, for re-using and exploiting the results (including IPR) by the said entities must be addressed during the project implementation. Software should be open licensed.

?	Integration of the Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) and Earth Observation data analytics with a variety of other application-specific data sources like data from remote sensors accessed through IOT, as well as crow-sourced data, high velocity transnational data and social media posts.
Scope: Copernicus Security Services provide, today, a valuable contribution to civil security, law enforcement operations and crisis management in Europe as well as in support to its external actions. Technology and space capacities have been evolving significantly, creating opportunities for an increased outreach across a broader spectrum of related applications.
Member states are also calling to reinforce Copernicus to better contribute to resilience and security in support to civil security and to better react and recover from major upcoming crisis of various forms, such as population displacement due conflicts, impact of climate change or extreme weather phenomena at global or regional levels. Copernicus has to potential to become a major contributor to European Data spaces that play an important role for security solutions. The Commission is as well anticipating on these needs and considering developing an enlarged portfolio of resilient services addressing new threats, for governmental use and complementary to national end existing EU capacities.
R&D activities should therefore support an increase in service performance, outreach and scope, aiming particularly at fostering:
?	Innovative methods and technologies to explore new and enlarged data sets and the development of applications addressing requirements not currently tackled by the current services.
?	Actions in support to the evolution and scope of the security services, namely increasing user reach, responding to specific regional needs and increasing service added value in user operational scenarios.
More detailed information and guidelines will be provided in the Strategic Research Agenda for Copernicus Security Services[1] (SRA-CSS V1.0, to be released end 2022).
Actions aimed at service evolution will have to be developed in response to specific policy and user requirements at European, Regional or National level, possibly making also use of data generated by any of the other Copernicus services, whenever relevant. .
Proposals shall be explicit with regard to heir relevance on (1) the complementary of service provision, namely in terms of added-value, users, service portfolio, policies or data sets or (2) the added-value of the integration of results into Copernicus core services. As such, they should include feasibility and cost/benefit analysis, as well as a timeline for deployment in operational environments and a proof-of-concept or prototype demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service or the added-value of elements targeting new application areas.
Attention should be paid to elements enabling R&D spin-out to operational environments, such as the need to re-use and exploit the results (including IPR) to the entities implementing

the EU Copernicus programme. Resulting products, software in particular, should be open licensed allowing it to be installed, copied and adapted to the operational environment it will be intended for.
Proposers are advised to exploit all possible synergies with other security specific actions funded under the work programme of Cluster 3 ?Civil security for society?.
Proposals are expected to provide tangible impact (new or improved products or service elements) for the period 2025-2027. As such, preference will be given to proposals with service elements e.g. system element targeting at least TRL 5-6. demonstrating the feasibility of the integration in the existing core service or the development of new, complementary elements.

?	Strengthen the base for industry-academia collaboration in the higher education institutions in the European Union and Associated Countries and help fostering skills addressing industry and public sector needs;
?	Facilitate industry and SMEs to capitalise on the diversity of R&I talents, skills and cultures across the European Union and Associated Countries and spread novel approaches for industry-academia-public sector co-creation in cross-border manner;
?	Boost valorisation of excellent research results and innovation, i.e. transforming them into sustainable solutions with economic and social value.
Scope: There is a clear need to improve industry-academia interactions in Europe 317 and enhance knowledge valorisation318 in innovation ecosystems. The role of intermediaries, e.g. industry clusters, science and innovation parks which can provide a collaboration platform and facilitate co-creation is relevant in this context. Methodologies for improved industry- academia co-creation through expert facilitation offer possibilities for higher education institutions to better meet the needs for innovation from the industry, business side and public sector. The diverse pool of R&I talents at the higher education institutions across Europe constitutes a vast source for creativity which should be fully capitalised for innovation.319

Scope: The new Industrial Strategy targets place-based innovation with broad stakeholder engagement. The European knowledge valorisation policy places much attention on a more diverse societal engagement involving a multitude of participants to create value through innovation benefiting all of society.
Enabling systemic change and achieving the twin transition cannot be achieved by technological solutions alone, if these solutions are not accepted and fully used by society, or if they increase existing inequalities. Engagement with the arts and cultural institutions can increase citizens? understanding of complex issues (such as climate change, crisis management, data, artificial intelligence etc.) and involve citizens in co-creation for solutions drawing on existing knowledge and research results and driven by art and technology. Strengthening approaches of experimentation and creativity common in the ways artistic and cultural interactions operate, in co-creation with citizens and industry, can increase the potential for transformation towards a more prosperous, inclusive and innovative future.
This action aims to strengthen and further develop existing or new schemes promoting arts- industrial technologies-citizens interactions, that increase uptake of new technologies and innovative solutions through better societal understanding and acceptance, as well as co- creation delivering economic and societal benefits. While arts and technology are the main drivers, citizens and communities are empowered to develop, test, co-create and share the benefits of new innovative solutions that address their needs. Industry is stimulated to adopt more human-centred and creative approaches, enhanced by interactions with citizens, artists, designers, social and humanities scientists, cultural and creative professionals and institutions.
The proposals will address at least one of the following challenges:

?	Developing and testing new schemes, initiatives and modes for arts-industrial technologies-citizens interactions leading to increased uptake of research results and innovative solutions by market and society. At least 20 new schemes and initiatives across Europe will be tested;
?	Transferring, with the appropriate adaptations, and testing in another environment, existing schemes, initiatives and modes for arts-industrial technologies-citizens interactions that increase uptake of research results and innovative solutions by market and society. At least 20 existing (or recent) schemes and initiatives will be tested in a different member state to where they are in place/ originate, across Europe",
HORIZON-CL4-2023-HUMAN-01-51, Pilots for an innovative human-centric industry (RIA),3/29/2023,RIA,12/1/2022,,,Around 10.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Improved understanding of the socio-technical and ethical implications of advanced (digital) technologies for workers and work organisation across industrial sectors;
?	Work and learning environments and work models that make best use of the possibilities of advanced (digital) technologies and the human capabilities and creative potential in a synergistic manner, thus contributing to enhanced European industrial competitiveness in existing and new markets;
?	A skilled and creative industry workforce that is empowered through and in control of advanced technologies that are aligned with European social and ethical values.
Scope: Digitalisation and automation in industry to date have focussed primarily on capitalising on opportunities to increase efficiency and enhance productivity, often without much attention to the changing role of the worker. In its Industry 5.0 concept, the Commission puts forward a view of a resilient, sustainable and human-centric industry. The human-centric approach implies placing core human needs and interests at the heart of processes in industry, rather than taking the technology and its potential for increasing efficiency as a starting point.
A human-centric industry recognises and leverages the capabilities and creative potential of its workers through the synergistic combination with advanced (digital) technologies. In this process, with regard to work organisation, work place design, work content and skills, working conditions and work relations, fundamental principles and human needs such as human autonomy and control, coherence and variation of tasks, work-life balance, social dialogue and others, must be safeguarded, as well as human rights 321 such as privacy and

321	The Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union

safety. Moreover, as diverse groups of workers experience the increasing impact ? as well as opportunities - of the digital transition, upskilling or reskilling is required to meet the digital transformation challenges of the enterprise.
The project will develop and demonstrate the concept of human-centricity in a real-life, operational industrial environment in at least ten pilots. A pilot may consist of an individual company, but may also span multiple companies that interact across (possibly transnational) value chains or in a local innovation ecosystem. The set of pilots, as a whole, will cover a variety of industrial sectors and company sizes, including SMEs and start-ups and/or scale- ups, and will be situated in at least 13 different EU Member States or countries associated to the Horizon Europe programme.
The pilots will innovate and go beyond-the-state-of-the-art with respect to the purposeful application of advanced technologies, which would typically be situated at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 or 7. With regard to digital solutions, the aspect of cyber-security must be adequately addressed in design, implementation and governance. Purposeful application signifies that innovation is expected that promotes a human-centric industry and may imply, as appropriate, innovation with respect to work organisation, tasks and functions of workers, skills and training, occupational health and safety, enterprise management and governance (incl. the management of human resources), business models, corporate values and ethics, etc.
In addition, the pilots may address particular themes such as the ones listed hereunder in a non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive manner:
?	the development of and experimentation with models and technologies to stimulate individual and collective creativity of workers and future workforce,
?	the participation of workers (as end-users) in the design of purposeful technology application in the work process,
?	the application of technology to enhance the inclusivity of the work environment, the ways in which unskilled or low-skilled labour participate in a human-centric production process and the role of technology therein,
?	how technological, process and organisational innovation can offer jobs that remain rewarding for the individual worker along the life cycle,
?	the development of and experimentation with the use of advanced technologies (such as robotics) in learning environments to increase the skill level of the current and future workforce,
?	the response to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the organisation of work and its effects.
The project will report the obtained results and the practices leading to success, as well as the encountered difficulties and bottlenecks  and any trade-off that had to be made. They will

identify and analyse direct and indirect effects and outcomes of the pilots. These include effects and outcomes that pertain to workers? satisfaction and well-being, with a particular interest for the acceptance of and relation with technology. Equally important are the effects and outcomes that implicate the competitiveness and resilience of the company and, taking a wider perspective, the societal role of industry as responsible provider of prosperity. The consortia will interpret their findings in a coherent theoretical framework, exploiting the diversity of the pilots and taking into account the specificities of the setting and context of the pilots.
The consortium will formulate evidence-based recommendations tailored to relevant stakeholders, including, as appropriate, policy makers at relevant levels (EU, national/regional, sectoral), social partners, industry federations and professional associations and partnerships and organised civil society (NGOs). A concluding conference will support this goal.
This topic requires an interdisciplinary approach with the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and/or institutions.
The proposals should consider the intersectional gender dimension in the content of the proposed research and innovation, in order to deliver scientific quality and societal relevance of the produced knowledge and innovation.
Proposers should consider and actively seek synergies with relevant active and finalised projects/activities in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe 322 (including public-private and public-public partnerships323 and EIT KICs) and the Digital Europe programme (European Digital Innovation Hubs), as well as within relevant sectorial associations324",

?	Increased uptake of the Industry 5.0 principles and practices across industrial sectors, achieved through improved understanding of its benefits for enterprises and society and actionable knowledge about factors of success and impediment;
?	Sound data and analysis of the uptake of Industry 5.0 in its different dimensions for policy makers at EU, national/regional and sectoral level.
Scope: In January 2021, the Commission articulated, under the name Industry 5.0325, a vision of a future-proof industry that, capitalising on technological progress beyond productivity and efficiency, is the resilient provider of prosperity, within planetary boundaries and placing the wellbeing of the worker at the centre.
In order to optimise policies that stimulate the uptake of the Industry 5.0 principles of sustainability, resilience and human-centricity and facilitate their implementation, an increased understanding of drivers and factors contributing to or hindering successful implementation is required, based on a sociotechnical and multidisciplinary approach, taking technological, social and human aspects into consideration.
The action will select and thoroughly study the successful or less successful implementation of the Industry 5.0 principles in at least ten cases. Each case is in a different EU Member State or country associated to the Horizon Europe programme. Cases may be cross-boundary. These cases may be complemented with other cases. If a case in a country outside the EU or
325	https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and- innovation/industry-50_en

in a country not associated to the Horizon Europe programme would be proposed, its relevance must be demonstrated in the proposal. The overall design of the study must be well deliberated, founded in a coherent theoretical framework, and provide for a careful selection of cases (for instance, by variation of relevant case characteristics such as company size and type, industrial sector, country typology, etc.) and for a framework of analysis that can be applied consistently across cases. The smart study design should enable the consortium to extract maximal and relevant insights from the combined analysis of the selected cases.
Taking into account and exploiting the specificities of the cases, the deep analysis of the individual cases, together with the combined analysis of the cases, will address the following research themes in an evidence-based manner.
?	Implementation practices: How do companies, local innovation ecosystems or industry sectors implement Industry 5.0 principles in practice? Which modes of implementation exist? How does industry go beyond the state-of-the-art and innovate, for instance with respect to the purposeful application of technology, work organisation and production, organisation and operation of supply chains, worker tasks and functions, training and skills, human resources management, sustainable business models and resilient value chains, long-term value creation, corporate governance, climate transition and sustainability plans, stakeholder engagement, partnerships and networks, etc.?
?	Drivers: What are the drivers for companies, industry sectors or industrial ecosystems to adapt (or not) Industry 5.0 principles? Which trade-offs may have to be made? Which role do public policies and regulatory environment play? How does successful implementation of Industry 5.0 principles provide advantage on multiple dimensions such as (global) competitiveness, reputation, attractiveness for talent and for investment, enhanced generation of qualified jobs, adaptive capacity to incremental changes and sudden disruptions (e.g. by reduction of dependencies), progress towards climate change objectives, etc.?
?	Success factors and bottlenecks: What are the factors, either internal or external to the company, that contribute or hinder the uptake and implementation of Industry 5.0 principles? How do workers accept and relate to advanced technology in the work place? What is the role of the embedding of a company in the local community? What are the factors that could diminish or reinforce inequalities through the implementation of advanced technologies in the work place? What is the added value of considering sustainability aspects, including science-based targets, in defining the business strategy?
?	SMEs/start-ups/scale-ups: How can/do SMEs/start-ups/scale-ups take up Industry 5.0 principles and what is the role of the local innovation ecosystem in this? How does it help these types of enterprises to participate successfully in the green and digital transition of industry?
?	Measurement: The project will investigate state-of-the-art quantitative and qualitative tools for measuring progress towards Industry 5.0 in its three dimensions of resilience, sustainability and human-centricity and how they can be applied in practice.

Proposers are encouraged to elaborate the above research themes further with a view to contributing fully to the expected outcomes. Proposers will explain and motivate the trade-off made between number and representativeness of study cases and breadth and depth of analysis.
The analysis must go beyond mere desk research and must be developed and validated in interaction with the actors involved in the respective cases. A number of workshops involving external experts, including from within the Commission, will support this goals
The project will transfer knowledge in actionable form to relevant actors including policy makers, social partners and industry federations and partnerships, organised civil society (NGOs). A concluding conference will support this goal.
This topic requires an interdisciplinary approach with the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts and/or institutions.
The proposals will devote attention to the gender dimension in the content of the proposed research and innovation, in order to deliver scientific quality and societal relevance of the produced knowledge and innovation.

?	Human-centric and participatory approaches to enhance wider engagement and creativity, with appropriate contributions from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), including cognitive science;
?	Raising the profile of manufacturing as an attractive career option;
?	Improved access to flexible production capabilities in decentralised environments, especially for SMEs.
Scope: Decentralised, local and urban manufacturing is characterised by small, versatile factories, close to customers, and to highly qualified workers, where various types of customised products are produced in small series for the cost price of mass-produced products.
The New European Bauhaus seeks a transformation relying on industrial ecosystems, from construction to lifestyle and creative industries, from materials to business models, from digital to farming, to provide tailored and affordable solutions. The New European Bauhaus approaches innovation not only in the sense of new technologies but also as a combination of new and traditional techniques, or adaptations of local crafts and knowledge. This topic is intended to integrate the New European Bauhaus initiative into the development and implementation of the decentralised manufacturing vision. New business models and social economy approaches, and Design for Sustainability, can also support the decentralised manufacturing vision.
New technologies offer the possibility of implementing certain manufacturing processes in localised and urban settings, limiting time to reach the job place for workers, bringing production closer to, and responding to the needs of customers and consumers, and promoting urban resilience and inclusiveness. The focus is on designing and prototyping urban and decentralised processes, not on large-scale adoption by manufacturing industry. However, attention to standards is required, to ensure that the urban and decentralised segments can be integrated in wider manufacturing processes.
Research and Innovation activities should cover:

?	Adaptation (and where relevant development) of green and digital technologies that allow production in local and urban contexts with lower environmental impacts, noise, waste, energy and space consumption, and an increased quality of experience.

?	Consideration of the potential of circular economy approaches, by closing the material and energy cycles in cities and transforming waste streams into productive resources.
?	Activities for developing skills and creativity; participatory design strategies; inclusiveness, possibly including unemployed workforce and marginalised groups; and engaging citizens in the definition of challenges and solutions.
?	Artistic experimentation with novel uses of technologies that help push for green solutions in the spirit of S+T+ARTS (starts.eu) and New European Bauhaus, also taking into consideration the different dimensions of inclusion and aesthetics and quality of experience.
Digitally-enabled solutions that support the local and urban manufacturing vision may be considered. Possible technology development includes the adoption of artificial intelligence and smart data approaches to control and optimise distributed manufacturing and logistic processes; Internet of Things solutions and big data analysis to reach zero-defect manufacturing processes and zero-surprises predictive maintenance; distributed ledger technologies to reduce transaction costs.
Developed technologies should be demonstrated in at least two complementary use cases. To achieve this, project consortia may provide financial support to SMEs in the form of Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP). The maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 100 000, with up to one third of the total EU contribution used for FSTP.
A human-centric approach should be integrated, with appropriate contributions from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), and in particular the arts as catalysts of human compatible and green uses of technology (see S+T+ARTS) in transdisciplinary approaches. As part of this, a strategy for skills development should could be included, associating social partners where relevant.
All projects should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. In particular, projects can consider links to the EU Mission Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities,329 and to one or more of the 100 EU Cities that will participate.330
Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus initiative by interacting with the New European Bauhaus Community, NEBLab and other relevant actions of the initiative through sharing information, best practice and, where relevant, results.

?	Reinforcing the links between standardisation and research and innovation in circular value chains, ensuring that standardisation facilitates cross-sector interoperability at all levels.
?	Facilitating the market entry of innovative solutions, which could aid the circularity of resources and zero pollution.
?	Identifying the major bottlenecks for standardisation related framework conditions to support industrial symbiosis.
?	In order to support the implementation of the ERA Industrial technology roadmap for low carbon technologies333, helping the development of agile and green standards to ensure interoperability in the domain of industrial symbiosis.
Scope: As emphasised in the European Green Deal and in the New Industrial Strategy for Europe, developing new standards, coupled with increased EU participation in international standardisation bodies, will be essential to boost industry?s competitiveness and build a sustainable and more inclusive future.
This action will identify solutions on how standardisation can allow stakeholders at all levels develop a shared understanding of processes by which waste or by?products of an industry or industrial process become the raw materials for another.
The action will cover manufacturing and process industries in a wider context taking into consideration waste treatment and management, energy use and materials sourcing. It will evaluate the impact of industrial symbiosis on the environment and strengthen the link between environmental science and policymaking. In this multidisciplinary approach standards have a key role as they reduce the multiplicity of approaches, terminologies, measurements allowing for accurate benchmarking and target setting.
The selected project may benefit from being addressed by a consortium that includes a variety of stakeholders covering, inter alia, industry, energy, environment and SSH.

This action aims at providing for a robust and sustainable pool of European professionals ready to contribute to standardisation and support positioning EU as global standard-setter. University/HEI teaching is key to build up the pool of standardisation experts. Academics teaching can provide for standardisation-competent graduates, who are aware of the benefits of standardisation and thus ready, as young professionals, to make Europe?s voice heard in international standardisation.
Those teachers of EU universities/HEI, who already integrate standardisation-related content in their lectures, should team up and, in co-operation with industry, design an innovative teaching concept of standardisation. This concept should cover the standardisation under IEC, ISO and ITU lead; update students on the highly decentralised, global ICT-related standardisation (fora and consortia); and address the technical and societal facets of standardisation (multidisciplinary orientation). The teaching concept has the mission to bridge between these two standardisation domains as well as integrate the aspects of a human-centric standardisation and the EU core values. This concept should foster the development of green and digital skills and underline the respective support through standardisation.
Based on this concept, content modules should be developed for direct and distant teaching. Both, the teaching concept and the modules should be shared with universities/HEI which are ready to include, for the first time, standardisation-content in their teaching offer.
Promotion actions should be designed in order to increase the visibility of standardisation in EU academia/HEI; here ?Academic Standardisation Days? and ?Students? Standardisation Association(s)? should be considered as practical realisations.
Proposals should involve appropriate expertise in Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), in particular in sociology, political science, economy and philosophy, to achieve an academic teaching that covers the different types of impact of standardization including the human- centred approach and compliance with the European core values.

The Report analyses their different needs and challenges. In particular, the Report assesses the relevance of standardisation in each ecosystem and proposes specific actions to overcome existing barriers in the Single Market.
The action should cover the coordination/execution of pre-normative research activities in the various ecosystems with a view to exploit synergies among the stakeholders. The scope is to boost the interactions between research projects and pre-normative work in the various ecosystems, and to increase the European contribution and presence in the subsequent formal European and international standardisation processes in line with the objectives of the standardisation strategy that was published by the Commission on 2 February 2022 [COM(2022) 31 final]. Within the standardisation processes particular attention should be dedicated on establishing interoperability standards for data sharing within and across the ecosystems, through the implementation of the FAIR data principles337 and leveraging on already adopted practices especially those in the relevant European common data spaces and in the European Research infrastructures.
Additionally, a strategy for education and skills development within the ecosystems should be developed, associating social partners when relevant.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.

The action should build on or seek collaboration with existing projects and develop synergies with other relevant European, national or regional initiatives, funding programmes and platforms. In particular, the resulting CSAs should ensure a sensible coverage within their domains and strive towards international cooperation, especially with the international standardisation organisations ISO, IEC and ITU, and similar organisations such as OECD",

Proposals should address novel AI methods and training data provision processes, aiming at high quality and reliable AI while minimizing the data needs and manipulations, targeting smart and dynamic end-to-end automation of AI training in the cloud-edge computing continuum, where AI training, AI deployment and data collection/preparation happens at the most appropriate level of the cloud-edge continuum. This will lead to better quality of AI by smart data selection/harvesting/preparation and reduces the need to collect, store, process and transfer large amounts of data and/or large AI models, while reducing energy consumption.
Proposals should address at least one of the following focus areas:

?	automated and AI-based mining, harvesting, selection, cleaning, annotation, and/or enrichment/augmentation of data for AI; generating and using synthetic data to reduce the need for large volumes of real and potentially sensitive data; validating the efficiency of these processes in AI systems;
?	lighter, less data-intensive and less energy-consuming AI models, optimized learning processes that require less input (data efficient AI) without degrading the quality of the output; machine learning methods and architectures that deal with lower volumes such as transfer learning; one-shot learning; continuous and/or lifelong learning.
Proposals should clearly mention which of the two areas will be their main focus area.

The work should contribute to increasing data efficiency and energy efficiency of AI, and rationalize the provision of data for AI. The work should support appropriate AI paradigms (central, distributed, dynamic, hybrid), responding and adapting easily to the needs of the use situation, and to the changing characteristics, availability and use conditions for data.

Target AI systems should be appropriately evaluated, and results analysed and fed back to ensure continuous improvement of the ?data for AI? pipeline.

Proposals should build on the outcomes achieved in the first phase of InDiCo, as well as in the experience gained and the studies and action that have been implemented.
Due to the strategic importance for the EU interests, proposals should include European experts on standardisation, with excellent knowledge of the European Standardisation Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) and their international activities.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Expertise in SSH is important in the context of this project to defending EU values and ethics and supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Proposals should address the following key tasks:

the digital realm including the take up of those standards by digital actors and in particular those developing new digital environment (e.g. data scientists, start-ups, investors)
?	Formulate a list of recommendations and roadmaps to address current gaps or issues that are preventing the development of digital solutions that will reinforce - and not undermine - digital humanism across the society
?	Propose a concrete framework for measuring and promoting progress of the promotion and putting into practice of the digital rights and principles declaration in the context of the Digital Decade policy programme. This will include concrete indicators, source of information at national and European level, as well as the identification of existing, and development of new, capacity tools to support the uptake of identified best practice uses of digital technologies in support of digital humanism. This work will notably feed the review of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and of the solemn declaration in 2026.
Scope: A horizontal and holistic approach is needed for creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to opportunities, societal changes, threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing protection and high-quality public services such as health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions.
While digital technologies bring strong advantages coming along with a promise of freedom and innovation, negative aspects have also become visible in the last years. These include the monopolization of the information space, increasing levels of fake news and disinformation, strong power of online platforms, cyber threats and crimes, privacy breaches, strong market disparities as well as an economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales (Zuboff, 2019).
Digital Humanism is here defined as the continuing search for a European answer to keep up high civilization standards stemming from enlightenment and the humanist era, and to further develop them in the digital world. In line with European values, such a digital environment should enable all Europeans to make full use of digital and technologies, to have a society where geographical distance matters less, so that all Europeans can benefit from the digitalisation in their daily activities (ranging from work, learning, to enjoying culture or leisure activities) but also in their interactions with governments, and participation in democratic processes.
This requires intense, cross-disciplinary work of computer (and technology) sciences with legal, economic, sociological, philosophical and other kinds of expertise as a co-development exercise. To support in-depth, early-on collaboration between computer sciences and the whole wealth of humanities and social sciences to put new algorithms and models into a broader context, proposals under this topic should:

?	Support the development of cross-disciplinary communities and networks in relation to digital transformation of society. It is thus critical to foster greater exchanges between social sciences and technological communities.
?	Support the cross-disciplinary co-development of new theoretical models and approaches of the impact of digital technologies in our societies, starting with human and societal needs.
?	Showcasing success stories and examples of engagement of the digital community seeking to develop concrete ways to progress toward a more human-centred digital world and draw concrete conclusions from these.
?	Mapping out collaborative research to develop concrete tools and frameworks for ensuring that all actors of the European digital ecosystem (policy makers, business, startup developers, investors, NGOs) can integrate in their work and activities the values that form a human centred digital transformation and develop a roadmap for the possible development of research activities
?	Develop a conceptual framework as well as tools and indicators to monitor and promote the progress of the ?declaration on digital rights and principles? and its six chapters (putting people at the centre of the digital transformation; solidarity and inclusion; freedom of choice; participation in the digital public space; safety, security and empowerment; sustainability), notably to feed the review of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and of the solemn declaration in 2026.
This project is also relevant in the policy context of the Digital Decade policy programme (?The Path to the Digital Decade?), which sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership. For the first time, societal and human centred objectives are fully integrated into a comprehensive governance mechanism at EU level including monitoring of the progress made by the digital transformation in reaching our collective values and quantitative digital targets (skills, infrastructures, digitalisation of business and public services).",

?	Art-driven development and use of human compatible Artificial Intelligence (AI) in spirit of the EC communication on ?Trustworthy AI?
?	Art-driven applications of high-performance computing (visualisation, simulation etc).
?	Art as a catalyst for uptake of the digital in society and economy in the spirit of digital innovation hubs.
?	Art-driven use of technology to facilitate the Green Transition and contribute to UN Sustainable Development goals in the spirit of the ?New European Bauhaus? (urban development, green manufacturing, circular economy, water management, etc.)
?	Art-driven use of digital media to fight disinformation, for example to promote factual narratives and change behaviour in context of Green Transition and climate change.
o	b. Continuation of the annual S+T+ARTS prize: Achieve visibility of successful art and technology collaborations via an annual prize (FSTP in form of prizes) in two categories - to be defined by proposers, organize annual calls (launch, evaluation) and disseminate the prizes and its winners in an award ceremony and a travelling exhibition
o	c. Organise an annual AI and music S+T+ARTS Festival. The festival will highlight synergies of digital ? in particular AI - with human creativity in art and music. Artistic use of digital can push limits of digital technology and is considered a measure of compatibility of digital with human values and needs.
Scope: While Europe is strongly pushing innovation based on technological and scientific progress, it has always put social and ecological priorities on the same level as economic growth. This has led to a new alliance of the arts with S&T as part of a European innovation policy rooted in values and culture. Artists become key drivers of ?art-driven innovation? towards ecologically conscious and human compatible technologies. In this spirit, DG CONNECT launched S+T+ARTS - innovation at the nexus of Science, Technology and the ARTS ? and the European Commission president proposed the ?New European Bauhaus?, where synergies between art and novel technologies are identified as enablers of the Green Transition. The present call will thus encourage actors in R&I to adopt artistic experimentation as a complementary method for technology development and use across all EC programs.

?	Enhanced robustness, performance and reliability of AI systems, including awareness of the limits of operational robustness of the system
?	Improved explainability and accountability, transparency and autonomy of AI systems, including awareness of the working conditions of the system
Scope: Trustworthy AI solutions, need to be robust, safe and reliable when operating in real- world conditions, and need to be able to provide adequate, meaningful and complete explanations when relevant, or insights into causality, account for concerns about fairness, be

robust when dealing with such issues in real world conditions, while aligned with rights and obligations around the use of AI systems in Europe. Advances across these areas can help create human-centric AI375, which reflects the needs and values of European citizens and contribute to an effective governance of AI technologies.
To achieve robust and reliable AI, novel approaches are needed to develop methods and solutions that work under other than model-ideal circumstances, while also having an awareness when these conditions break down. To achieve trustworthiness, AI system should be sufficiently transparent and capable of explaining how the system has reached a conclusion in a way that it is meaningful to the user, while also indicating when the limits of operation have been reached.
The purpose is to advance AI-algorithms that can perform safely under a common variety of circumstances, reliably in real-world conditions and predict when these operational circumstances are no longer valid. The research should aim at advancing robustness and explainability for a generality of solutions, while leading to an acceptable loss in accuracy and efficiency, and with known verifiability and reproducibility. The focus is on extending the general applicability of explainability and robustness of AI-systems by foundational AI and machine learning research. To this end, the following methods may be considered but are not necessarily restricted to:
?	data-efficient learning, transformers, reinforcement learning, federated and edge- learning, automated machine learning, or any combination thereof for improved robustness and explainability.
?	hybrid approaches integrating learning, knowledge and reasoning, model-based approaches, neuromorphic computing, or other nature-inspired approaches and other forms of hybrid combinations which are generically applicable to robustness and explainability.
?	continual learning, active learning, long-term learning and how they can help improve robustness and explainability.
?	multi-modal learning, natural language processing, speech recognition and text understanding taking multicultural aspects into account for the purpose of increased operational robustness and the capability to explain alternative formulation376.

Scope: The EU and its Member States have invested massively in Earth Observation (EO), for example with the Copernicus Programme, the development of climate and Earth System Models (ESMs), and their contribution to the implementation of Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS), which are yielding unprecedented volumes of data. This topic aims at spurring the exploitation of these assets through advanced data technologies, including artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning or explainability, or new statistical approaches based on the cooperation between ?big data? engineers, EO specialists and climate scientists.
Actions should create new insights in key processes of the Earth system and improve climate predictions based on advanced exploitation of EO data and their appropriate integration in existing or new data assimilation or modelling approaches. The activities should also lead to improved evaluation tools to facilitate the analysis of ESMs by developing new process- oriented diagnostics to better understand remaining biases and drifts, or unresolved processes or coupling in models, and improve model parameterisation and tuning. Actions should develop new tools or approaches to increase the efficiency (i.e. speed) in analysing model outputs to facilitate the study of such vast amounts of data. Actions should also distil more tailored, usable and reliable information from models and observations for assessing risks caused by extreme weather and climate events in Europe in the coming decades and contribute to an improved detection of climate change on varying space and time scales.

?	New or improved models for climate predictions or projections, which take into account climate-related potential tipping points and their impacts and are relevant for major assessments like those of the IPCC and IPBES.

?	Better understanding of potential compound or cascading effects on climate, ecosystems and society as a consequence of crossing specific tipping points.
?	Increased capacity to identify unknown tipping elements and early warning signals when a tipping point is approached.
?	Contribution to mitigation policies with view to the Paris Agreement and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, taking into account the precautionary principle, with respect to abrupt responses, hysteresis and other non-linear behaviour of the Earth system.
?	Input to adaptation strategies for the most affected regions, globally, addressing the risks of crossing climatic tipping points and related impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity.
Scope: Elements of the Earth system, including ecosystems, can suffer relatively rapid transitions in response to small changes in forcings, a process known as crossing a tipping point. Such transitions are often irreversible: the system does not return to its original state even when the forcing that caused it is brought back to its original value. The transition to a new state would have a high (even catastrophic) impact across multiple regions, physical processes, ecosystems and biodiversity, and should therefore be avoided (in line with the EU?s biodiversity strategy for 2030). Some of these tipping points may have already been crossed or have a high probability of being crossed during this century, like those caused in the ocean by warming, acidification and deoxygenation. Early warning signals, reversibility, hysteresis and resilience should be addressed through appropriate analysis methods. Mitigation pathways and safe operating spaces for humanity should be assessed and communicated to targeted audiences.
The ability and/or sensitivity of global Earth system models (ESM) to simulate tipping point crossings and other non-linear behaviour requires solid process understanding, firmly rooted in observational evidence, including from paleo-records. These processes need to be correctly represented in ESMs. The probability and impact of tipping point crossings and abrupt system changes need to be better quantified for a sound risk analysis (including aspects of irreversibility), addressing for example impacts on agriculture, fisheries, or health. Further, the approach to and crossing of tipping points lead to a loss of ecosystem resilience, causing a compounding effect in ecosystems already stressed due to non-climatic factors, and the potential for cascading impacts across trophic webs and ecosystems.
Projects should build on the results of and cooperate with, past and ongoing scientific research related to tipping points, abrupt ecosystems change and potential mitigation and adaptation strategies at global and regional levels.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-03, Climate impacts of a hydrogen economy,4/18/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: The objective of this topic is to achieve greater understanding among policy makers and stakeholders of the climate impact of large-scale deployment of hydrogen as an energy carrier or industrial feedstock, and options for addressing it. This will inform policy makers in the context of the European Green Deal, as well as alerting actors in the private sector to the environmental risks, including water and land use, opportunities and co- benefits associated with a hydrogen economy.
Actions are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	A rigorous assessment of the behaviour of hydrogen in the oxidizing cycles of the atmosphere related to methane, water vapour, carbon monoxide and ozone.
?	A rigorous assessment of the ways in which large-scale production, distribution and use of hydrogen (e.g. as an energy carrier or industrial feedstock) can affect anthropogenic radiative forcing.
?	Better monitoring tools (methodologies and instruments) for detecting and quantifying hydrogen leakage (in situ or through remote sensing).

In each case, it will be necessary to consider direct and indirect radiative forcing, both from hydrogen (e.g. potential leakages) and from other forcers associated with, or displaced by, its production, its transport and consumption.
Scope: Successful consortia should conduct all of the following activities:

?	To provide a better knowledge in order to achieve deeper and more precise understanding of the overall mechanisms driving the hydrogen cycle and its future development under concentrations higher than historically observed (with a specific focus on hydrogen sink processes).
?	Thorough analysis of the radiative forcing impacts of hydrogen, specifically by investigating the mechanistic interactions of hydrogen with tropospheric gases, in particular methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and the potential to increase atmospheric water vapour.
?	Assessment of all of the following aspects:
?	Direct and indirect effects in the atmosphere and their environmental implications (e.g. on the ozone layer).
?	The potential of systems, technologies and markets associated with large-scale hydrogen deployment to alter atmospheric hydrogen concentrations.
?	The channels through  which large-scale deployment of hydrogen could reduce global warming (e.g. by replacing fossil fuels or storing energy to balance intermittent sources of renewables).
?	The channels through which large-scale deployment of hydrogen could contribute to global warming (e.g. through leakages in the supply chain, efficiency of production and conversion processes, creation of a market for natural gas, decommissioning, displacement of other low carbon technologies).
?	Options for mitigating any global warming risks associated with hydrogen deployment (e.g. through leakage detection technologies).
Proposals are also invited to:

?	Identify any significant non-climate co-benefits or side effects of hydrogen deployment (e.g. on air soil and water quality, as well as water resource availability).
?	Consider the extent to which the risks of climate impacts from hydrogen deployment vary between different uses (e.g. energy, industry, transport).
?	Consider opportunities for mitigating such risks.
?	Disseminate their findings to relevant stakeholders such as national public authorities and the European Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-04, Improved knowledge in cloud-aerosol interaction,4/18/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 8.00-2,"Expected Outcome: This activity is expected to enhance our understanding of the cloud- aerosol interactions and their impacts in the Earth system and to include developing advanced algorithms as well as high-resolution models to better reproduce realistic cloud phase and structures, its interactions with different types of aerosols and their radiative impacts.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Enhanced large community effort in Europe to bring together the latest advances in science, modelling, in situ, ground-based, oceanic, and airborne remote sensing as well as satellite observations to tackle the complex cloud-aerosol interactions.
?	Improved Earth systems models and better long-term climate projections, and/or climate prediction, in particular at seasonal and decadal time scales.
?	Better understanding of convective systems leading to improved predictions of extreme events.
?	Reduced uncertainties in climate models through a better representation of cloud formation, aerosol-cloud interaction, and their combined radiative properties.
?	Use and assimilation of aerosol and cloud products from novel satellites (e.g. Earth CARE44, MetOp-SG45) for climate model improvement and validation and/or weather predictions.
?	Contribution to IPCC assessments and other outputs by addressing this major knowledge gap in the Earth system and important source of uncertainty in climate models.
Scope: The challenge of this topic is to improve the representation of cloud life-cycle, aerosol-cloud interactions and chemistry, cloud vertical structures, and the radiative properties of the various aerosol and cloud types that is the largest source of uncertainty in today?s climate models, and represent an important knowledge gap in Earth system and climate science, and in the Earth radiation budget in particular. This requires better understanding of multiple scattering of radiation within the three-dimensional structure of clouds and different direct and indirect effects of aerosols on radiative transfer. It will lead also to a strengthened understanding of mechanisms through which clouds and aerosols modify significantly the planetary albedo and Earth-radiation budget. The science of cloud formation and its impact on climate should be advanced through an integrated use of in situ and satellite observations in high-resolution models which reproduce realistic cloud structures and their radiative properties.
The projects should address this challenge through:


44	EarthCARE - Earth Online (esa.int)
45	Metop - Second Generation | EUMETSAT

?	Making use of new and existing, in situ and satellite measurements, including reanalysis, new parameters such as water isotope composition, and laboratory experiments, in combination with new analysis methods, to advance the scientific understanding of the complex interactions between aerosols, clouds and climate at a fundamental level.
?	Developing novel descriptions of fundamental sub-grid scale aerosol and cloud processes in Earth System models to better represent the radiative and precipitation properties of various aerosol and cloud types in the models.
?	Linking aerosol and cloud processes to hydrologic cycle and advancing understanding of their role for evaporation and precipitation in nature and models.
?	Enhancing the systematic and coordinated collection and use of ground-based or airborne observing systems from relevant existing networks (e.g. Earlinet, Aeronet, ACTRIS). These datasets will also be critical to enhance satellite retrievals and validation of cloud and aerosols parameters.
?	Coordinating with the satellite community where needed e.g. Metop-SG, especially for supporting the validation needs of new missions such as ESA?s EarthCARE.
?	Establishing in the course of the projects wide-open access to the observation data produced within relevant measurement network databases (e.g. ACTRIS).
?	Contributing to assimilation of cloud data in climate models from the ?40 years? record of satellite data available and other means of cloud observations.
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative, both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe, and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme as part of the ESA Atmosphere Science Clusters46 and relevant ESA activities related to the use of the EarthCARE mission.
Proposals should address the collaboration with ongoing or future ESA projects, including those that will be funded through dedicated coordinated invitations to tender, and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination. Applicants are encouraged to contact ESA to organise the joint EC-ESA work.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-05," Science for successful, high-integrity voluntary climate initiatives",4/18/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Recommendations, guidance and capacity building to help governments and non-state actors ensure high integrity in voluntary climate change mitigation initiatives through enhanced evaluation, design, implementation and monitoring.

?	Helping to translate scientific consensus and knowledge (e.g. IPCC reports) and government commitments (e.g. under the Paris Agreement), into meaningful corporate and other non-state climate strategies and actions.
?	Contribution to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal through support to development and scaling up of high-quality voluntary initiatives that deliver genuine climate benefits in Europe and globally.
?	Development of a standardised framework for the assessment of carbon offsetting schemes.
?	Reducing risks of greenwashing, including in the use of offsets, and also of technology- lock-ins.
Scope: To meet the goals of the Paris Agreement global GHG emissions should reach ?net- zero? by mid-century and be halved by 2030 compared to current levels. This requires immediate, rapid and large-scale emissions reductions across all sectors of the economy. Voluntary initiatives and pledges by non-state actors, such as the private sector, financial institutions, civil society, cities and subnational authorities could help fill the gap, mobilise finance and accelerate the transformation process. However, the integrity-related concerns of these actions must first be overcome and require better understanding of the actual climate impacts and other potential side-effects.
This action should advance the knowledge about the role of voluntary initiatives in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal, including consistency and interactions with global/national government commitments, regulated markets and between each other. It should address barriers and weaknesses associated with voluntary initiatives, such as inconsistency of definitions and claims (e.g. net-zero, carbon positive, carbon negative, climate neutral, etc.), their environmental integrity, fragmentation, complexity, poor measurement, verification and reporting practices as well as concerns related to additionality, double counting, transparency, governance, and accounting of the wider social and ecological consequences.
The action should evaluate the role of compensation schemes in voluntary climate initiatives, and the implications for transition pathways. To this end, it should improve the understanding of the impacts of carbon offsets, assess their risks and limitations, investigate how offsets affect and interact with other emission abatement options, and under which conditions they could accelerate cost-effective mitigation. It should analyse the scientific integrity of various existing offsetting schemes, identify their strengths and weaknesses and develop clear scientific guidance about their proper use to safeguard climate-positive outcomes. This should include identification of synergies and avoidance of trade-offs with other policy objectives, such as biodiversity related ones, and full respect of the ?do no significant harm? principle. Any promotion of offsetting schemes is out of scope of this call.

The action should also explore and assess different options for improved monitoring, reporting and verification of various voluntary climate initiatives, including through leveraging of satellite-based earth observation such as Copernicus/ Galileo/EGNOS.
Finally, it should enhance the modelling tools and integrated assessment frameworks to better integrate voluntary carbon initiatives into transition pathway analysis and to address the specific needs of non-state actors (but not necessarily with a single model/tool).
Co-creation with various stakeholders in the private and public sectors, including actors from developing countries, is expected under this action to ensure that the outcomes produced remain relevant for the end-users.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with other relevant ongoing and selected projects for cross-projects cooperation and exchange of results, including as participation in joint meetings and communication events",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-06, Broadening the range of policy options in transition pathway analysis,4/18/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	A broader range of policy options that reflect different visions of sustainability and resilience based on alternative economic, technological and societal futures and reflecting different perspectives from economics, (other) social and natural sciences.
?	Assessment of long-term feasibility of reconciling economic growth with climate and other environmental objectives and consequences for mitigation pathways.
?	More comprehensive understanding of the implications of Paris Agreement-aligned transformation for other (than climate) environmental thresholds and social outcomes, including equity and justice, as a basis for fostering synergies between climate action and other policy goals such as those embedded in the Sustainable Development Agenda.
?	Increased diversity of frameworks and scenarios used in climate change mitigation modelling.
?	Enhanced assessments of 1) energy and material demands and their links to the macro- economy, 2) behavioural and lifestyle changes, including sufficiency measures and their representation in integrated assessment models and 3) circular economy approaches to decrease the use of energy and materials.
?	Development of knowledge to inform future major international scientific assessments such as reports by IPCC and IPBES.
Scope: There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that reconciles continued development of human societies with the maintenance of the Earth system in a resilient and stable state. Meeting the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement while simultaneously respecting other environmental and social constraints would require not only rapid reductions of GHG emissions and other climate forcers, but also decoupling of economic output from material throughput, pollution and biodiversity loss. However, empirical evidence demonstrates a strong relationship between economic growth (expressed in GDP terms) and GHG emissions, energy use, demand for raw materials, land and other natural resources, as well as pollution, with projections indicating that with existing growth trajectories, absolute decoupling on the scale required could prove extremely challenging.
Actions should advance knowledge on the feasibility of the green growth paradigm in the context of transition to climate neutrality, including improved understanding of underlying challenges and opportunities, and by building on the latest scientific evidence. They should explore alternative (to growth-oriented) socio-economic scenarios (such as, but not limited to, degrowth, postgrowth, or ?Doughnut? economic models) which could inform the transition to climate neutrality. Research should look well beyond general concepts and explore the practical implications (where possible quantified), benefits, barriers, conditions for delivering strong social outcomes and feasibility of pursuing such alternative options as a viable policy choice within the EU and beyond. In their work, actions should examine the role of

emerging/potential trends (such as digitalisation, circularity, structural changes in the economy, relocalisation of value chains), geopolitical events and shifts in societal values (e.g. COVID related) in shaping future socio-economic development and assess their impacts on the achievement of climate policy objectives. The analysis should also account for the accelerating impacts of climate change and embrace interlinkages with other policy goals, notably biodiversity, resource conservation and human development related. Building on these results, actions should draw conclusions for Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term strategies under the Paris Agreement.
Actions should address some of the following aspects in their research:

?	Improve the understanding of the dynamics between economic growth and energy, materials? use, pollution and land demand. This could include assessing whether shifts within a GDP-based system, such as a greater share of services and recognition of household labour in national statistics, affect the compatibility of economic growth with climate and biodiversity goals.
?	Advance knowledge about the role and potential of lifestyle changes and sufficiency- oriented measures in the overall strategies towards climate neutrality and in the context of other environmental goals, improve their quantification and representation in modelling frameworks and explore the socio-economic, cultural, institutional, infrastructural, regulatory and other conditions for scaling-up.
?	Identify and explore the main barriers to adoption of alternatives to growth-based economic models. For example: How plausible is it for policy makers to embrace them? Are there real-world examples? Can a region such as Europe pursue alternative approaches unilaterally?
?	Assess the relationship between continued economic growth and societal well-being. Investigate alternative approaches to delivering social progress and evaluate the well- being outcomes of measures to transform societies towards climate-neutrality, taking into account distributional and equity related considerations as well as a broad range of well-being indicators and differences between social groups.
?	Investigate how alternative economic approaches could be explained to and accepted by citizens and businesses concerned about both climate and their livelihoods/operating conditions. For example, which concrete day-to-day changes would be required? What are the implications for living standards? How would professions work? What dis/- incentives would firms face to compete, expand and innovate?
?	Assess the risks of disruption to energy, food and other key commodity markets based on alternative future transition pathways and development paradigms.
?	Explore potential future development paradigms in both high-income and developing economies, taking into account fairness dimension, and evaluate implications for the transition process towards climate neutrality.

The projects are expected to take a truly interdisciplinary approach, leveraging natural, economic and other social sciences to inform policies capable of delivering on multiple environmental, economic and social objectives simultaneously while taking into account constraints related to feasibility and acceptability.
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond model documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles48. In particular, beneficiaries are strongly encouraged to publish data and results in open access databases and/or as annexes to publications.
Successful proposals should establish synergies with the project resulting from the topic ?HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-06: The role of climate change foresight for primary and secondary raw materials supply? as regards implications for resource demand and the associated GHG emissions as well as with the projects resulting from the call HORIZON- CL5-2021-D1-01-02: Modelling the role of the circular economy for climate change mitigation49.

?	Support to the implementation of the EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change and the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change, by enabling better informed adaptation plans and strategies at the regional and local level.
?	Strengthen science-based decision-making when it comes to resilience and disaster risk management, including on the role of nature-based solutions.
?	Stronger local adaptive capacity.
?	Improved synergies between national, regional and local Green Deal objectives, in particular adaptation action.
?	Better coordinated and more impactful R&I activities on adaptation modelling and risk assessment.
Scope: The EU strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change50 stresses the need to increase local resilience, as one of its key implementation actions. The Horizon Europe Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change has been launched in September 2021 with the aim to support at least 150 European regions and communities to become climate resilient by 2030. Yet resources and tools to address adaptation at the local level are often scarce. To improve the support to local adaptation action it is essential to increase the availability, reliability, accessibility and resolution of climate information, in combination with non-climatic natural and anthropogenic drivers, at local and regional scale considering local specificities.
Therefore, actions should:

?	Develop and test user-friendly high-resolution climate physical risk assessments models. This could include improvements in data acquisition, modelling, tools and methods to increase resolution of global climate models and regional climate models in combination with local natural and anthropogenic stressors that underpin risk assessment modelling. Utilize and test relevant resilience models and assessment methods developed in previous R&I programme projects (including FP7 and Horizon 2020).
?	Consolidate information and data on cost and effectiveness of adaptation actions (including from FP7 and Horizon 2020 projects51) at local level, in particular actions that integrate both adaptation and mitigation and in particular nature-based solutions that address both biodiversity and climate crisis. Carry out work to close the remaining

knowledge gaps, particularly in bridging climate models with other earth system (natural and anthropogenic) processes. This should also feed into the knowledge basis of the Mission on Adaptation to climate change and be made available to all EU regions and communities. This work could include improvements in modelling, the design of adaptation pathways and other relevant tools in this domain.
?	Facilitate quick access and operational guidance to knowledge from adaptation ? including:
?	Economic and social implications associated to climate risks.
?	Cross-sectoral impacts of climate change and their associated uncertainties.
?	The cost-effectiveness of adaptation actions, and the co-benefits or regrets associated to the actions.
?	Impact and risk modelling for decision-makers and other stakeholders, in particular to support the development of robust decision-making under uncertainty.
?	Draw-up a roadmap of R&I priorities on adaptation and associated economic modelling, risk assessment, cost-effectiveness valuation and management tools towards a 2030- 2035 timeframe.
To ensure assessments and tools developed by the projects are truly user-friendly, projects should consider participatory approaches to test such assessments and develop comprehensive and non-technical guides to use the results and outputs of the project(s), at regional and local level in representative cases of the climate regions of Europe52.
The use of environmental observations and Earth systems models innovations funded by EU R&I programmes (FP7, Horizon 2020) is encouraged. This should include using data from the Copernicus Climate Change Services, and other relevant sources (such as GEOSS).
The project should closely coordinate with and integrate the results of the existing studies and evidence-based research, namely from projects from topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-CLIMA- 02-03 ?Towards asset level modelling of climate risks and adaptation?53, HORIZON-MISS- 2021-CLIMA-02-01 ?Development of climate change risk assessments in European regions and communities based on a transparent and harmonised Climate Risk Assessment approach?54, and the Study on Adaptation Modelling for Policy Support55.
Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links with the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change Implementation Platform and Climate-ADAPT

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-08, Solar Radiation Modification:  governance of research,4/18/2023,CSA,12/23/2022,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The purpose of the action is to explore conditions that could, hypothetically, govern experimental research in the area of solar radiation modification (SRM), defined as action to reduce solar radiative forcing through means other than through the reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions. The action should identify, on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced assessment, whether and how the governance of SRM field research could work in practice.
The IPCC 6th Assessment report (Working Group I contribution) concluded that SRM could offset some of the effects of anthropogenic warming on global and regional climate, especially if combined with emissions reductions, and with carbon dioxide removal, and phased out gradually. However, a number of risks are associated with its deployment, and the IPCC found that there is low confidence in our understanding of the climate response, especially at regional scales. At international level, its deployment is addressed (and strongly discouraged) by the Convention of Biodiversity due to its potentially substantial negative effects on biodiversity. Nevertheless, the topic continues to draw interest, including from non- state actors, as the effects of climate change itself become more evident.
This call should lead to a better understanding of what the risks and conditions are that would make field research acceptable or unacceptable to stakeholders. Such enhanced understanding is sought without prejudice to its potential use in policy making or regulation.
Scope: In order to achieve the expected outcome, proposals should address all of the
following:

?	Synthesis of the state of the art regarding the potential contribution of SRM to climate stabilisation, and its associated risks.
?	Clarification of what activities constitute SRM, and the extent to which SRM is permitted, prohibited and/or governed within the ERA at present.
?	Proposal of principles and guidelines that could be used by a public authority for permitting, prohibiting or supervising SRM field experiments on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider could include inter alia:
?	Scientific and operational preconditions (e.g. monitoring mechanisms during and after research, time horizon, contingency planning).
?	Legal issues (e.g. liability for impacts).

?	Decision-making processes and ethical considerations (e.g. Who gets to decide? Procedural aspects such as how to ensure broad, informed stakeholder consultation).
?	Approaches to cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment in a context of uncertainty (risk of action, and risk of inaction).
?	An inclusive expert and stakeholder dialogue process, aligned with the principles of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) should be organised in order to inform the analysis mentioned above.
The action is also encouraged to consider the following questions:

?	Whether SRM field research under controlled conditions (e.g. within the ERA or like- minded jurisdictions) could lessen the risk of its unregulated deployment elsewhere in the world.
?	Comparison of the risks of SRM with analogous risk management dilemmas faced by science and society (for example the release of genetically modified organisms).
The action should therefore develop a possible governance framework for SRM experiments on a case-by-case basis, based on a balanced assessment of the best available scientific knowledge, as well as the perspectives of stakeholders. It should also identify what the characteristics of such a governance framework should be, taking into account issues such as scientific rigour, risk assessment and public legitimacy.
Promotion of SRM or conducting of SRM field experiments are outside of the scope of this call.
Actions are encouraged, where relevant, to explore synergies with other initiatives in Europe and beyond investigating Solar Radiation Modification from a technological, regulatory and/or ethical perspective.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-09, Behavioural change and governance for systemic transformations towards climate resilience,4/18/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Support to the implementation of the EU Adaptation Strategy and the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change.
?	Decision-makers at local, regional, national and European level are able to more effectively scale up and accelerate behavioural change for systemic transformations towards climate resilience, knowing more about relevant social tipping points, leverage points and key governance interventions in this context.
?	Citizens and civil society have a better understanding of possible individual actions they may wish to undertake or how to contribute to strategic leverage points that bring about behavioural change supporting climate resilience at larger scale. This should also include knowledge or development of possible governance structures and organisational innovations that would help to galvanise the already existing knowledge and activities in many parts of society.
?	Easier assessment of the potential of and progress in scaling up change in behaviour and creating multiple positive synergies of individual and organisational actions for directing governance to achieving systemic transformations towards climate resilience.
Scope: No matter how successful our efforts to mitigate further climate change will be, some impacts are or will be unavoidable in the future and we will have to adapt to a warmer world. The question is on what terms this adaptation will take place. With the new Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change and the recently launched Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change on this issue, Europe has set out that the direction of this change will be systemic transformations towards climate neutrality and resilience, by 2050.
As nations, regions, cities and local communities are now developing their vision and pathways towards climate neutrality and resilience, increased importance is given to the role of behavioural change, and governance and organisational innovation in achieving the systemic transformations needed to regain resilience in a harsher climate future to events and hazards potentially attributable to climate change.

The objectives of this topic are to reach a better understanding on behavioural change and on how it could be scaled up and connected to the governance of the various drivers of and/or barriers (including EU, national and local policies) to reach the goal of climate neutrality and resilience by 2050.
The role of individual or community behavioural change in this societal transformation is to be approached as embedded in changes of informational, political, economic and technological systems. Shifts from individual values and community behaviour need to be seen as integrated with societal changes in governance, implying a combination of cultural changes and shifting social norms, alongside interventions by institutions and through the market, communications and media57.
Within this scope, projects are requested to enhance the understanding of:

?	Social tipping points and leverage points in climate adaptation: to better understand the social acceptability of non-adaptive behaviours or how new adaptive behaviour would become widespread (social tipping points); to better understand how a small shift in one part of a system would generate changes across the system as a whole (leverage points); to better understand how various systems? leverage points may eventually lead to deliberate transformative tipping points; to understand how increasingly serious threats or consequences of climate change lead to changes of individual and social perceptions and behaviours, and how it leads to changes in local adaptation policies, new social organisation forms and actions. This should also include analysis of incentives and barriers to behavioural change in different spheres of the population (according to gender, social conditions, educational level, etc.).
?	Features of good governance for systemic transformations to climate resilience: to better understand features and structures of governance and institutions to ensure economically, socially and environmentally just transformations appropriate for the local conditions, e.g. mechanisms leading to most cost-effective solutions; a fair distribution of costs and benefits of the transformations; to better understand features and structures of governance and institutions that generate a high systemic adaptive capacity, e.g. the ability to effectively leverage public-private sector investment for adaptation actions; further operationalisation of the notion of equity and justice to support the required transformative systemic adaptations in governance and policy arrangements.
?	Transformative conditions, capacities and learning feedbacks needed for systemic change: to better understand the conditions and capacities that would allow individual behaviour to fundamentally change the system in which they operate so that the system further accelerate new learning feedbacks and changes in individual behaviour, e.g. via experimentation and requiring further access to relevant knowledge and information or opportunities to engage in transformative decision-making.

Projects should focus on all relevant aspects of society, in their interactions with biophysical and climate adaptation components, including, but not limited to, relevant economic sectors, education and up-skilling and re-skilling. Moreover, participatory co-creation approaches at policy making, community, and individual levels, including direct involvement of citizens, new sustainability-oriented business organisations and societal actors where relevant considering social innovation, is highly recommended in order to create robust results. Projects should investigate the dimension of lifestyles and habits and associated factors, motivators and barriers, and be aware of the role of gender and diversity among populations and groups of populations, and how various resources and power relations can influence people?s decisions and willingness to change behaviour.
Projects are expected to contribute to and establish close coordination with the activities of the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change. They are strongly encouraged to use the results of the Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change and the Copernicus Climate Change Service as testbed to underpin their findings.
Finally, projects are requested to develop the following outputs:

?	Concrete recommendations of operational nature to accelerate systemic change in those regions and communities that served as their case studies.
?	General guidance for all other actors at national, regional, or communal level about the most feasible and effective leverage point potentially leading to transformative tipping points, including aspects concerning interrelations, alignment and coordination of the actors/stakeholders.
?	A science for policy operational framework and indicators for assessing the potential of and progress in scaling up change in behaviour and for directing governance to achieving systemic transformations towards climate resilience.

?	A better understanding of which interventions and measures are effective to produce intended but also novel learning outcomes needed for the green transition of our society and economy.
?	Improved methods for measuring impact and implementation of sustainability and climate-related education.
?	Better feedback-loops between improved output-oriented monitoring of sustainability and climate-related education and education policy-related decision-making, including planning and reorienting curricula and programmes, to ensure that policy and programmes remain relevant and effective.
Scope: The dimension of ?sustainability and greening of education and training systems? is still relatively new in the EU context58. Through the Commission?s proposal on learning for environmental sustainability59 as well as European sustainability competence framework60 ? both published in 2022 ? EU Member States/Associated countries have received new impetus to implement education and training related to the environment and sustainability. For effective policy making, including development and revision of curricula and study programmes, it is necessary to assess and monitor the impact that sustainability-related education has. The objective of this project is therefore to better understand and to provide recommendations on how to measure what learners actually learn and how this influences mind-set and actions on sustainability at the individual and collective level.
Projects should therefore:

?	Address both inputs to and outcomes of learning61 and the processes that link them: Methods that address impact assessment of learning outcomes require taking into

61	Learning outcomes relate to what learners know and can do after a ?learning intervention?, usually after an extended period of time (like a study programme). Learning interventions themselves depend on a range of inputs (inducing investments, policies, curricula design). Learning outcomes are usually described as knowledge, skills and attitudes that learners have developed in a specific area.

account commitment (e.g. legislation, policy measures, top-level strategies and action plans), context (governance, structure of education system) implementation (e.g. funding, governance, curricula, teacher training, sustainable infrastructure and resource management) and results (e.g. learning outcomes in terms of skills and competences).
?	Capture the lifelong learning scope and ambition of learning for sustainability: to do so, it will be important to widen the current focus of monitoring pupils and students (mainly at secondary level) to both younger and older generations. Moving beyond formal learning and even beyond education to measuring impact in the wider economy and society requires taking into account contextual factors - both education-related and non- educational - that might influence learning outcomes.
?	Address novel concepts and competences put forward in sustainability and climate change education, such as participatory and challenge-based education, living labs, exploratory and futures thinking. Such approaches encourage learners to imagine and create what does not yet exist, yet they are difficult to capture with pre-defined targets and indicators. Research should therefore go beyond test-based student assessment, which often serves to monitor and measure impact and progress in the area and include aspects such as links with the local community or interdisciplinary, hands-on and socio- emotional approaches, which are crucial for effective learning for sustainability.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with relevant projects and initiatives, such as the two Horizon 2020 projects ECF4CLIM and GreenSCENT, the GreenComp (the European sustainability competence framework developed by the JRC) for cross-projects cooperation, consultations and joint activities on crosscutting issues, to share their results, as well as to participate in joint meetings and communication events. To this end, proposals should foresee a dedicated work package and/or task and earmark the appropriate resources accordingly.
Projects are requested to develop the following outputs:

?	A set of indicators to monitor progress in implementing such education measures.
?	A mapping of policy evaluation methods, monitoring frames and indicators and their relation with approaches and programs in the area of sustainability and climate change education, in EU Member States/Associated countries and internationally, with the objective to identify best practices and reproducible solutions. This should build on work developed during the UN Decade in Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) and the Global Action Programme for Sustainable Development (GAP), which include a ?Global Monitoring and Evaluation Framework? as well as evaluation and assessment of impacts through large-scale testing (including international assessments, such as PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), project-based monitoring/assessment, surveys, etc.
?	Definition of suitable areas for assessment of the impact of education policies/interventions (e.g. measurement of skills/competence of learners, educators; investment in green education; link between education and engagement in sustainability and climate action; effective communication strategies; training of professionals).

?	A comprehensive assessment model on the basis of a wide range of indicators (e.g. capturing commitments, implementation and results).
?	A methodology tailored for conducting impact assessments and evaluations of policies on learning for sustainability (taking into account inputs, processes, context, outcomes), addressed to and adaptable to different education and training approaches and levels in a life-long learning context (i.e. early childhood education and care, school, vocational education and training (VET) and higher education, citizen science, non-formal learning).
?	Running of minimum 2 case studies using the developed methodology.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-11, Needs-based adaptation to climate change in Africa,4/18/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Accelerated deployment of climate services to build climate resilience.
?	Better informed climate adaptation policy response, stronger adaptive capacity and climate resilience in Africa, with a focus on the Sub-Saharan region.
?	Improved synergies between adaptation action and other policy objectives, notably the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.
?	Contribution to the international dimension of the EU Adaptation Strategy and to the Africa-EU Partnership.
?	Knowledge base to underpin major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC Assessment Reports.
Scope: The African continent is on the frontline of the climate emergency; it is highly vulnerable and adaptation to both present and future impacts of climate change is urgent and crucial to secure its long-term resilience and prosperity but it is challenging in the current economic context. While the demand for high-quality, actionable climate information and services is growing, there is a need for more holistic, better connected, more interactive and more user-oriented approaches across the entire adaptation value chain from knowledge production to users. This ranges from improved knowledge base, through increased accessibility, up to enhanced uptake of information and climate services by end-users spanning policy makers, governmental agencies, local authorities, civil society and the private sector. The focus of this topic is on countries in Sub-Saharan Africa ? given the region?s limited response capacities coupled with high vulnerability to climate change impacts that range from droughts, through rising sea levels, cyclones, and floods to rising temperatures and rainfall anomalies with serious implications, notably, for food and water security.
Actions should:

?	Improve the understanding of current and future climate related threats (and opportunities) in Africa in the context of socio-demographic developments, extending into sectors/domains that are underexplored from climate-risk perspective and including dynamics between climate, biodiversity, and political/economic risks such as migration, food security and urbanisation patterns. Actions may address improvements in accuracy and skill of forecasts/projections, in particular as regards the sub-seasonal-to-seasonal time scale.
?	Identify key adaptation challenges, needs and gaps in the broader socio-economic context, including intersection with other policy objectives such as biodiversity protection, increase in agricultural productivity and reduction of inequalities.
?	Enhance planning, implementation and evaluation of climate adaptation strategies and measures (including ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions, as well as

integrated adaptation and mitigation actions) and the understanding of their socio- economic determinants and benefits.
?	Improve and upscale existing and/or develop and test new climate services/tools that bridge the gap between information availability and uptake by end-users in different sectors, including through capacity building and addressing issues such as access, uncertainty, trust, risk perception and management, and other barriers. In either case, actions should demonstrate a clear path towards broader deployment of the services developed.
?	Promote better understanding and enhanced cooperation between various actors such as regional climate centres, national meteorological services, intermediaries, and end-users. Direct participation of relevant entities in the projects is strongly encouraged.
?	Explore and leverage opportunities associated with the digital revolution (including progress in automation, artificial intelligence, and communications) to improve diffusion of climate knowledge and promote more efficient service delivery.
?	Advance knowledge on value assessment of climate services and apply it to the services developed within projects.
Projects may focus on a specific country/region in Sub-Saharan Africa for more customised activities but should evaluate and disseminate information on the broader relevance of their outcomes and options for replication also in other locations.
Actions should pursue active engagement and consultation with relevant stakeholders such as African government agencies, civil society organisations and citizen groups to harness local knowledge and to better account for end-user needs, taking into account the gender dimension. This should include research on co-production of climate information and user engagement models themselves to define which approaches are most suitable for adaptation purposes. Moreover, social innovation should be considered in order to achieve the expected outcomes.
Actions should build on previous work and established structures in the region. Participants should make use of the latest socio-economic, geophysical, and other relevant data, leveraging by rapid progress in digital technologies. This should include observational data from the Copernicus part of the EU Space Programme and other relevant sources (such as in the context of GEOSS Global Earth Observation System of Systems).
Actions should also take into consideration the results of relevant Horizon 2020 projects, such as FOCUS-Africa, Down2Earth, CONFER or HABITABLE, in view of progressing the state of the art and taking the already developed services/tools to the next level.
In line with the Strategy for EU international cooperation in research and innovation (COM(2021) 252), international cooperation is encouraged and projects should aim at comprehensive involvement of African researchers and organisations, in view of maximising the impact and relevance of the projects.

This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research.

Successful proposal(s) should include joint work by European and Chinese experts aimed at informing the achievement of each country?s long-term decarbonisation goal. Actions under this call should consider deep reductions and pathways to net zero incorporating mitigation of both CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.

Actions should focus on all of the following main areas (the individual bullets are indicative suggestions for focus within each area):
a)	Energy efficiency and decarbonisation

?	Adapted models to reflect state-of-the-art greenhouse gas emission data.
?	Opportunities for decarbonisation of industry and agriculture, for reducing net emissions related to land use, and for mitigation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Evaluate the mitigation potential, co-benefits and side effects, and cost-effectiveness of selected technologies in key industries and their potential contribution to a sustainable, secure and affordable transition.
?	Improving energy efficiency, including through electrification in industrial processes, transport and heating systems, as well as for buildings (including through improved design and construction, retrofitting, establishing or improving energy management systems).

?	Socio-economic challenges and opportunities in the transition to climate neutrality, including the transformation of the labour market and the distributional repercussions for different sectors, social groups and regions.
?	Consequences of the green transition for human welfare, including on health.
?	Opportunities and challenges related to consumer behaviour and lifestyle changes (e.g. consumer choices, changes in ways of living and working).
?	Global implications of EU and China decarbonisation (e.g. through trade and commodity markets, impacts on climate action in third countries).
c)	Dissemination and stakeholder engagement

?	Strong component of engagement, in terms of co-design and co-creation of the pathways, with public and private sector stakeholders in both regions, in particular with groups whose actions will be key to implementing and achieving the transition.

Interactions with other actions developed under the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity Research Flagship and/or the Flagship on Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies are encouraged.
The envisaged knowledge relates only to policy, modelling and pathways definition and planning. Development of specific technologies above TRL 4 are out of the scope of this topic.
Actions should:

?	Build on existing modelling work in both regions that has identified credible pathways to net zero emissions, continuing to develop and refine such pathways.
?	Ensure that EU and China pathways fit into a consistent global framework (e.g. in terms of global carbon budget and use of scarce commodities).
?	Focus on key milestones and enabling conditions needed in the short-term (e.g. by 2030, 2035) and medium-term (e.g. by 2040) to achieve each region?s net zero goals. Such milestones and conditions are not limited to emissions levels but can include technological roadmaps for key regions and industries, as well as, regulatory, market penetration and socio-economic developments.
?	Consider different geographical scales and the role of cities in the transition pathways.
?	Feature a combination of integrated assessment modelling (to demonstrate that pathways are coherent and comprehensive) and other more granular techniques to explore specific transformation options in detail.
?	Include stakeholder engagement activities aimed at linking the vision set out in pathways with the actions needed to achieve them (e.g. How mature does a certain technology have to be by when? Is this achievable?).

?	Advanced knowledge on the impacts of climate change and different natural and socio- economic drivers on inland ice and permafrost, and its global repercussions, including climate-ecosystem interactions, which is relevant to international initiatives, such as the

World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)73?s Climate and Cryosphere Project, or the IPBES.
?	Further developed and improved climate and Earth System Models (ESMs) that inform the international climate assessments (e.g. CMIP models, CORDEX) and support the development of ?digital twins? under the Destination Earth Initiative.
?	Advanced provision and use of observations, including in-situ, of complex processes with focus on dynamic and vulnerable regions that may lead to high impact changes.
?	Supported climate change adaptation strategies including, where relevant, the development of solutions to enhance the resilience of local communities.
Scope: Snow cover, ice sheets and glaciers affect not only the Earth radiation balance and the global climate, but also continental climate systems, the weather of circumpolar regions and their terrestrial and oceanic carbon dynamics, ecosystems, and sea level. Snow and ice cover regulate the properties of the ground underneath and are interlinked with permafrost in areas where average ambient air temperature is below 0øC.
The research actions should contribute to observing, modelling, and projecting the characteristics, volume, and dynamic of inland ice and permafrost in relevant regions, impacting regional and global climate, taking inter-seasonal, annual, decadal, as well as long- term (centuries) changes into account.
The actions should enhance the understanding of the ice sheet or glacier dynamics and evaluate reversibility or irreversibility of changes on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Furthermore, actions should quantify other impacts caused by the thawing of the inland ice or permafrost at regional or global levels, like the contribution to sea level rise and stratification or impact on biogeochemistry and ocean currents.
Actions should assess the impact of changing land ice, snow cover, or permafrost on local or regional water cycle and economic supplies and services, evaluate the impact of ice processes on human livelihood and cultures, and identify imminent, medium and long-term potential impacts on ecosystem shifts at local and regional scale.
The actions should provide data, tools, and assessments relevant at regional and local scales to support climate change adaptation and explore, identify and verify ecosystems management techniques to allow better adaptation and maintenance of ecosystem services in a changing land-ice landscape.
International cooperation is strongly encouraged.

Actions should build upon and cooperate with relevant Horizon funded projects (e.g., Arctic PASSION, OceanIce, PolarRES, CRiceS, iCUPE), the EU Polar Cluster, the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service, and the GEO initiative.

Synergies and complementarities should be ensured with the HORIZON-CL6-2024- CLIMATE: Closing the research gaps on Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) in support of global assessments, HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE: Ocean models for seasonal to decadal and local to regional climate predictions, and HORIZON-CL6-2024-ZEROPOLLUTION: Tackling human and climate change induced pollution in the Arctic - building resilient socio- ecological systems.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Better process understanding of past climate changes, their variability and interactions with ecosystems, leading to improved Earth system models based on paleoclimate data.
?	Assessment of driving and feedback mechanisms (e.g., the carbon cycle evolution and water cycle process), and precise timing and dynamics of deglaciation and glaciation.
?	Future climate change scenarios produced in light of documented past changes in climate and ice sheets, in particular warm climates/high sea-level situations, and abrupt transitions.

?	Strengthened Earth system models integrating paleoclimate data, e.g. models of ice sheet, ocean, ecosystem and atmospheric components, enabling understanding of future climate.
?	Identification of thresholds in Earth system components, including the biosphere, and feedbacks that may be responsible for non-linear behaviour of the climate system to certain forcings.
?	Development, review, and improvement of indicators of abrupt changes, or early warning signals, and tipping points within paleoclimate records.
?	Synthesis of climate variations that will serve as fundamental bases for IPCC future assessment and benchmarks for model inter-comparisons.
Scope: The geological and ice-core records provide long-term information on the conditions and processes that can drive physical, ecological, and social systems during interglacial periods, deglaciations and abrupt climatic events. The challenge of the research under this topic is to test Earth system models over selected past climate scenarios, outside the range of variability recorded over the past centuries.
This challenge will be tackled through the following activities:

?	Producing and aggregating in databases high-resolution, well-dated, interoperable paleoclimatic records on climate changes from the past (e.g., temperature, GHG concentrations, sea level, ocean circulation variability, seasonality, and precipitation).
?	Using paleo-archives at high resolution to extend the instrumental time series for better understating of the proxy records and for improved quantification of their uncertainties.
?	Development of Earth system models with outputs that allow a more direct comparison to paleo-data, modelling climate variability, thresholds, and impacts across timescales from years to millennia (e.g., isotope-enabled general circulation models with dynamic ice sheet components that represent relevant feedbacks).
?	Describing short- to long-term climate evolution using quantitative reconstructions from different proxies of past climate periods that are of particular relevance with respect to the current climate change scenario.
?	Identification of climate tipping points, cascading effects, and environmental limits using paleo data and model experiments.
?	Comparing changes in marine, terrestrial and glacier settings to evaluate ocean?land? cryosphere interactions.
?	Documenting and quantifying the natural climate variability, in terms of amplitude, time (onset, duration, frequency) and space (location, extension).

?	Allowing for consistent integration of large-scale and more regional/local factors to be reproduced by climate models using natural forcings.
Synergies with projects resulting from the topic HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-02: Climate- related tipping points should be established.
The projects should rely on paleoclimatic data from scientific drilling campaigns, and other appropriate sources.
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles76.

HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-04, Improved toolbox for evaluating the climate and environmental impacts of trade policies,3/5/2024,RIA,9/12/2023,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:


76	FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

?	Enhance our knowledge and inform policy makers on the positive and negative impacts of trade and trade policy on the climate. Additionally, where relevant, broader effects on the environment, in particular biodiversity, pollution and natural resources depletion may also be considered.
?	Improve and enlarge the toolbox of models and other research techniques as well as available data and its processing to analyse the impact of trade and trade policy on the climate.
Scope: Actions are expected to cover all of the following areas:

?	Study and quantification of the effects of trade on the climate and the environment
?	In-depth study/quantification of the technique and composition effects: in addition to the scale effect of increasing production, trade also has an impact on the sector composition of economies and the technologies used for production. The project(s) should quantify and decompose these effects, including their underlying mechanisms/causes.
?	Growth projections of trade related emissions in developing countries and newly developed countries: it can be expected that most of future trade-related emissions will take place in these countries. The project(s) should therefore estimate and quantify these future emissions under different scenarios, including the extent to which this is related to pollution offshoring and pollution haven effects.
?	Estimate the net effect of trade: clarify/quantify how much of trade related emissions would still take place in the context of the domestic economy without international trade. While trade-related emissions are an important part of total world emissions, not enough is known about the counterfactual, i.e. emissions profiles in the absence of international trade.
?	Study the effects stemming from changes in the use of resources attributable to international trade, both in terms of efficiency gains (e.g. in energy and material use) and in terms of changes in the climate impacts associated with production and consumption, and whether externalities are likely to be internalised. For specific sectors, the action should look into emissions linked to the production in different countries versus transport emissions in trade to those countries.
?	Study trade-related climate and environmental impacts in key sectors like agriculture and livestock, including linkages to regional land use change, use of water resources and differences in agricultural production techniques worldwide. Specific tools and methodologies for agriculture and livestock should also be proposed and refined to be able to give sector-specific advice to policy makers.
?	Study trade-related climate and environmental impacts in key sectors like agriculture and livestock, including linkages to regional land use change and differences in agricultural production techniques worldwide. Specific tools and

methodologies for agriculture and livestock should also be proposed and refined to be able to give sector-specific advice to policy makers.
?	Study the public perception vs. the reality of trade impacting on the environment and climate: while in the public debate trade is often associated with increased emissions related to the scale effect, technique and composition effects point to positive impacts in certain cases. Case studies should also include concrete examples of cases where public perception of trade effects on emissions and real effects diverge.
?	Study and quantification of the effects of trade policy on the climate and the environment
?	In-depth study/quantification of trade creation and trade diversion effects in relation to the climate and the environment: trade liberalisation affects trade flows through the diversion of such flows as well as inducing additional trade. The project(s) should study the net effect of these phenomena on the climate and the environment.
?	Impact of environmental/climate regulation on trade and competitiveness: it can be assumed that in some cases tightened environmental legislation can lead to compliance costs and competitiveness effects. It should be empirically studied to what extent this assumption is correct and to what extent the so-called ?Brussels Effects? impacts these cost and competitiveness effects.
?	What do the expansion of global value chains, offshoring and their fragmentation (and a possible reversal of such trends) mean for the climate and climate-related trade policy: the project(s) should analyse the effectiveness of climate and trade policies in such an international economic context.
?	Effects of openness to trade on environmental and climate policy: trade and international exchanges lead to the diffusion of technology and ideas. To what extent do these effects influence emissions and global climate/environmental policies?
?	The role of trade policy as a tool to address the free rider problems in climate policies: since addressing climate change is a global public good, free-rider problems persist. To what extend can trade incentives and the trade policy toolbox help overcoming these?
?	Analyse the coherence between trade policies, climate policies and other policies such as nutrition-food, resources policies and development policies that affect the impacts on the climate and the environment. Analyse how these policies affect the trade-off between food security and conservation of natural resources (such as forests and water resources).
?	Methodology and toolbox related aspects

?	Impact of trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) on the productivity of sectors (do more productive sectors/producers tend to be cleaner?): the project(s) should endogenise (Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) sector productivity to trade beyond a Melitz-type of framework, including the separation of energy efficiency effects among the productivity effects. Currently since, technological change is mostly exogenous or only roughly calibrated in Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, technique effects on carbon leakage cannot fully be captured.
?	Impact of trade on land use (overall and composition), in particular on deforestation: the project(s) should study methodologies that can be used to better understand the effects of trade and trade policy on land use. Actions should also create/update a trade induced land use/land use change matrix for GTAP sectors.
?	Transport-related pollution: the project(s) should create a transport mode matrix for GTAP sectors per countries and their related emissions.
?	Enlarge/split the GTAP sectors list for emission-intensive sectors: the project(s) should create/improve the GTAP sector matrix for emission-intensive sectors.
Actions are also encouraged to explore and promote synergies between the use of modelling approaches in international trade analysis and in comparable macroeconomic modelling in climate policy, for example, in Integrated Assessment Modelling.
International cooperation with research clusters, which have specific knowledge in areas of this call, is encouraged.
The project should also include dissemination and capacity-building for the findings and tools created among policy makers at the EU and Member States/Associated countries level",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-05," Next generation low-emission, climate-resilient pathways and NDCs for a future aligned with the Paris Agreement",3/5/2024,RIA,9/12/2023,,,Around 4.50-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Methodologies and approaches to promote improved transparency, consistency, and clarity of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction commitments.
?	Production of more diversified, granular, and customised state-of-the-art pathways consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement at global, national and sectoral levels in a diverse selection of countries, better reflecting different national circumstances and constraints and promoting synergies between climate action and other policy objectives.
?	Science-based evaluation of selected existing pathways, policies, and measures to implement NDCs and Long-Term Strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
?	Extended use of modelling, climate change scenarios and mitigation pathways based on provision of tailor-made tools, trainings, and services to end-users.
?	Enhanced international cooperation on identification and implementation of effective mitigation strategies that are aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
?	Improved knowledge base to inform the UNFCCC processes, including the design and revision of post-2030 NDCs and the Global Stocktake in 2028, as well as major international scientific assessments such as the IPCC and IPBES reports.
Scope: As showcased by various independent assessments, the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and climate policies fall short of reaching the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. Strengthening is necessary to close the ambition and implementation gaps, and to align national climate action with global objectives, while simultaneously achieving the broader Sustainable Development Goals and social welfare.
Moreover, while countries have put forward plans, strategies, and announcements to reach ?net-zero? targets, these commitments are hard to compare due to varying definitions, ranging from ?zero-carbon? to ?net-zero CO2? and ?net-zero greenhouse gases? whereas choosing

different gases, different (time)scales and different aggregation methods can lead to very different climate outcomes. To address these concerns, actions should define principles for high-integrity, more coherent climate commitments and review processes.
Projects should contribute to strengthening of national climate policies, NDCs and long-term strategies, by developing next generation low-emission transformation pathways, with increased sectoral detail, and fostering more holistic and more integrative approaches that promote synergies and minimise trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity and other policy objectives. They should support the creation of tools that evaluate the existing NDCs and facilitate monitoring processes.
Projects should address some of the following aspects in their research:

?	Development of sectoral climate transition scenarios (energy production, transport, industry, buildings, food/agriculture etc.).
?	Increase the understanding of the role of ecosystems, in particular land use, in NDCs and other climate commitments identifying options for enhancing transparency and coherence with global models and pathways.
?	Enhance knowledge about the role of non-CO2 gases in meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement and the implications for the transition pathways of countries and sectors.
?	Improve the integration of climate impacts and risks in mitigation pathway analysis, including cost-benefit analysis.
?	Advance knowledge on adequacy and fairness of climate commitments and strategies, taking into consideration feasibility of actual deployment. This should include, but not be limited to, the analysis of the role and effectiveness of international financial flows in delivering on climate goals together with identification of most impactful approaches.
?	Improve understanding of how corporate and non-state commitments could affect national/regional mitigation pathways, for example through their effect on global supply chains.
Co-creation with various stakeholders in the private and public sectors is expected under this topic to ensure that the outcomes produced remain relevant for their end-users. Actions should contribute to improving accessibility of climate change scenarios and models by non- specialist audiences, for example through development and delivery of dedicated services and tools that facilitate user-friendly access and proper use.
Actions may cover a set of regions or be focussed on a specific one and explore it in greater detail. However, in all cases consortia should benchmark their results with global mitigation pathways.

International cooperation is encouraged, in particular with countries of the African Union77 and least developed countries78 requiring support for the design and implementation of their NDCs and long-term strategies, as well as with countries making part of the global top ten emitters79.
Synergies with projects resulting from the topic D1-9. 2023 - Science for successful, high- integrity voluntary climate initiatives should be established as regards the role of non-state voluntary climate initiatives in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and with projects resulting from the Horizon 2020 topic LC-CLA-02-2019 -Negative emissions and land-use based mitigation assessment80 as regards latest methodological developments.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
When dealing with models, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness, as much as possible going well beyond model documentation and extending to aspects such as assumptions, code and data that is managed in compliance with the FAIR principles81. In particular, beneficiaries are required to publish data and results in open access databases and/or as annexes to publications. Projects should also take into account, during their lifetime, relevant activities and initiatives for ensuring and improving the quality of scientific software and code, such as those resulting from projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-02 on the development of community-based approaches",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-06, The role of climate change foresight for primary and secondary raw materials supply,3/5/2024,RIA,9/12/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal will support the transition to a digital and low carbon society in the context of the European Green Deal with a particular emphasis on climate change and raw material value chains. In particular, it should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Short-, medium-, and long-term scenarios of changes in the type, origin and quantity of raw materials (metals/minerals) required for the twin transition.
?	Geo-referenced projections for the changes to the greenhouse gas and energy footprint associated with the supply of these primary and secondary raw materials with a view to facilitating their use in integrated assessment models.
?	Models and data contributing to the development of the European Commission?s Raw Materials Information System82.
?	Inputs to international scientific assessments such as reports by IPCC, the International Resource Panel and IPBES.
Scope: Achieving enhanced digitalisation and a low carbon society will involve a change in the type and quantity of the raw materials required by the economy. This can result in geopolitical shifts in extraction and processing, as well as an increase in the extraction, processing, and recycling of many minerals and metals, including ones that have so far been only marginally important. Materials are likely to be extracted from increasingly lower grade ores and hostile environments, from mining wastes, as well as through recycling. Ceteris paribus, this would involve a general increase in the energy required to supply raw materials, as well as associated greenhouse gas emissions and changes in some other environmental impacts (such as related to transport and land take for mineral extraction and waste disposal). It will also involve changes in technologies and substitution to materials with lesser environmental impact, some of which not sufficiently well understood. This can include consideration of substitution and circular use of materials.
This action will improve knowledge concerning the options, and challenges, in the short, medium, and long-term associated with the provision of raw materials required for the twin transition with a focus on interlinkages with climate change.
Sectors, technologies and material value chains to be analysed will be selected on a justified basis. The project will analyse changes to the carbon footprint associated with supply options for a justified selection of primary and secondary raw materials for short, medium and long- term time horizons. Options analysed will relate to raw materials likely to have large changes



82	https://rmis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/

in supply due to the twin transition, where important geopolitical and technological changes are likely in relation to the twin transition and circularity.
The analyses should build on established life cycle assessment and product environmental footprint requirements, as relevant, and contribute to their further development. Modelling should be detailed to account for geo-political/site-specific changes in supply, technologies, and e.g. energy consumption. Scenarios will build on, as far as available, existing demand scenarios from European Commission modelling activities, and are expected to take into account the relevant EU policies (Fit-for-55 package, carbon neutrality by 2050). Scenarios are expected to account for the foreseen variation and innovation advances in extraction, processing, recovery, recycling and other technologies along the value chains, including changes to the energy mixes involved at specific locations.
The proposal will include the involvement of experts for the different technologies related to the primary and secondary raw material options selected as well as representatives of the integrated assessment modelling community.
This action will develop state-of-the-art knowledge (models and databases) in relation to climate change and the implications of different options associated with the twin transition and the related increases in supply of some raw materials.
The action will build on existing modelling work for the supply and demand of primary and secondary raw materials and expand them to reflect typical transition pathways, to highlight the implications on climate change.
The action will align to established requirements of existing methodological and data frameworks such as for life cycle assessment and product environmental footprint.
While focusing on selected technologies and site-dependent modelling, conclusions should provide insights related to opportunities and challenges for sectors associated with the twin transition.
Stakeholders are to be selected on a justified basis to be consulted at key steps to provide informed feedback on the modelling, data and analyses.",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D1-01-07, Quantification of the role of key terrestrial ecosystems on the carbon cycle and related climate effects,3/5/2024,RIA,9/12/2023,,,Around 10.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A comprehensive assessment and quantification of the role of terrestrial biogeochemical dynamics and the role of vegetation in the carbon cycle, compared to pre- industrialisation situation, building on dedicated in situ data collection, novel satellite data development, and advanced carbon cycle modelling.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Enhanced understanding and characterisation of the terrestrial carbon pools and fluxes, including through taking account of hydrological exchanges, with unprecedented accuracies and spatial scales, building on the advent of a new generation of satellite missions (e.g., ESA?s BIOMASS, FLEX, Sentinel missions, NASA?s NISAR, GEDI, ICESat-2 etc?), that radically change the way the terrestrial carbon cycle can be observed.
?	Improved methods for the monitoring of key ecosystems state in Europe, regarding terrestrial carbon, including e.g. forestry, croplands, peatlands, inland water, extensive grasslands, tundra, tidal marshes, seagrass, and mangroves, and tackling key gaps in observations e.g. age-structure, species richness, canopy structure (including use of Terrestrial Laser Scanning), observations of wood density, interaction with hydrology and exchange with atmosphere in particular observations of biological volatile organic compounds, CO2, CH4, N2O, and black carbon/particulates emissions.
?	Improved handling of anthropogenic management practices (land use including forestry) in terrestrial carbon modelling, including lateral transfers of carbon (notably in the form of harvested biomass including exports, imports, and use as well of land-water exchange).
?	Improved understanding of impacts on carbon cycle of extreme events (wind throw, drought, pest outbreaks, fire), the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance including degradation and behaviour and recovery of forest post-disturbance.

?	Improved consistency between top-down methods such as atmospheric inversions and bottom-up approaches based on land-surface models, in-situ and satellite observation, flux measurements, and national and global statistics.
?	Assessment of the consistency of observation and advanced models through benchmarking activities at multiple scales including point measurements, and satellite observations at multiple temporal and spatial resolutions.
?	Novel monitoring frameworks combining remote and proximate sensing techniques with machine learning and edge computing.
Scope: The main challenge of this topic is to develop an enhanced capacity to better characterise and reduce uncertainties of the carbon cycle related to key terrestrial European ecosystems as a function of anthropogenic emissions, environmental forcing conditions, and management practices. In order for this challenge to be met, actions should be performed at spatial resolutions required to represent the mechanisms by which human interventions necessary to move towards net-zero carbon balance, can be quantified. Further, the dynamics and response of vegetation to climate change, short- and long-term stress, natural dynamics (e.g. fire), and especially change in frequency, form and severity of extreme events, need to be better understood and quantified.
Proposals should address the above challenges through:

?	Coordinated European effort to expand dedicated campaigns to collect in situ-data, including from citizen observations, on land cover, land use and related changes, and on the main processes caused by these, to support the modelling of these changes based on current and historical trends, and to develop empirically based scenarios connecting land use and land cover change to carbon emissions, and sequestration potential.
?	Advances in land surface and carbon modelling supported by high-performance computing capacity, allowing models to be run at unprecedented resolutions, and accuracy, through improved data assimilation workflow from remotely sensed data and vegetation models. The emphasis should be on area wide effect of the ecosystem?s microbiome, and consistency across spatial and temporal resolution and with satellite observation processes.
?	Extending and complementing satellite observations with elements linked to the LUCAS survey of Eurostat, to the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) initiatives on integrated soil monitoring systems, and to research infrastructure e.g. eLTER and ICOS, as well as through comparison with past data and through coordination with Earth observation efforts (spectral signature characterisation, biophysical and biogeochemical observations commensurate with satellite resolutions, aircraft / unmanned aerial vehicle campaigns).
?	Specific efforts to develop carbon and land surface models consistent with specific variables or outputs that can be directly interfaced or compared with satellite observations e.g. above ground biomass, soil moisture, solar induced fluorescence,

disturbance dynamics e.g. fire, and inclusion of additional key processes (coupling with Nitrogen and Phosphorus cycles and water, CO2 fertilisation, assimilation of photosynthesis rates from global observation for direct gross primary production estimation).
A significant coordination effort and collaboration with the relevant activities of major international scientific groups (e.g., IPCC, Global Carbon Project) and ESA Carbon Science Cluster.
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative, both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe, and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme as part of the ESA Atmosphere Science Clusters83 and relevant ESA activities related to the use of the EarthCARE mission.
Proposals should address the collaboration with ongoing or future ESA projects, including those that will be funded through dedicated coordinated invitations to tender, and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination. Applicants are encouraged to contact ESA to organise the joint EC-ESA work.
Applicants should ensure coordination with complementary projects funded under the ESA Carbon Science Clusters of the FutureEO programme including relevant ESA activities related to the use of the novel BIOMASS and FLEX missions.",

?	A European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependency on third countries for critical raw materials by promoting resource efficiency.
?	Increased European competitiveness by offering sustainable, safe, energy efficient and low carbon, water and biodiversity footprint battery materials production technologies and scalable solutions and by creating new business opportunities and circular models for European industry.

?	Proven technical feasibility of downstream processing for battery-grade materials at larger scale, considering economic feasibility, safety, health and regulatory targets.
?

?	Use of European post-mining (or post-extraction, in the case of e.g. geothermal fluids) primary materials and secondary material sources such as tailings (e.g., as a source of nickel, cobalt and lithium) or underutilised battery raw materials deposits and extend the local refining capacity of battery-grade materials, to reduce the dependency on imported materials and to limit supply risks.

Scope: Proposals are expected to cover research and innovation activities with focus on improved battery metal and material production, refining and recovery while minimizing environmental impact of downstream processing by addressing all of the following points:
?	Developing sustainable and cost-efficient processing methods for battery-grade materials and components, coming from either primary or secondary streams and novel technologies for battery metals processing enabling the reduction of carbon footprint and other emissions while increasing energy and resource efficiency; enabling thereby vertical integration into the battery production.
?	Developing and demonstrating technologies to improve battery grade metals and materials production, refining and/or recycling with efficient and stable reagent circulation, targeting low use chemical and reducing environmental impacts from such processes while improving recovery rate/grade and yield considering the SRIA objectives and KPIs, the Green Deal objectives and the EU proposed battery regulation where relevant.
?	Addressing zero waste and zero discharge strategies for the valorisation of the generated waste materials during the refining processes by: improving the reuse of waste where CRM are present; Increasing the sustainability of batteries materials by reducing the use of chemicals and energy use in the downstream processing considering the objectives of the proposed battery regulation as evaluated by LCA or similar approaches; using safe and low impact disposal methodologies for those materials that cannot be recycled.
?	Pre-assessing recycling concepts by their life cycle sustainability and safety impacts (in line with Safe and Sustainable by Design Framework98 to be set by the Commission for assessing safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials and which should be considered as a reference in the proposal) and studying overall techno-economical solutions for recovery systems in order to minimize cost, environmental impact and system losses.
?	Addressing understanding of physico-chemical mechanisms for more sustainable hydrometallurgical steps in order to propose significant processes? improvements to reduce significantly water effluents quantities and chemical reagents.
?	Implementing of continuous process for cathode active materials and precursors synthesis related conditions at larger scale.
Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

?	A European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials by promoting a circular economy.


99	https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/research-area/industrial-research-and-innovation/key- enabling-technologies/advanced-materials-and-chemicals_en

?	The development of recycling technologies targeting upcoming recycling feeds and producing high quality precursors, semi-products and battery materials enabling their use in the battery production and other production processes.
?	Achievement of the recycling targets as described in the proposed battery regulation by industries, especially for low metal and low material value components.
?	Recycling chains with a cost-effective process in comparison with primary materials.
?	Safeguarding of the sustainability, low CO2 footprint, low chemicals usage and minimal emissions of newly developed recycling processes.
Scope: Proposals should focus on improved and verified circularity of collected, dismantled and pre-treated battery waste feeds (Strong interaction with call ?Advanced sustainable and safe pre-processing technologies for End-of-Life batteries recycling (2024)? is encouraged). All recycling concepts should address waste stream(s) in question in a comprehensive manner, aiming at the maximal recovery of input elements and components, rather than selected fractions. Focus on all concepts should be kept on recycling process development; a maximised material recovery efficiency, operational energy efficiency, mass- and energy balance, purity of the products and verified holistically decreased carbon footprint supported by life cycle assessment. Battery development is out of the scope, interaction with other projects is, however, encouraged.
The following issues should be addressed:

?	New recycling concepts targeting the recycling of economically low value materials, (e.g. from Lithium-iron phosphate or sodium-ion ?) are expected to be covered. To enable recycling of low value battery compositions, new recycling concepts should be developed, including direct recycling routes that may include selective material recovery technologies and the reconditioning of the active materials. The additional recovery and recycling of non-cathode component materials are encouraged.
?	Highly efficient recycling of battery manufacturing scrap, whether emanating from lab- scale or large production, are expected to be covered, for example including direct recycling concepts to re-introduce the materials in the battery production chain, including the handling and processing of relevant semi-material.
In addition, at least one of the following issues are expected to be addressed:

?	Highly robust or flexible processes for the recycling of material streams of varying composition and quality may be covered.
?	Material feeds from other industries (e.g. Ni/Co rich materials) may be introduced into the recycling concepts.
?	Material feeds from future battery technologies with an expected market introduction no later than 2025 may be included.

?	The processing of side streams (e.g. waste waters) may be targeted.
All proposed recycling concepts are expected to be pre-assessed for their economical, ecological and safety impact.

?	The understanding of digital twins as systems with automated data acquisition, connected digital models and value-adding applications.
?	The capacity to go beyond single process consideration with potential perspective on the process chain.
?	The implementation and the transfer of digital twins into existing and future battery cell production plants.
?	Safety and security, scalability, explainability, computational speed as well as contributions to sustainability of battery cell production.
?	Optimise product quality, improving the resource efficiency and, consequently, the production time and cost of battery cells in the manufacturing process at the targeted scale.
Scope: The battery production chain consists of diverse multi-disciplinary, rather novel processes with numerous influencing factors and interdependencies. Digital twins, as a core element of the accelerating digitisation in manufacturing, bear the potential to improve planning and operation of current and future battery production system. With their connection of advanced digital models and most up-to-date data, decision support or even autonomous control of battery production processes and process chains is enabled. First applications can be found in research and partly also in industrial practice ? however, those still tend to be rather specific, covering just selected aspects of digital twins (e.g. just specific models) and are often hardly transferable between production stages and between different battery configurations in terms of the underlying IT architectures and models. Proposals are expected to address all following points:
1.	Developing digital twins of battery cell manufacturing routes at pilot line level that incorporate appropriate models but also their connection to real manufacturing plants,
e.g. to support process development and operation, battery cells optimisation, accelerate the set-up of effective manufacturing processes for the next generation battery cells or to demonstrate the capability for predictive maintenance.

2.	Design robust digital tools integrating multi-physics, data-driven models and hybrid modelling.
3.	Flexible Digital Twins capable to evolve to different battery chemistries, new disruptive materials as well as new manufacturing processes (the model would be chemistry neutral so easily adaptable to new disruptive materials and chemistries).
4.	Verify the transferability from pilot to production plant level.

5.	Propose applications that will enable to overcome single process considerations towards process chain perspectives.
6.	Implementation of the sensorisation of the manufacturing plant and automatisation of the data acquisition.
7.	Ensuring greater interoperability, by implementing available data standards 101, e. g., Modelling-Data (MODA) and Characterisation Data (CHADA), as well as, a common semantic framework, like The European Materials Modelling Ontology (EMMO) and the battery interface ontology (BattINFO).
8.	Promote the control and decision making of the manufacturing chain.

9.	Aspects like safety and security, explainability of models as well as contributions to sustainability of battery production will be addressed.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D2-01-06, Open Pilot Line/Test Bed for hydrogen,4/18/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 10.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Contribute to the goals of the European Hydrogen strategy to support the European Green Deal and progress towards climate neutrality by 2030.
?	Provide services for testing innovative hydrogen production technology leading to technology upscaling, reducing cost, accelerating time to the market, and reducing investment risk.
?	Contribute to the creation of an industrial ecosystem of green hydrogen production technology providers.
Scope: The Staff Working Document on hydrogen highlighting the EU R&I support for implementing the Green Deal hydrogen strategy and contributing to a roadmap of actions called for better synergies at European and national level as well as between European and Member States programmes and activities. A single-entry approach for testing hydrogen production technology was identified as the Open Innovation Test Bed (OITB).
Open Innovation Test Beds were first conceived in the Horizon 2020 work programme. They are entities, established in at least three Member States or Associated Countries, offering access to physical facilities, capabilities and services required for the development, testing and upscaling of technology in industrial environments. OITBs will upgrade existing or support the setting of new public and private test beds, pilot lines, and demonstrators to develop, test and upscale technologies and services for new innovative products for specific technology domains.
The applicants are required to implement the set-up of an Open Innovation Test Bed (OITB) for hydrogen production technologies. The proposal should address the following:
?	Provide services for testing of emerging hydrogen production technologies mentioned in the Agenda Process SRIA105. It will cover all activities from the prototyping to industrial production, and especially the testing in an industrial environment, the validation of the

characteristics H2 production technologies and the control of the respect of legal and regulatory constraints.
?	Provide a technology assessment base line for future developments of the technology being tested.
?	Provide an assessment of the circularity of the technology being tested as well as potential domains for increasing its sustainability /Ensure that the innovations tested contribute to sustainability considering circularity in the design phase, less (or no) use of (critical) raw materials and decreasing negative environmental and social impacts.
?	The OITB needs to be operational within the first six month of the start of the project.
Access to the OITB opened to all potential customers. Open access in this context means that any interested party, from Europe and globally, can access test beds' facilities and services independently whether they are part of the consortium or not. It is critical that any interested party from the EU or Associated Countries can access the test beds at fair conditions and pricing and with transparent and mutual obligations with regards to, for instance, security, safety and intellectual property rights.
It is expected that SMEs will have access the test beds at the same conditions as any other entity from the EU or Associated Countries. For SMEs as core targeted user group, the test beds will offer a range of services which are of specific interest to them, e.g. regulatory support and the development of innovative materials that SMEs frequently cannot afford on their own. Proposals should demonstrate a solid and measurable outreach strategy towards SMEs and innovators outside the consortium.
As OITB aims at providing a full service along all the steps of the technological development of a physical innovation, all needed expertise has to be provided to users through a Single- Entry Point (SEP). The SEP is a separate legal entity of which the legal structure is up to the partners involved; however, the consortium needs to come up with a convincing structure that shows its capacity to work together as well as ensure sustainability during the implementation of the grant. If necessary, each test bed will acquire complementary services from other entities, for instance on characterisation and or modelling, in order to offer a full-service package to users.
The proposal needs to present a credible business plan aiming at future sustainability and operation of the OITB, included after the grant ends. It should set a framework for the definition of the access conditions to their facilities and services respecting transparency and fair access conditions.
Projects should collaborate with the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking on aspects that require integration of hydrogen and are expected to contribute and participate to the activities of the TRUST database and the hydrogen observatory.

Scope: The aim of this topic is to promote and facilitate technologically, financially, and operationally mature projects from Horizon 2020 to reach deployment phase by means of developing synergies with other EU funding programmes, namely the ETS Innovation Fund.
The topic aims to support four separate coordination and support actions (CSA), each respectively focussing on one of the following areas:
1.	Low-carbon technologies in energy-intensive industries,

2.	Carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS)107.
3.	Renewable energy generation.

4.	Energy storage & hydrogen.

For each individual CSA, consortia should include partners from at least 3 different Horizon 2020 projects having developed mature technological innovations108 with high potential of deployment under IF109,110. However, depending on the specific sector the consortium focuses on, and on the number of Horizon 2020 projects that have already reached an adequate stage of maturity, a higher number of Horizon 2020 projects represented per individual consortium is preferred.
Each CSA should produce as the final output a number111 of sound proposals112 (including detailed plans for scalability, commercialisation, and financial models) to be presented to the IF.
Consortia should mobilise (either through internal competences in the consortia or through outsourcing) the needed expertise for the preparation of sound proposals, keeping in mind the ETS IF evaluation criteria: 1) Project maturity, 2) GHG emissions avoidance potential, 3) Degree of innovation, 4) Degree of technical, financial, and operational synergies within the consortium.
Each proposal should also contribute to the development and operationalisation of a continuous innovation pipeline from Horizon 2020 innovations to deployment. For this, proposals should:
?	Work in collaboration with key R&I organisations and industrial associations in their respective areas including Horizon Europe public-private partnerships such Processes4Planet, Clean Steel, Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, and Clean Energy Transition/Batt4EU.



107	Proposals may include CCU, CCS or CCUS approaches.
108	In particular projects aiming at a high TRL level, e.g Horizon 2020 Innovation actions

110	https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/funding-climate-action/innovation-fund/small-scale-projects_en
111	The final number will be decided by the consortia depending on the specific sector and the number of mature projects funded by Horizon 2020.
112	Individual proposals for the IF will not be considered public deliverables to ensure full confidentiality.

?	Devote sufficient resources to collaborate among the proposals selected in the different areas in particular to organise joint activities to promote the mobilisation of the financial and technical expertise needed for the elaboration of sound IF proposals.
?	Organise joint open events within their specific area with key industrial stakeholders to share lessons learnt and to promote synergies between Horizon Europe and the IF (e.g. organising open key information dissemination workshops with a larger group of Horizon 2020 projects).
?	Cooperate with IF to seek advice and give feedback on lessons learnt to EU innovation funding opportunities, and to prepare a written report detailing the process and achievements within the respective specific area.
Whilst the topic primarily focuses on supporting the project pipeline from Horizon 2020 to the Innovation Fund, the scope of this topic is not limited to the Innovation Fund, and the promotion of projects to deployment including other relevant funding means either at EU or national/regional levels (such as Regional & Cohesion funds, Recovery and Resilience Facility, Important Projects of Common European Interest) is also desirable",

The partnership is expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Enhanced multi-level cooperation and alignment on R&I on sustainable urban development across and within cities, regions and countries, including international outreach and cooperation with other networks and initiatives.
?	Strengthen Europe as a role model for R&I on sustainable urban development.
?	Innovative, cross-sectoral and inclusive urban governance, policy and decision-making harnessing the full potential of social science and citizens? engagement in the city making process.

?	Science and evidence-based implementation of the European Green Deal, the Urban Agenda for the EU and other European, national, regional and local urban-relevant policies and strategies.
Scope: The proposal should describe strategy, plans, activities and initiatives that would enable the co-funded Driving Urban Transitions to a sustainable future (DUT) partnership to ensure, as appropriate, a seamless pursuance of the strategy, objectives, initiatives and actions envisaged under the current Grant Agreement. In doing so, it is expected to take full account of the progress so far achieved and the evolution in relevant EU and international policy frameworks and urban initiatives. It should capitalise on new opportunities offered by the recent Association Agreements to Horizon Europe to enhance its expertise, capacities and critical mass and broaden its geographical coverage to assist cities at European and global level in meeting their sustainability and climate neutrality challenges. To ensure coherence

and complementarity of activities and leverage of knowledge and investment possibilities, DUT is expected to foster close collaboration and synergies with the mission platform113 for the ?Climate Neutral and Smart Cities? Mission, and to coordinate closely with the mission supporting TRAMI114 and CapaCITIES networks115, the CRAFT platform116 and the Global Knowledge Exchange Centre on pathways for urban climate neutrality117.
Furthermore, close collaboration and synergies are expected to be pursued with other relevant Horizon Europe European Partnerships such as Clean Energy Transitions (CET), Built environment and construction (Built4People), Rescuing biodiversity (Biodiversa+), Safe and Sustainable Food Systems, Towards Zero Emission Road Transport (2ZERO), Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM), EIT Urban Mobility and Water4All.
To this end, proposals should plan resources under a dedicated work package to describe actions to implement such collaborations.
Interfaces to public procurement and investment programmes and links with the Urban Agenda for the EU, the European Urban Initiative (EUI) including its strand on Innovative Actions under cohesion policy, private funds, etc. should be explored and concrete actions to foster synergies should be developed.
Mutually benefitting international outreach, collaboration and cooperation with global and international cities and research funding networks through, for instance the global urban transitions Mission Innovation initiative should be pursued to align strategies and research agenda and promote scientific evidence and good practice for urban policy on international level.
The evaluation of this proposal will be done internally by Commission services.

The outcome of this action will result in an amendment of grant agreement 101069506 [the existing grant agreement] to increase its budget. This type of amendment is exceptional and will apply exclusively to co-funded European Partnerships.

The batteries also contain toxic chemicals, which should be preventatively separated to promote environmental protection and sustainability. Moreover, the pre-treatment processes also help to reduce the scrap volume and allow the separation of the battery components.
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

1.	A European economic base which is stronger, more resilient, competitive and fit for the green and digital transitions, by reducing strategic dependencies for critical raw materials by promoting a circular economy.
2.	The direction of the EU battery industry towards the zero-waste concept by developing holistic, materials and energy efficient recycling processes that can increase the content of recovered mass and by improving the cooperation between recyclers and battery manufacturing through a vertical integration strategy, for those cases where battery and/or component repurposing is not a viable option.

3.	The circularity of battery materials, where also non-metallic elements (electrolyte, solvent, salts and polymers) are recycled back to use (as raw materials or valuable chemicals). The ?cradle to cradle approach? will be addressed though waste pre- treatment by safe and sustainable separation and recovery.
4.	Environmentally beneficial processes for battery pre-treatment (pre-processing and separation) of the main elements to decrease the CO2 footprint and other emissions of the recycled materials.
5.	Safe technologies aimed at improved recovery yield, increased quality and purity level of the recycled/recovered materials, improved impurity removal.
Scope: The current EOL LIB recycling technologies are focused on improving the recovering efficiency of Cobalt that is the most valuable material. However, other no-Co battery contents need to be extracted in one go to develop recycling processes with economic, societal and environmental perspectives. They, for instance, include low-density plastics, metal shells and foils, binders, separators, organic solvents, Li salt, anode active materials. Successful separation methods have the potential to enrich the constituent of targeted materials and improve the profit for recycling.
In recent years, several pre-treatment processes were tested at least at lab-scale (usually mechanical, thermal and chemical options). The goal is to develop and integrate new advanced pre-processing concepts that enable more efficient and safe technologies for recycling EoL LIBs. Substantial improvements should be achieved in the processes environmental and economic viability and in the circular economy, narrowing the sustainability gaps in the whole battery recyclates pre-treatment.
The following pre-treatment concepts are expected to be addressed:

1.	Battery sorting at component level that should be more efficient, accurate, also including recommendations for the standardisation of labelling of battery components, due to the huge variation of physical configurations, cell types and chemistries, with the aim of re- using the suitable components.
2.	Advanced pre-processing methods including (but not limited to) physical, mechanical, dry, thermal and aqueous pre-treatment methods that allow improved pre-concentration while minimising as much as possible waste side products.
3.	Process design enabling the recovery and valorisation of anode materials.

4.	Electrolyte valorisation through the development of sustainable and safe processes for the recovery of Li-salts.
5.	Separation of all the strategic battery materials that should be integrated into existing/innovative recycling processes to mitigate potential effect of impurities.

6.	Recovery of electrode current collectors (Al and Cu) that should be improved by developing more efficient separation methods of the metal foils from the electrode materials and easier removal of the organic binder.
7.	Other recoverable not-active materials from the EoL battery (solvent as EC, DEC, DMC, binders, separator).
8.	Pre-assessing concepts by their life cycle sustainability and safety impacts and studying overall techno-economical solutions for recovery systems in order to minimize cost, environmental impact and system losses.
Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan).

Scope: Non-lithium-based batteries have the potential to provide solutions for integration of renewables by providing energy storage solutions, either stand-alone, or as part of larger grid. Proposals are invited for projects which advance the development of non-Li battery systems, show their potential to be manufactured at scale at a cost the market will bear, and which meet regulatory requirements (including regulations for the recycling/re-use of batteries).
Projects may target any stationary storage applications, from a few kWh in small-scale domestic behind-the-meter units, to many MWh in large utility-scale front-of-meter installations.
Whilst stationary storage packaging constraints may not be as stringent as mobile applications in terms of volume and mass, total cost (?/kWh/cycle) and safety are critical to proving technological and commercial viability. Safety concerns become especially prominent as installation sizes increase due to the huge amount of stored chemical energy.

Projects are encouraged to:

?	Develop new materials that improve techno-economic performances and/or the ability to meet sustainability targets.

?	Show how cell and system design and material improvements optimise techno-economic performance by defining (i) technical and commercial targets, and (ii) quantified success criteria/KPIs by which progress toward achieving the targets may be evaluated during both development and validation phases of the project.
?	Demonstrate a credible commercial and technical path, from end-of-project outcomes to a stationary-energy-storage product, and which takes account of future manufacturing and recycling requirements.
?	Provide evidence of current and future sustainability, viable European supply chains and rigorous analyses of the complex sustainability and recyclability issues including compatibility with regulation, including recycling regulations.

BMS development is within scope where relevant but should not be the main focus of the project. In any case, developments of the BMS need to take into account the renewable energy directive and any pending amendments, notably for the requirements for real-time access to the data of the BMS.
Projects which, in addition, demonstrate the suitability of the solution under development for other emerging energy storage markets, such as motive power for off-road and transport applications with similar system requirements are encouraged.
Projects focussed on materials discovery for novel chemistries are out of scope. However, material refinements of known chemistries undertaken to achieve performance, sustainability, safety and cost targets are in scope.
Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination.

A competitive European battery value chain will have to deliver highly performant and safe battery systems in order to enable the necessary uptake of electrified mobility applications.
This topic focuses on delivering a safe by design approach129 for batteries reduced in size and weight which will deliver the performance necessary for mobile applications. The objective is to ruggedise energy storage packs by enlarging the environmental and operational conditions in which they can operate, while maintaining a high level of performance and achieving a reduction in the size and weight of the battery pack.
Successful projects are expected to deliver on both following points:

?	An increase of the net useful mass and volumetric energy density of the battery system between 10% and 30% compared to the state-of-the-art battery systems.
?	The improvement of the safety by design measures throughout the battery lifetime and during operation.
Projects are furthermore expected to deliver innovative thermal management to

?	Increase performance over the complete operational conditions
?	Enable fast charging requirements 10%-80% in 10 minutes maximum.
The solutions should be demonstrated and validated at application level and should comply with all relevant standards (performance and safety). They are also encouraged to contribute to standardisation of measures for safe thermal management.
Scope: Projects should achieve size and weight reduction by integrating different technologies such as:
?	Integration of advanced cell technologies/generations, sensing technologies,
?	The use of lightweight and multi-functional materials (including, but not limited to, the use of nanomaterials) and lightweight structures for battery casing.

Already available ?Review of safety and sustainability dimensions, aspects, methods, indicators, and tools?, under consultation ?Framework for the definition of criteria and evaluation procedure for chemicals and materials?.] will set a framework for assessing safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials and should be considered as a baseline for proposals.

?	Improvement of the cell to system ration by adopting innovative packaging approaches to enable smart battery cell concepts. Approaches to reduce the complexity of HV and BMS architecture and substitution by alternatives.
To reach those targets, improvements in both components in the cell and in the pack will be considered.
Proposals are expected to also address innovations in the manufacturing processes that result in size and weight reduction of the packs.
In addition, projects are expected to improve battery performance and safety by demonstrating innovative thermal management systems, which enhance fast charging capability or high- power application during operational lifetime (heating and cooling).
Finally, projects should enhance the safety throughout the full battery lifetime and for failure conditions by developing and demonstrating safe by design measures, for example such as:
?	Thermal propagation measures.
?	Fire retardant properties.
?	Mechanical properties ameliorations.
?	Reliability, default propagation/thermal runaway modelisation and simulation.
The effectiveness of safety measures should be demonstrated by simulation at pack level.

The projects are to focus on the battery system level, i.e., on the integration of battery cells into a battery system (e.g., a battery pack), considering mechanical, electrical and thermal aspects.
The integration of battery systems into larger systems of application (e.g., into vehicles structure) can be part of scope (e.g. cell to casing integration) as long as it can be demonstrated as a possibility to reduce overall packaging space, battery weight and battery performance improvement.
All solutions are expected to consider optimal design for manufacturing, end of life management and LCA analysis and disassembly.

?	Shortening the development time of battery cells and battery systems by minimising the experimental testing effort and thus reducing the overall costs and time in battery system development and reducing the time to market.
?	Increasing the battery reliability and safety through better understanding of the ageing, reliability and safety-relevant mechanisms and phenomena.
?	Supporting the uptake of zero emission vehicles and the deployment of stationary energy storage systems (ESS) through safer and cost-effective battery systems.

?	Fostering innovations in the eco-system battery through accelerated and more reliable verification and validation of advanced solutions contributing to increased user acceptability (safety & costs) and competitiveness of the European battery value chain.
?	Standardisation of battery system testing & validation approaches focussing on the fusion of physical and virtual test methodologies.
Scope: This call aims to reduce the development cost and time to market of battery systems by accelerated multi-physical and virtual testing. Current test strategies are still very time consuming and costly due to the need to understand the impact of multi-physical operational loads (electric, thermal, mechanical, ?), potential failure modes, ageing and misuse on the safety and reliability of battery cells, modules and systems level. For overcoming these barriers, new multi-physical test strategies supplemented by virtual testing are required deepening the understanding of factors impacting ageing, reliability and safety and their dependencies.
This call complements the previous call HORIZON-CL5-D2-2022-01-07 focusing on the digitisation of battery testing. To differentiate, research activities should focus on the orchestration of accelerated testing and should result in a coherent test strategy from cell to system as much as possible independent from chemistries and technologies applicable also to next-generation batteries. Proposals can address mobile as well as stationary applications and should address and demonstrate at least following activities:
?	Understanding and describing the impact of multi-physical operational loads, failure modes, ageing and misuse on battery reliability and safety highlighting the dependencies between them in order to design the most adequate testing methods and parameters. This includes deeper understanding of aging and degradation mechanisms induced by accelerated tests both on batteries safety performance and cycle-life to optimise the testing strategy.
?	Deriving advanced operating profiles for testing and development of novel X-in-the- Loop (XiL) test environments for multi-physical and accelerated testing addressing electrical, thermal and mechanical loads at the same time. This includes the design of specimen mountings representing real-life conditions.
?	Combining physics-based with data-driven test strategies enabling reliable virtual and distributed battery testing from cell to system taking into account specific applications. This includes developing methodologies for accelerated model convergence mixing digital and XiL test results as well as of decision-making algorithms for automated test definition and execution.
?	Development of simplified test strategies reducing the number of test and their complexity while improving battery safety and reliability. This includes on the fly testing protocols to facilitate/accelerate the parametrisation as well as the testing of aged or damaged batteries. Synergies between different battery chemistry, including next

generation battery designs and sizes should be exploited allowing to re-use or scale test results from cell to system level.
?	Research activities should also lead to advance response strategies for damaged and aged batteries as well as should contribute to an European-wide safety classification system for safety. For the latter, the development of concepts for such a safety classification system are being expected.
Activities could be complemented by following aspects:

?	Development of virtual methods to reduce the complexity of testing sample to sub- system DUTs (device under test) while full system is validated by virtual methods using the results from physical sub-system test.
?	Development, exploitation, and harmonisation of advanced battery cell/pack measurement & diagnostic methods for enhancing the data depth and breadth over what is currently available. Development of performance indicators relating to battery degradation and safety and methods / requirements for correlating / validating digital models.
?	Application of AI to the collected data at laboratory to redefine designed test matrix in order to improve the potential conclusions, to reduce the testing time and effort and in general, to enhance the applied testing methodology.
Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan).
To strengthen European battery production ecosystem, projects are encouraged to implement batteries produced in EU Member States/Associated countries at large or pilot plant scale.
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) whose contribution could consists of performing experimental or desk-top research on battery performance or safety.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Contribute to the implementation of the REPowerEU Plan, in particular to i) diversify gas supplies via higher levels of sustainable bio-methane (mainly based on organic waste and agricultural residues) and green hydrogen, and ii) speed up Europe?s path to independence from fossil fuels by increasing the share of renewable energy (electricity, heat and fuels) in the European energy consumption.
?	Increase the roll-out of local or regional renewable energy system solutions for electricity, heat and fuel needs and contribute to their market up-take in Europe.
?	Create new sustainable jobs linked to local or regional renewable energy system value chains and enhance economic growth in local or regional European communities.
?	Enhance security and autonomy of local or regional energy supply in EU Member States/Associated countries in current and future climate conditions.
?	Increase the readiness, reliability, performance and affordability of local or regional renewable energy system solutions in Europe.
Scope: The EU energy system strongly relies on centralised electricity generation and on fuel imports, with 95% of its oil and 84% of its gas consumption sourced from outside the EU. The REPowerEU Plan proposes a set of actions to reduce the EU?s dependence on fossil fuels and diversify its energy supply ?well before 2030?. The three pillars of the plan are to ramp up the production of green energy, diversify our energy supplies, and reduce our demand for fossil gas, coal and oil.
Renewable energy valleys are understood as decentralised renewable energy systems that offer a viable and efficient solution to the challenges mentioned above. For example, local production and consumption, reduced transmission and distribution losses thanks to the reliance on local networks for energy needs, greater operational flexibility and reduced dependence on expensive fuel imports all contribute to a higher energy autonomy, a more secure supply, and lower, more stable overall energy costs, including for individual citizens. In addition, this alleviates a part of the load on the centralised grid and avoids blockages by the capacity of the grid.
Proposals are expected to address the following aspects:

?	Creation of a renewable energy valley ?living lab? in local, peri-urban or regional communities that demonstrates in real life conditions the sustainable and cost-effective

production and storage of renewable energy from different local renewable energy sources providing multiple renewable energy carriers (e.g., electricity, heat, renewable fuels, bio-methane, biogas, hydrogen), fully covering the local energy needs on an annual basis.
?	Consideration of different potentials in terms of geography, climate and natural resources in the concept design.
?	Consideration of different end users (e.g. buildings, mobility, industry, industrial parks) of the multiple renewable energy carriers.
?	Reduction of energy use and energy losses through the integration of effective and innovative energy-efficient solutions.
?	Development and testing of a digital twin of the specific local energy grid for all types of energy carriers (i.e., electricity, heat, fuels including gases) for operational analysis, detailed energy forecasting and local grid management.
?	Scenario analysis using the digital twin to constantly improve multiple carrier grid management, planning, data gathering/handling and cyber security.
?	Development of cost-effective upscaling and commercialisation approaches of the solutions, linked to robust business models along the value chains, considering inclusive and affordable access to energy for consumers. This can include collaborative ventures with local stakeholders.
?	Regarding the development of the renewable energy technologies value chains, fostering the participation of the local industry and other stakeholders, including citizens, Energy Communities and the Energy Communities Repository 151 as appropriate, therefore generating local jobs, skills, economic growth and benefits for citizens. Where applicable, synergies with other economic sectors than the energy sector may be considered.
?	Regarding the local or regional renewable energy system developed, assessment of its stability, robustness, and fitness to the local resources and needs, including understanding consumer behaviour.
?	Assessment of costs avoidance from fossil fuels imports in line with REPowerEU to decrease the dependence on such imports.
?	Assessment - both at the design phase and during operation - of environmental and socio-economic impacts (positive and negative) for the local community or region, and development of measures to mitigate the negative impacts.
The renewable energy valleys can take diverse configurations, such as peri-urban settings, (agro-) industrial clusters or remote or islanded areas. They can also take the form of either

distinct but combined systems or unique poly-generation systems (i.e., in the same infrastructure) to deliver multiple energy carriers from combined renewable energy resources and technologies.
The proposal should indicate how the operation and maintenance of the living lab will be guaranteed after the end of the project.
Technological developments for hydrogen production and storage are addressed in the frame of the Clean Hydrogen European Partnership and are therefore excluded from this call, but proposals may include the integration of such devices in the demonstration.
Proposals are expected to foresee coordination and collaboration with similar EU-funded projects (in particular, those that will be funded under this topic) for policy relevant issues such as regulatory framework, business models and obstacles to innovation.",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D3-01-02, PV integration in buildings and in infrastructure,3/30/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 8.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Photovoltaic products are considered to be building-integrated, if they have been designed following the basic requirements for construction works in order to form and/or replace a construction product. If the integrated PV product is dismounted, it would have to be replaced by an appropriate conventional construction product. Building and infrastructure integrated PV can be a cost-effective, technologically proven solution to decarbonise buildings and infrastructure.
Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Demonstrate economic and sustainable PV integration in the built environment and infrastructure.
?	Establish enhanced structural collaborative innovation between PV companies and the (building) construction sector.
?	Contribute to the Renovation Wave, the Mission on climate-neutral and smart Cities and the New European Bauhaus initiative.
Scope: PV integration in buildings and in infrastructure unlocks a huge potential for renewable electricity generation. Integrated PV require individual solutions in order to meet multi-functional and aesthetic requirements such as yield-friendly colouring or modular transparency, antifouling property, structural flexibility, module lightness and flexibility, suited voltage levels, the use of and combination with (building) materials other than glass, and an overall high aesthetical value that addresses the requirements of architects and designers.
Proposals are expected to:

?	Demonstrate resilience against partial shading, the interconnection of PV modules that have different sizes, specific optical and thermal control solutions, long service life/easy replacement, safety and simplicity of maintenance, software control for quick detection of faults, module substructures and fixing systems to enhance aesthetics and functionality of the integration solution and electricity yield.
?	Decrease costs and enhance lifetime, quality, reliability and sustainability with new approaches for both PV module and BOS with the development of industrialized mass- production of customized products and development of prefabricated solutions that incorporate an integrated life cycle approach.
?	Develop energy integration and social behaviour concepts to maximize the energy matching between PV production and local buildings consumption, supported by new tools and business models to ensure their economic effectiveness.
?	Demonstrate integration of PV design and manufacturing within the construction value chain with appropriate consideration to standards for buildings and infrastructure, as well as contribution to new and improved standards.
?	Form alliances between all stakeholders (PV and building/construction sectors, distribution system operators, investors, owners, architects, installers) to tackle a number of educational and regulatory barriers that still hinder the development of integrated PV in buildings and infrastructure. The goal is to promote new concepts/schemes and business models for an active role of integrated PV in renovation and construction.
Demonstrations are expected to be carried out in more than one different construction typologies (residential buildings, tertiary building [hospitals, schools, public administration

buildings, etc.]), or civil infrastructures (roadways, noise barriers, parking lots, bridges, etc.) and in more than one locations in Europe.

To this end, it is important to enhance affordability, sustainability and exploit the modularity and synergies of application of PV technologies.
Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Expand the potential application and minimise the environmental impact of Floating PV (FPV) technology for inland and offshore waters.



152	https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en

?	Significant improvement of FPV designs that reduce both CAPEX and OPEX, maximize energy output and reduce LCoE.
Scope: Floating PV (FPV) has huge potential in areas where difficult terrain or land constraints make ground-mounted systems impractical. However, FPV also face a plethora of challenges for various environmental conditions such as wind, wave, currents, and water level variations that could adversely affect the electrical output and life of the plant.
Proposals are expected to:

?	Develop (and verify) predictive yield models including dynamic behaviour of the PV including floats, temperature effects and wave induced mismatch losses, depending on the application environment (wave height class) and scale of implementation.
?	Demonstrate advanced module and system concepts of adequate scale (min 5 MW) for electrical output optimisation considering the disturbance of environmental factors to the electrical output characteristics of PV modules and systems.
?	Demonstrate system components that satisfy the structural and functional requirements for the entire lifecycle (coping with soiling and fouling, degradation, corrosion, environmental stress cracking, UV stabilisation, exposure to water, salinity, humidity, algae growth, toxicity). Address reliability and performance loss rates through the development of accelerated stress testing specifically for FPV applications, operational data, and visual inspection of FPV systems.
?	Demonstrate low impact on ecosystem biodiversity by developing methodologies (models, monitoring?) and guidelines to assess the direct impacts of FPV on aquatic systems and biodiversity and consider potential mitigation measures.
?	Satisfy end-of-life recycling aspects.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D3-01-04, Solar Systems for Industrial Process Heat and Power,3/30/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 7.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Renewable energy integration in the industrial sector is a key step in achieving low-carbon production systems. Solar systems for industrial process heat and power are gaining attention towards this goal and have the potential for significant scale up, particularly in areas that combine a large and diverse industrial sector with rich solar resources. Therefore, project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
?	Energy efficient solar resource integration in the industrial sector for achieving low- carbon, emission-free production systems.
Scope: Industrial processes need considerable amounts of heat and power. Much of the demand for process heat, roughly 50% among the most energy-intensive manufacturing industries, including food and beverages and pulp and paper, occurs at temperatures of 400 øC or less. The Solar Thermal (ST) medium-temperature process heat or cogeneration with electricity can be an effective way to transition to clean energy sources and displace conventional fossil fuel use in industry. On the other side, Photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sun-light to direct current (DC) electricity and the electricity can be used to power or heat industrial processes directly (or via the grid) with electric heating technologies. The two solar technologies (PV and ST) are not competing but can be suitably integrated in an energy system to best benefit of the different features offered by the two options. This high synergy output would allow a useful integration of solar in many industrial processes.
Proposals are expected to:

?	Demonstrate a system that considering solar energy's generation potential, topographic characteristics, land-use constraints and system performance, generates solar medium- temperature heat and electricity in a modular, low environmental footprint, low cost and high-efficiency hybrid PV and ST design. Optimize the manufacturing processes based on the process integration concept (presenting opportunities for energy efficiency and heat recovery) and process control, to reduce process power and heat demand to its practical minimum for an energy efficient solar energy supply (possibly including storage) investment.

?	Demonstrate the potential of hybrid approaches (PV and ST) that produce heat and electricity to power a broad range of manufacturing end uses.

?	Reduced use of primary raw materials and reduced dependency on scarce raw materials.
?	Reduction of LCOE and increased sustainability.

Scope: The objective is to bring major innovations in the design and manufacturing of large offshore wind farms, aiming at >15 MW for fixed bottom offshore applications and >12 MW for floating offshore installations.
Attention can be paid to substantially reducing the wind turbine mass (rotor/nacelle/tower) as well as on advanced lean marine-compatible substructures, advanced (dynamic) cabling and connectors, including floating platforms and its moorings. Innovations such as compact generators, smart blades, reliable drive trains, can be investigated alongside new turbine designs. Innovative low-cost substructures with suitable geotechnical and hydro-dynamic properties should be developed using long-lasting, anti-fouling, corrosion resistant materials with high damping properties.
The projects should exploit improved understanding of the issues related to materials in the upscaling of wind energy turbines/systems (stresses and strains, delamination, etc.)
The innovations should contribute to sustainability considering circularity in the design phase, less (or no) use of (critical) raw materials and decreasing negative environmental and social impacts. They should also contribute to the mitigation of the possible impacts to protected species and habitats.
Such development will allow further deployment of offshore wind energy conversion systems and dramatically increase the offshore wind potential while reducing public acceptability barriers (noise, visual impact).
The active participation of relevant industrial partners and technology suppliers is essential to form a multisectoral, multidisciplinary consortium able to achieve the full impact of the project.

Scope: Demonstration of sustainable tidal energy pilot farms (minimum 4 MW installed capacity and at least 4 devices) in full operational conditions for long periods of time is essential to advance this sector. It is the way to bridge the gap from technology development to market development while reducing costs, reducing risks and attracting investors for future commercial projects. The farm is expected to be composed of several devices of the same series.
The tidal energy farms have to be connected to the electricity grid. To focus on the technologies with the greatest chances of success, the single tidal device to be used in the array deployment is expected to be satisfactorily demonstrated at full scale before, with limited changes to incorporate the learnings. Any change on the tidal device may be incremental but should not involve fundamental changes to the device design or composition.? The innovation component should mainly lie on the pilot farm systems and supporting industrial manufacturing activities that enable a cost-effective and high-performance pilot farm.

The project proposal is expected to present a

clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration actions and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project is expected also to demonstrate how it will get a financial close for the whole action. For this the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered. Independent experts will assess all deliverables and will advise for the go/no-go decision.
The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).
Data from the pilot structures should be collected to understand the performance and behaviour of the structure and the surrounding environmental condition, to optimise the concept and understand the environmental impact of tidal energy harvesting.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D3-01-09, Waste heat reutilisation from data centres,3/30/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:

154	https://www.h2020-bridge.eu/

?	Make sustainable seasonal storage solutions available to data centres to allow year-round optimised operation in urban environments in an integrated way to supply heat to neighbouring district heating system(s), agriculture and/or industry optimising use of excess heating energy and required cooling energy.
Storage solutions with high round-trip efficiency, low dependence on critical raw materials, low land/space footprint will be considered as advantage.
Scope: Two main obstacles arise in relation to the reuse of waste heat from data centres:

?	First, data centres produce more waste heat in summer/when it is hot outside. The PUE (Power use effectiveness) of data centres vary considerably along the year, because in winter they can resort to free cooling (using fresh air from the outside), while in summer they need to ventilate more and use heat pumps to cool down the outside air. As a result, an important part of data centres? waste heat is produced when less people need it (at least for domestic heating purposes).
?	Second, the heat produced is of poor quality (low temperatures and often light heat vector), so that even for immediate use it is often not economically viable to use heat pumps to ?concentrate? it (increase temperature and, if necessary, communicate it to a heavier vector).
Combining waste heat reuse with heat storage would allow data centres to better valorise their waste heat in winter (under the form of residential heating for instance) while storing this heat during hotter periods. From an economic perspective, the increase of waste heat that can be valorised and sold by the data centre during the appropriate seasons may partially compensate the additional costs of cooling during summer months. Such technologies may subsequently apply to other industries generating important amounts of low temperature ? low density heat.
Selected projects will test and further develop seasonal heat storage technologies through an integrated pilot that includes at least the following technologies:
?	Heating and cooling exchange system for the data centre and the district heating system.
?	Seasonal energy storage.
For efficiency purposes, the storage technology should be able to store the heat for a long time (up to 6 months), with as little energy losses as possible, and using as few compressor steps as possible. The storage technology should also be non-hazardous and be deployable close to dwelling areas without posing a threat to them. Additionally, a specific consideration should be given to the cyber-physical security of the combined storage and restitution system.
Optionally, the project could involve heat pump manufacturers to explore the benefits of heat pump technologies to the overall heat storage facility.
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for

scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).",

?	Increase the reliability of the energy system by enhancing flexibility and efficiency of the European electricity grid to make it ready for the needed drastic increase of the renewable energy share and more resilient to future shocks (such as cyber-attacks) through scenario analysis and modelling.

?	Improve the data exchange between TSOs and DSOs and between network operators and the market players, leveraging data exchange from prosumers.
?	Creation of new services for companies and public authorities based on the digital twin.

Scope: To deal with the rising complexity of the Energy System(s), and the impact of the fast- changing energy market reality on the energy system, a digital twin of the electricity grid is a key digital solution to support network operators and market players in performing a well- informed decision-making. It is key tool to accelerate the innovation cycle and to reduce the inertia of the energy sector when it comes to the integration of digital solutions in the energy system in order to make it more efficient, resilient and able to integrate higher shares of renewable energies. Digital transformation of the energy system is thus essential to meet the objectives of REPowerEU.
The project is expected to address all of the following:

?	Create, develop and test a Digital Twin of the Electricity Grid that covers dynamic monitoring, (smart) grid planning, secure operation, forecasting and scenario analysis.
?	It has to be modular, interoperable and implementable at different scales, integrating both (decentralised) supply and demand-side, taking into account all relevant energy data.
?	Promote new ways for energy companies, to share data and break the data-silos - simplifying the data maintenance and exchange process - through a dynamic monitoring of the whole system.
?	Synchronize data from various systems, including at least 5 TSO, 5 DSO and 5 market parties that are not related in terms of ownership and with varying levels of infrastructure maturity.
?	Standardize it into one multi-user platform via standards-based adapters/interfaces, compliant and integrated with the Common European Energy Data Space.
?	Use the Digital twin for multi-facetted resilience scenario analysis to investigate how the electricity grid responds to stimuli or shocks (e.g. RES integration, cyber-attacks) and what answers can be provided.
?	Test and pilot the applications of science and innovation in the energy sector (e.g. testing the combination of key digital technologies such as High Performance Computing, Big Data, AI, IoT and Cloud Computing) in order to foster the rapid development new services based on them [e.g. Load Balancing, Power Management, Consumer Services, Demand forecasting real time and interactive computing]. These new services should help to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the EU energy system.
?	Involve key organisations to ensure a European approach is required. In particular, ENTSOe and EUDSO, set up in line with the Electricity Directive, as well as main stakeholders such as T&D Europe, Eurelectric, SmartEn, etc.
To ensure interoperability and integration into the grid and the federated European digital infrastructure, specific demonstrators will make use of operational end-to-end architectures, digital platforms and other data exchange infrastructure for the energy and cross-sector

systems being developed under ongoing Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe as well as under other EU programs such as the Digital Europe Program and Connecting Europe Facility.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D3-01-17, Development of CO2 transport and storage demo projects,3/30/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 20.00-2,"Expected Outcome: The demo project is expected to use the CO2 from one or more capture sites and build or use a transport infrastructure, incl. shipping if needed, to the selected storage site where the CO2 will be injected. Practical experience with a demo project of that kind will increase the knowledge of the full CCS value chain including risk mitigation (financial, technical, and regulatory) taking into account the experience and results from previous research projects. Beside others this might include
for CO2 transport:

?	impact of CO2 origin, composition and impurities
?	safety assessments and engineering design tools
?	transport of CO2 interoperability, including ships
?	reuse of pipelines, wells and platforms
?	hubs and clusters and concepts
?	environmental impacts and risks
?	CO2 flow assurance for CO2 storage:
?	preparation of storage sites (depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers, basalt rocks)
?	develop experience with site conformance monitoring and assessment
?	storage optimisation through development of a range of injection strategies
?	improve understanding of induced seismicity
?	prediction of plume under geophysical and geological uncertainty
?	flexibility of CO2 injection ramp up
?	environmental impacts and risks, including in the long term
The demo project is expected to be the basis and orientation for future full-size projects.

Scope: The development of regional CCUS clusters and their connection to European CO2 transport and storage infrastructures that enables cross-border cooperation across regions is crucial for reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The CCUS technology is not sufficiently operational in Europe yet. To overcome the remaining challenges, further R&I of CO2 transport and storage demo projects is needed.
Proposals will aim at the development of new demonstration projects connecting CO2 sources with potential storage sites. Proposals are expected to include a sound assessment of their

environmental challenges and risks and feasibility studies focusing on the possible synergies between related projects.
CCUS is an integrated chain of technologies, comprising capture, transportation and/or use and geological storage of CO2. The next step in the application of CCUS is the development and deployment of CO2 transport and storage demo projects which show the practical feasibility of the required technologies. This is important to achieve greater efficiency in the transportation of CO2, notably collecting the emissions from hubs and clusters of industrial facilities and transporting the collective CO2 in shared open-access transportation infrastructure to a storage location. Under this approach, costs, risks and necessary support mechanisms can be better evaluated across the CCS value chain, as industrial installations, gas infrastructure companies and storage providers and operators will have clearly defined roles and responsibilities for delivering their tasks and will be compensated for collecting, transport and storage services. The benefits of the shared approach to the transport and storage infrastructure are expected to be evaluated with regard to economies of scale and possibly driving down unit costs for the CCUS value chain. The proposal should address possible barriers for deployment of technical or regulatory nature.
The key options for CO2 transportation are pipeline transport using new or repurposed infrastructure incl. shipping or other transport modes. The expected demo projects should
?	assess the repurposing of existing pipeline networks and/or the creation of new CO2 transport infrastructure,
?	identify and evaluate the benefits and costs (including economic, environmental, social),
?	identify barriers to developing such an infrastructure and what action would be required to overcome these.
A successful CO2 transport and storage demo project might require a European transport and storage network with cross-border connections as not all countries have sufficient storage capacity for their CO2 emissions.
The selection of the storage site for the project is expected to be based on a detailed assessment. This should include a geological characterisation, including faults and facture systems; analysis of initial stress field and geo-mechanical behaviour of the storage formations and seals under varying stress and pore-pressure conditions; estimation of storage capacity; accurate modelling of injectivity; overall storage risk assessment, including induced seismicity and blow-out or blockage during injection, and including proposed mitigation action. The assessment should include site-specific solutions for CO2 injection strategies, pressure management, mitigation of induced seismicity, and MMV (measurement, monitoring and verification).
For CO2 transport and geological storage, in particular onshore, public acceptability is paramount. Therefore, projects are expected to identify and engage relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) in deliberative activities, so as to analyse their concerns and needs

using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities. This should include attention to, significant differences in potential regional consequences where the CO2 stored comes from power versus industry. Projects, therefore, could consider the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise in order to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities.
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).

Scope: The Clean Energy Transition co-funded Partnership (CET Partnership) is a transnational initiative on joint R&I programming to boost and accelerate the energy transition, building upon regional and national R&I funding programmes.
It aims at empowering the energy transition and contribute to the EU?s goal of becoming the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, by pooling national and regional R&I funding for a broad variety of technologies and system solutions required to make the transition. It will foster transnational innovation ecosystems from the very local and regional level, up to the transnational European level, thus overcoming a fragmented European landscape. The CET Partnership enables national and regional R&I programme owners and managers from Member States and Associated Countries to align their priorities and implement annual joint calls from 2022 to 2027. They also organise joint accompanying activities to enable a dynamic learning process, extract strategic knowledge and maximise the impact to accelerate the upscaling, replication and market diffusion of innovative solutions. This will foster the up- take of cost-effective clean energy technologies.
The common vision of the CET Partnership is already manifested in its Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) that has been co-created with the involved countries, the EU SET Plan Implementation Working Groups and ETIPs, all energy relevant ERA-Nets as well

as the EERA joint programmes (over 500 editors, co-authors, commenters and discussants). The SRIA articulates the common goal of (1) building a transnational transformative Joint Programming Platform, (2) developing and demonstrating technology and solutions for the transition of energy systems, and finally (3) building innovation ecosystems that support capacity building at all levels.
The outcome of this action will result in an amendment of grant agreement 101069750 [the existing grant agreement] to increase its budget. This type of amendment is exceptional and will apply exclusively to co-funded European Partnerships.

Scope: Power take-off (PTO) and control systems (including ""prime mover"" (waves to mechanical power) as well as the ancillary equipment like gearboxes, generators, and power electronics, power controllers, grid interfaces and other items) are key subsystems of wave energy converters. PTO and control systems can be improved to increase the efficiency of the whole converter, to increase reliability by controlling for instance the structuring health and power electronics, and to avoid extreme events that might compromise device survivability. Control systems dynamically adapt to and mitigate the forces of the continually changing ocean conditions. This can prevent damage during extreme events, contribute to increased performance and the viability of the technology. The manufacturing and testing of prototypes are relatively costly, and it is imperative that data from the demonstration are available to avoid repeating early engineering mistakes. Validation of the innovative concepts is expected to be done in realistic environments at small scale for longer periods or by onshore testing and controlled lab testing. If validation is done onshore the project should demonstrate that they can make use of existing test rigs or develop a test rig for the project, which can be used after the project by other developers.

?	Accurate and precise energy yield prediction to ease investment decisions based on accurate simulations that take into account simultaneously predictions on Renewable Energy Production, Energy Consumption and Price Predictions.
?	Enhanced digital transformation of wind energy sector by delivering the next generation of digital twins.
Scope: The expected growth of both on-and offshore wind energy is enormous and many new wind parks are planned for the coming years. Experience from the existing wind farms shows the importance of a proper micrositing of the wind turbines as well their efficient interconnection within the farm. In addition, bringing wind farms together into clusters toward a wind power plant concept might induce long distance negative interaction between the farms, reducing their expected efficiency. This might happen both on- and offshore. The high amount of connected wind power and the expected increase during the coming years, requires that this technology has to be prepared to take a more important role as of its contribution to the reliability and security of the electricity system. The objective of this topic is to develop new digital twins to optimise the exploitation of individual wind farms (onshore, bottom-fixed offshore and floating offshore) as well as wind farm clusters, in view of transforming them into virtual power plants delivering a more reliable and secure electricity system. Such a digital twin is expected to integrate [at least three of the following bullet points]:
1.	Wind and weather forecast models relevant for the full wind power production system (turbines, grid, transmission) (including the effects of external physical conditions such as temperatures, rain, turbulences, waves, and currents).

2.	Spatial modelling: medium (within wind farms) to long distance (between/along wind farm clusters) wake effects.
3.	Interconnection optimisation via simulations to satisfy grid connection requirements and agility in grid reconfiguration and provide ancillary services.
4.	Include predictive maintenance, structural health and conditional monitoring, and

5.	End user location and needs.

The digital twin will improve accurate energy yield prediction and will balance supply and demand side needs and will help to ease investment decisions based on accurate simulations. The models should incorporate other relevant parameters influencing the siting of wind farms, such as ground conditions, noise impacts and environmental impacts as well as representing the complex system in a map view format while considering time series data of each and every asset. Infrastructure modelling of each and every asset should be executed via independent profiling based on past performance data and contextual data in view to deliver prediction at the level of each and every asset with as much accuracy as possible?.
The project should focus on offshore or on onshore wind power systems and make optimal use of previously developed models. Validation should be carried out with data of existing wind farms. Cooperation with wind energy suppliers, OEM?s, developers and O&M services can make the available data more accurate, resulting in better, more sustainable and eventually circular products and sector. The project should also sufficiently invest in delivering a cyber-secure system. The projects is expected to build also on the digital twins developed under Destination Earth, which envisage to develop a high precision digital model of the Earth to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena and related human activities.
For the offshore digital twin projects the impact of other blue economy sectors, islands, different land-sea interactions for near shore wind farms should be considered.

Scope: Demonstration of sustainable wave energy pilot farms (minimum 2.0 MW installed capacity and at least 4 devices) in full operational conditions for long periods of time is essential to advance this sector. It is the way to bridge the gap from technology development to market development while reducing costs, reducing risks and attracting investors for future commercial projects. The farms should be composed of several devices of the same type.
The wave energy farms have to be connected to the electricity grid. To focus on the technologies with the greatest chances of success, the single wave energy device to be used in the array deployment is expected to be satisfactorily demonstrated at full scale before, with limited changes to incorporate the learnings. Any change on the wave energy device may be incremental but should not involve fundamental changes to the device design or composition. The innovation component should mainly lie on the pilot farm systems and supporting

industrial manufacturing activities that enable a cost-effective and high-performance pilot farm. Where established, stage-gate processes can help ensure that this approach is followed.
The project is expected to deploy a wave energy farm with a minimum capacity of 2 MW and operate the farm at least 2 years in the lifetime of the project. After the project it is expected that the farm will continue to be operated for at least 8 years. The project should develop and execute an effective operation and maintenance programme.

?	Industrial design and manufacturing processes including set up of an industrial supply chain, circularity of (critical) raw materials, sustainability, scalability, installation methods, transport, operation & maintenance, supply chains and the related digital infrastructures.
?	Projects are requested to demonstrate the technologies at sea while respecting existing environmental regulatory framework. Necessary mitigation measures should be integrated to protect habitats and species. Present an environmental monitoring plan to be implemented during the demonstration action. Environmental monitoring data should be open source and be shared with EMODNET and the IEA OES environmental task.
The project has to include a clear go/no go moment ahead of entering the deployment phase. Before this go/no-go moment, the project has to deliver the detailed engineering plans, a techno-economic assessment, including key performance indicators based on international recognized metrics, a complete implementation plan and all needed permits for the deployment of the project., The project proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to obtaining necessary permits for the demonstration actions and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project is expected also to demonstrate how it will get a financial close for the whole action. For this the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered. Independent experts will assess all deliverables and will advise for the go/no-go decision.
The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).
Data from the pilot structures should be collected to understand the performance and behaviour of the structure and the surrounding environmental condition to optimise the concept and understand the environmental impact of wave energy harvesting.

There are still some scientific and technological challenges to overcome to be able to exploit CO2 as a fuel feedstock, the main challenge being that the utilisation of CO2 is limited by the highly energy intensive conversion process.
New solutions for the conversion of captured CO2 from different sources to fuels will create new markets for innovative industrial sectors and diversify the economic base in carbon- intensive regions, as well as contribute to achieving a Circular Economy. The project should evaluate the possibility for industrial CO2 use/reuse through the combination of processes (industrial symbiosis) and the efficient integration of CO2 capture and conversion to combine and/or reduce stages.
Scope: Proposals will aim at the development of energy-efficient and economically and environmentally viable CO2 conversion technologies, including energy storage and/or displacement of fossil fuels that allow for upscaling in the short to medium term. Proposals have to define ambitious but achievable targets for energy requirements of the conversion process (including catalytic conversion), production costs and product yields that will be used to monitor project implementation. Proposals have to include the potential for the proposed CCU solution(s) as CO2 mitigation option through conducting an LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) in line with guidelines developed by the Commission, such as the Innovation Fund GHG methodology and the relevant ISO standards and the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
Technology development has to be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) will be identified in the proposal, and involved in deliberative activities, so as understand and address their concerns and needs. This will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society?s readiness for the proposed solutions. Projects, therefore, could consider the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise in order to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities.

Under the European Green Deal, the Commission has also adopted a zero-pollution action plan, with a zero-pollution ambition, and a Biodiversity Strategy. In view of achieving these ambitious targets it is appropriate to further explore the development of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) as CO2 capture technologies in combination with CO2 storage, duly assessing their impacts on other environmental challenges.
The project is expected to develop highly innovative CCUS /carbon negative technologies leading to CO2 removal. It should enable the cost-effective deployment of technologies such as (DACCS), (BECCS) ideally linking them to industrial clusters with special emphasis of these technologies to safe CO2 underground storage and CO2 utilisation.
Project results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:

?	Improve existing or develop new materials for DACCS and/or BECCS technologies; or
?	Address potential barriers to the incorporation of DACCS and/or BECCS technologies in existing CC(U)(S) concepts; or
?	Make DACCS and/or BECCS technologies a viable option to make the EU carbon neutral by increasing the TRL levels and reducing cost of the different technological options
Scope: This topic focusses on DACCS and BECCS, which are technologies that can help reaching climate neutrality by 2050 by creating the carbon sinks required to balance out residual emissions in 2050.
The scope of this topic is to further the technological development of DACCS and BECCS, and addressing the environmental, social and economic challenges and benefits with the view

of establishing this concept as a viable technology to fight climate change. The potential technologies require major technological breakthroughs.
Projects have to substantiate the potential for the proposed solutions as CO2 mitigation option by conducting an LCA in conformity with guidelines developed by the Commission, such as the Innovation Fund GHG methodology and the relevant ISO standards and the EU Taxonomy Regulation. This life cycle consideration should include the sustainability of biomass and the renewable origin of electricity but also assess other environmental dimensions (requirements for land, water; impacts on air and water quality, biodiversity; distances to major storage clusters, leakages etc.).
Technology development has to be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) will be identified in the proposal and involved in deliberative activities to understand and address their concerns and needs. This will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society?s readiness for the proposed solutions. Projects, therefore, could consider the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise in order to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities. Projects should also explore the socio-economic and political barriers to acceptability and awareness with a view to regulatory or policy initiatives and include aspects of circularity and best use of resources.
Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).
Proposals that include research into the use of direct air capture and BECCS for enhanced oil recovery will not be considered. Proposals are expected to take into account the related activities within the EU ETS Innovation Fund and the EU Catalyst Partnership. International cooperation with Mission Innovation countries is encouraged in line with the CDR Mission.
Successful projects will be encouraged to join the EU CCUS knowledge sharing project network",

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D4-01-02, Future-proofing historical buildings for the clean energy transition,4/20/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 4.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Reduction of energy demand by at least 60%, preserving historical and cultural heritage values.
?	Reduction of on-site construction waste.
?	Improved lifetime renovation cost effectiveness compared to conventional renovation.
?	Improved comfort, Indoor Air Quality and Indoor Environmental Quality.
?	Significant reduction in maintenance costs.
?	Where possible, increased potential of successful installation of RES and improvement of smart readiness, in a way that respects the specificities of historical buildings.
?	Increased effectiveness and potential for replicability of the proposed solutions.
Scope: Around a quarter of the existing building stock in Europe was built prior to the middle of the last century. Many such buildings not only reflect the unique character and identity of European cities, but also include essential infrastructure for housing, public buildings etc. A significant number of these have a poor energy performance, continue to use conventional and inefficient fossil fuel-based energy systems and are costly to renovate. Furthermore, changes in building use and higher indoor comfort expectations than in the past are driving up energy demand, a particular challenge when historical buildings are used or converted for residential, educational, retail, office or other purposes. Many recently developed renovation approaches are not adapted to the specific requirements of historical buildings. The process of future- proofing these buildings for the clean energy transition faces additional challenges compared to newer buildings, as it has to take into account architectural restrictions, as well as the specificities of the materials used in their construction, which does not respond well to renovation techniques used in modern buildings.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following:

?	Deliver standardised renovation approaches and solutions for the deep renovation of historical buildings to improve their energy performance, smart readiness, indoor air quality, comfort, and climate resilience, while respecting their architectural and cultural specificities, materials and traditional construction techniques.

?	Target building types constructed prior to 1945 that have restrictions regarding changes of their envelope (walls, window, doors, and/or roof). (Buildings of nationally or internationally recognised significant cultural heritage built after this date may also be considered.).
?	Standardised renovation approaches and solutions that are directly replicable for other buildings of the same building type, which should represent a share of at least 1% of buildings in the specific country where they are located.
?	Solutions that reduce energy demand in a cost-effective way.
?	Explore both internal and external insulation solutions, and where possible incorporating adaptable interventions, plug and play technical building systems, and/or renewable energy services.
?	Employ both novel and traditional construction materials and techniques, exploring ways to combine, adapt and improve them.
?	Improve the comfort of occupants and lower the maintenance costs for building owners.
?	Where applicable, involve relevant conservation authorities.
?	Validation of the solutions in a relevant environment (real-life or close to real-life) that:
?	Covers at least three different countries, with diverse climatic conditions.

?	Improved insight for future standardisation needs in relevant areas of influence (e.g. procurement, product design, manufacturing, services, cooling equipment, control equipment, buildings energy performance, operation, management, among others.) in order to facilitate further improvements and efficiencies in the relevant areas.
Scope: Energy consumption of IT systems equipment (e.g. server racks, server rooms) inside buildings is following a significant growth due to several factors. These factors include the increasing number of installed sensors and IoT devices, which feeds the need for big data handling and the increasing demand for more powerful and advanced equipment. Various voluntary and regulatory instruments have been implemented in the past years to try to mitigate the environmental footprint of a specific equipment/device or systems in isolation. However, often these instruments do not take into account real life performance, potential inefficiencies or synergies with other systems, operation under real life set-up and control conditions, or other constraints such as those from the building energy management practices, building automation and control systems, local regulations or rules. Moreover, there is potential to improve the self-assessment and self-optimisation functionalities at all levels.

?	Integration of renewable thermal energy sources or industrial waste heat into more energy-, emissions-, cost- and space-efficient conversion systems generating cold for several industrial sectors and processes, maximising primary energy savings and CO2 emission reduction compared to present state-of-the-art, thereby reducing fossil fuel imports dependency.

Scope: Increasing the efficiency of the cooling systems and reducing costs, coupling the cooling systems with renewable energy sources, and harnessing available industrial waste heat (including from data centres), can contribute to reduce the environmental impact and make the industrial sectors more competitive and less dependent on fossil fuel imports.
In order to reach this goal, all the following development areas need to be covered:

?	Improved tools for the planning and management of building assets and portfolios of buildings including energy management, environmental performance, renovation optimisation and investment planning.
?	Increased availability and access to lifecycle data of buildings and buildings portfolios and enhanced interoperability and synergies among data sharing platforms.
Scope: European buildings are producing an increasing amount of data on energy and non- energy uses. More and better data can lead to enhanced consumer information, contribute to an effective management of energy grids and support the creation of innovative energy services, new business models and financing schemes for distributed clean energy. Data is also a key enabler for reliable and effective policymaking, e.g. for climate policies. Several recent projects have focused on developing big data facilities and data analytics tools to monitor the energy performance of buildings based on energy related data. More work is needed to integrate energy data with lifecycle data (e.g. GHG emissions and removals, materials, water, health, comfort, life cycle cost and value, etc.), in order to optimise the performance of buildings and buildings? portfolios across the board and support the decision making of owners/tenants/developers to transform existing and planned physical assets (buildings or buildings? assets, e.g. distributed energy generation, e-mobility recharging infrastructure, micro-grids, building systems).
Proposals are expected to address at least two of the three following points:

?	Develop new or upgrade existing building management systems enhanced with data analytics and real-time digital twinning tools. The developed systems should take into account buildings monitoring data (e.g. from embedded sensors/actuators), users? preferences (e.g. related to comfort and well-being, safety, and energy flexibility), and surrounding environmental conditions (e.g. urban density, micro-climate, etc.) in order to optimise operational energy and environmental performance.
?	Develop new or upgrade existing decision support tools for the management of building assets and portfolios of buildings. The developed tools should be able to deliver energy (e.g. energy monitoring, renovation optimisation) and non-energy services (investment planning, risk assessment ? e.g. risk-related, fault detection, predictive maintenance, surveillance & safety, comfort, occupancy satisfaction). The tools should be co- developed with the potential users (e.g. facility managers, fund managers etc.) and tested in real market conditions.
?	Develop new or upgrade existing data sharing platforms including lifecycle data of buildings or buildings portfolios. The platforms should connect relevant market actors

(technology providers, developers, aggregators, DSOs, ESCOS) with relevant user groups (consumers, energy communities), policy makers and the financial sector and offer innovative services (e.g. flexibility, prediction, investment planning etc.). The platforms should be co-developed with the participation of the potential user groups and tested in real market conditions linking, where relevant, to digital logbooks and to and other relevant initiatives (e.g. the Smart Readiness Indicator under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive).
Proposals should contribute to the activities of the Built4People partners and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters.
Proposals are expected to implement at least three large -scale pilots to demonstrate the chosen system. The pilots should cover a variety of building typologies (residential, commercial, public etc.) and use cases (energy monitoring, renovation optimisation, investment planning, risk assessment etc.)

?	Better awareness of the challenges and benefits of alternative heating systems in the relevant industrial sectors.
Scope: Alternative forms of energy such as for example ultrasound, microwaves, plasma, infrared, visible and ultraviolet radiations ? are unconventional and contactless heat sources, that create the possibility of new, efficient and flexible processes, in that they are applied precisely where they are needed and with shortened reaction times. They are key enablers for switching processes from fossil energy to renewable or low-carbon energy sources, and can contribute to increasing their energy efficiency, thereby reducing fossil fuel imports dependency.
They provide higher production flexibility, allowing variable throughputs to better follow market demand and enabling leaner production paradigms (e.g. decreased stock, production on demand), as well as flexibility for the electricity grid via demand response. Furthermore, such technologies are suitable for downscaling, which can be an advantage in some cases (e.g. local waste or biomass feedstock processing).
Note: the electrification of furnaces to heat large volumes at very high temperatures is not in the scope of this topic, because it is covered in Cluster4 work programme.
Further research and upscaling work is necessary to demonstrate their potential to be deployed on an industrial scale.
In order to reach this goal all the following development areas are expected to be covered:

?	Cost effective and improved designs for at least two alternative heat sources technologies.
?	Integration and demonstration of the system at industrial scale of at least one alternative heat source technology in at least on industrial process; demonstrate the financial viability and develop a business case.
?	Make a preliminary estimation of the future equipment cost for at least one alternative heat source technology, in a total of at least three industrial applications (including the demonstrated application), to evaluate their economic potential.
?	Make an analysis of the potential industrial deployment and related benefits (technical, economic, climatic, environmental) of at least one alternative heat source technology in three industrial sectors, in the EU and (if data are available) in the Associated States and, by extrapolation, at global level.
?	Define an exploitation strategy. For proposals submitted under this topic, the plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).",

?	Greater engagement of representative groups of end users as well as citizens of the impacted urban context.
?	Increased acceptability and uptake of sustainable deep renovation solutions in the built environment.
?	Reduced energy and mobility poverty.
?	Increase in plans for climate neutral and sustainable, aesthetic and inclusive built environments with enhanced climate adaptation and resilience (e.g. based on nature- based solutions).
?	Enhanced climate change adaptation and resilience in built environments.
Scope: The transition to a climate-neutral society requires that Europe?s building stock also becomes climate-neutral. At the same time, Europe?s building stock has to become climate resilient. This requires a comprehensive approach beyond individual buildings, namely at the level of neighbourhoods or urban districts. However, the decarbonisation of the built environment and its adaptation to a changing climate and to societal needs in terms of comfort, accessibility, inclusiveness, and aesthetics cannot happen without active participation of the buildings? users and occupants, individual / collective property owners, and energy communities as beneficiaries of the value chain. Professionals, such as project developers, architects, engineers, building owners, planners and statutory authorities, require solutions that develop, analyse, model, visualise and present a multitude and complex set of information in such a way that facilitates such co-design processes. This topic focuses on the development of digital solutions for a stronger participation of end users, citizens and other relevant stakeholders in the design, planning and management of the renovation of existing buildings, neighbourhoods and / or districts.
Proposals are expected to address one or both of the following points:

?	Digital solutions that facilitate participative design and planning through visualisation, analysis and engagement with data that is directly relevant to building users as well as citizens in the surrounding urban area (including e.g. immersive and interactive technologies, Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality, simulations and scenario modelling).
?	Digital solutions that allow to analyse and model different scenarios for to-be-renovated buildings, neighbourhoods and / or districts in terms of energy use and generation; users? health and wellbeing; impact on the energy grid; provisions for active and electric mobility, and sustainable delivery solutions; life-cycle environmental and micro-climatic impacts, and; socio-economic impacts for citizens, building users, owners and occupiers.

In addition, proposals are expected to address all of the following:

?	Address aspects of climate-neutrality and climate-resilience, respecting the 'energy efficiency first? principle.
?	Ensure the digital solution complements, builds on and/or uses existing tools (including, where relevant, on conventional, low-tech ones) and standards recognised by the market.
?	Engage citizens (seeking coverage of different genders and social characteristics), end users of the tools and other relevant stakeholders involved in the design, planning and management of urban development projects in the development process of the digital solution.
?	Ensure the digital solution offers different means to exchange information and provide input that are tailored to the specific needs of laypersons, including vulnerable, minority and disadvantaged groups as well as persons with disabilities and older persons.
?	Demonstrate the prototype in at least three real-life urban development projects to apply, evaluate and refine the digital solution and inform its market launch and / or commercialisation strategy.
?	Ensure the project?s dissemination activities include actions that contribute to the activities of the NEB Community, and to sharing information, best practices and results within the NEB Lab.
?	Contribute to the activities of the Built4People partners and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters.

?	Improved control of battery operating conditions and determination of key state estimators (SoX = e.g. State of Health, State of Power, State of Safety, State of Charge) to increase accuracy and to improve the early warning capability for performance, reliability, safety, and lifetime issues on all battery system levels.
?	New simulation tools and test methods for faster development, validation and integration of the battery pack, considering assembly design (reducing cabling for the external voltage detection communication function) and realizing a reduction of testing time by 30% (collection of battery characteristics for SoX algorithm optimisation using less calibration).
?	Enhanced communication between battery and vehicle control unit for a more efficient battery operation by synchronizing the electronic control units (ECUs) of the BMS and the EV.
Scope: Advances in the design, functioning and data accessibility of an efficient battery management system (BMS) are of high significance when it comes to the integration of batteries in electric vehicles (passenger cars and commercial vehicles) and the general improvement of battery performance.

Scope: Urban spaces will be changing in the future. There will be a massive shift from the parking-lot culture in the city to recovery of living spaces as well as increasing intelligence in the urban spaces. Both will have a strong impact on individual means of mobility. New vehicle concepts that harmonize with these new developments, but also achieve widespread user-acceptability, will be needed. Platform concepts with sufficient variability will be able to meet the needs of both advanced and emerging countries.



246	The future Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design [Reference to be updated] will set a framework for assessing safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials and should be considered as a baseline for proposals.

Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:

?	Increasing the degree of circularity of EVs, thus reducing their environmental footprint over the full life cycle. As far as cells are concerned, however, these aspects are already developed in the Batt4EU partnership and are therefore not covered in this topic, but inputs can be used from running projects.
?	Increasing the awareness and acceptability of circular economy and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based design of innovative zero-emission solutions for the clean road transport challenge.
?	Contributing to a harmonised way of measuring the circularity of the economy in the automotive industry.

?	Demonstrating the potential of these actions by delivering a circular car prototype (test bench ready) aiming at 0% virgin material use by mass for all vehicle components except cells, e-machines and electronics.
?	Accelerating the transformation of Europe towards being the first digitally enabled, circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy.
?	Contributing to Europe?s world leadership in automotive innovation, production and services through increasing skills with circular economy techniques and accelerating the uptake of innovative circular economy-based solutions for EV, reducing the dependency on critical raw materials via the consistent recovery and use of secondary materials.
Scope: The objective will be to demonstrate the feasibility of circular economy (CE) and net- zero approaches for the EV value chain over its full lifetime (cradle to cradle). The proposed activities should focus on vehicle production (design, manufacturing and assembly), maintenance, repair and End-of-Life (EoL). Additionally, LCA-based vehicle concepts, their related resource and energy efficient manufacturing and CE consistent EoL strategies should be shown.

This includes a re-design of components for circularity.
?	Assessing the potential for high value and/or energy or rare material content components to be refurbished and reused in new vehicles or as spares.
?	Enhancing digital tools enabling a higher degree of circularity along the automotive value chain, e. g. supporting circular design and development, manufacturing or to track materials, their use and the EoL.
?	The impact of maintenance and repair technologies and operational strategies will be developed or adapted to ensure a higher degree of circularity compared to existing practices in the passenger car industry.
?	Deriving a concept for measuring and assessing the circularity of EV solutions as well as for ensuring a sufficient exchange of information along the automotive supply chain applying FAIR principles248.

?	Account for the contribution of the 2ZERO partnership and the results of its projects, towards its main goals (as measured against the whole set of the identified KPIs).
?	Support the identification and quantification of all interactions, impacts and effectiveness of the partnership within the road transport challenge, mainly as a result of the information gleaned from the 2ZERO partnership project results.
?	Provide additional recommendations for further development and analysis of means of measurement and evaluation of the partnership within the road transport challenge.
Scope: In order to properly monitor the contribution of the different funded projects to the achievements of the 2ZERO partnership objectives, a common framework for monitoring and assessment of the results needs to be agreed, ultimately allowing their comparison and a proper evaluation of their cumulative benefits at an EU level. Moreover, general objectives, such as a carbon-neutral road transport system by 2050, air quality, technology leadership, economic growth, European competitiveness, and circular economy aspects should be also addressed.

?	Assess and measure results related to the specific partnership KPIs, how they are predicted to vary (as a consequence of the project outcomes) between the period 2025 to 2035.
?	Exploit the capabilities and techniques generated through the development and delivery of digital twin representations and of the results of the 2ZERO funded projects.
?	Address at least the means of measuring all relevant parameters related to the 2ZERO KPIs: more generically, climate, air quality and circular economy aspects could also be quantitatively projected.

?	Allow a clear overview of the national projects and better take into account their results in the development of their research and deployment actions.
?	In order to facilitate the above-mentioned coordination of efforts at national and EU level and the sharing of best practices and results, data on national projects (to a level at least equivalent to those present in the CORDIS database) should be made available by MS and AC. The consortium will endeavour to promote and harmonise the registration of data on national projects of participating countries, to make data more accessible internationally and to facilitate their exchange and comparison. This will be supporting the integration of data on national projects into existing databases, such as TRIMIS and CORDIS.
?	Long lasting, strong coordination and cooperation between the European Commission, MS and AC and the Stakeholders involved in the 2ZERO Partnership, facilitated by the States Representatives Group (SRG).
Scope: Although there is a relatively large degree of similarity in the targets and approaches of the EU Member States and Associate Countries to address the climate change targets, still

considerable differences in the paths can be observed: more coordination and collaboration is urgently needed to promote zero emission road mobility, building on the policy cooperation network of the EU Member States/Associated countries built-up in ERA-NET Transport, Electromobility+ and ERA-NET Co-fund Electric Mobility Europe (EMEurope) with over two decades of experience.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects

?	Address zero-emission road mobility for people and goods programmes supporting all phases of the innovation: technology development, demonstration, deployment and implementation will be considered.
?	Develop a long-lasting network (beyond the project duration) of public and private stakeholders connecting EU Member States/Associated countries and European initiatives, under the umbrella of the 2ZERO partnership States Representative Group (also building on existing links with the supporting European technology platforms ALICE, ETIP-SNET, EPoSS, ERTRAC and Batteries Europe) to share knowledge, coordinate activities and bundling financial resources to achieve synchronicity, synergies and complementarity in the R&I-related plans, efforts, approaches, incentives and funding programmes to effectively support the EU and national objectives for 2030 and 2050.

?	Innovative ground-based refuelling and supply systems for liquid hydrogen at air transport ground infrastructures, with the potential to be up-scaled at system level by 2027.
?	Transformative aircraft-based hydrogen refuelling technologies, with emphasis on safety, standardisation and scalability to various types of aircraft concepts (including Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft (VTOL) and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV)).
?	Zero-emission hydrogen-powered aircraft ground movements, demonstrated and scalable across airports of different sizes, locations and capacities in Europe.
?	Comprehensive and validated liquid hydrogen demand models at air transport ground infrastructures in Europe and globally, towards a potential entry into service of hydrogen aircraft by 2035.
?	New standards and certification procedures for the roll-out of the new technologies and solutions at large scale, in EU Member States/Associated countries and on the TEN-T network.
Scope: Hydrogen-powered commercial aviation is today on a promising path towards climate neutrality by 2050, with European industry setting 2035 as an expected date of entry into

service of the first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft. While the Horizon Europe Clean Hydrogen partnership focuses on the production side (e.g. developing new fuel cells and hydrogen storage technologies), the Clean Aviation partnership addresses the integration and demonstration of disruptive technologies, including ones on hydrogen-powered aviation and subsequent aircraft architectures. However, there is currently a clear research and innovation gap for the phase in-between. Most notably, this gap relates to the demonstration of hydrogen refuelling and supply from air transport ground infrastructures to the aircraft, with follow-on demonstrations of ground-based aircraft movements (e.g. taxiing). In particular, hydrogen refuelling entails significant operational issues, safety risks and other barriers (e.g. scalability) at both air transport ground infrastructure and aircraft levels. This has the potential to create a bottleneck for Europe to proceed on the path to climate neutrality, lower emissions and reducing Europe?s dependency on oil and fossil fuels, which are clear objectives of the Versailles Declaration 253 and REPowerEU 254 . At the same time, demonstration pilots of hydrogen-powered aircraft ground movements need to start urgently, in order to be able to achieve full operations of hydrogen-powered airplanes in the EU by 2035.
In this context, building on good practices, studies and research projects (e.g. Horizon 2020 green airport projects, Horizon 2020 ENABLE-H2), as well as other policy initiatives (e.g. Fit for 55 and ReFuelEU Aviation), actions should address all of the following aspects:
?	Assessing and validating potential liquid hydrogen demand models at air transport ground infrastructures in Europe and globally, considering also multimodality issues at airports arising from the use of hydrogen in road and rail transport. The techno-economic assessment should also consider the energy supply side and be aligned with the targets, investments and regulatory aspects addressed by REPowerEU, ReFuelEU Aviation, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation and the Trans-European Networks for Transport and Energy (TEN-T and TEN-E).
?	Testing and demonstrating innovative and safe ground-based refuelling, storage and supply systems for liquid hydrogen at air transport ground infrastructures, going beyond the state-of-the-art and in view of future standardisation, with focus on airports and vertiports serving national, intra-European and/or regional routes. Consideration should also be made to the hydrogen production (including on-site), supply, materials performance, storage and refuelling systems, with the concurrent use other liquid fuels (e.g. kerosene and sustainable aviation fuels) and electricity at air transport ground infrastructures, in order to enable zero-emission airport operations along the entire value chain, from multimodal road/rail connections, to ground handling and aircraft ground movements.
?	Developing and demonstrating new aircraft-based hydrogen refuelling technologies, with emphasis on operational feasibility, safety, interoperability, standardisation, scalability and cost optimisation, to showcase a clear technical and business case. The

technologies should be compatible with various propulsion technologies and aircraft concepts (e.g. different types of commercial aircraft and architectures, including VTOL and UAV, as also addressed in the Horizon Europe Clean Aviation partnership.
?	Performing small-scale demonstration pilots of zero-emission hydrogen-powered aircraft ground movements, in one or two airports (e.g. taxi-in / taxi-out), in view of deploying the new technologies and solutions to various aircraft types and airports across Europe.
?	Initiating and developing new standards and certification procedures, for the new technologies and systems to be scalable and serve different types of aircraft and air transport ground infrastructures of various sizes, locations and capacities for both passenger and freight transport.
The EU?s Hydrogen Strategy prioritises renewable hydrogen (low-carbon hydrogen being considered a transitional technology) and should be taken into account to develop the proposals, considering, inter alia, how the hydrogen will be produced and supplied.
The topic aims to exploit synergies with the Horizon Europe Clean Aviation and Clean Hydrogen partnerships, for the roll-out of transformative aircraft liquid hydrogen propulsion technologies, with an eye towards future large-scale demonstrations and real-life airborne plane trials during the later phase of the Clean Aviation partnership. The retained proposals, should, during the implementation phase, regularly exchange information with the Technical Committee and the Governing Board of the Clean Aviation and Clean Hydrogen partnerships respectively (in-line with articles 65 and 80 of the COM(2021) 87).
For standardisation activities and in view of future certification of airports and vertiports and aircraft, including VTOL and UAV, the participation of EASA is deemed necessary to address airport and aircraft certification issues. The involvement of airports, vertiports and aircraft manufacturers in the project activities is required. Since regional and short haul aviation is likely the first segment to start the transition to hydrogen-based fuel technology, the involvement of regional and insular airports in the project will be an asset.
In line with the Union?s strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, the participation of airports and regulatory bodies outside of the European Union is encouraged.
Projects should collaborate with the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking on aspects that require integration of hydrogen and are expected to contribute and participate to the activities of the TRUST database and the hydrogen observatory",

Project results are expected to contribute to one of the following expected outcomes:
?	Deliver transformative aircraft energy storage, conversion and distribution technologies for hydrogen and electrified propulsion that exceed the state-of-the-art.
?	Deliver novel heat dissipation, thermal management and recuperation technologies for megawatt class, that exceed the state-of-the-art.
?	Deliver advanced simulation tools, validation methodologies and control approaches for an aircraft hydrogen and electrified powertrain of megawatt class.
Scope: The proposal is expected to develop further transformative technologies, at low TRL, that have potential to be reviewed and considered for further development and demonstration beyond 2027, towards contributing to aviation climate neutrality by 2050. Electrified aircraft propulsion is the use of electric motors to drive a subset or all of its propulsors. Hydrogen and electrified aircraft propulsion explicitly expands the scope to include hydrogen combustion propulsion.
Hydrogen as energy carrier and batteries as energy storage have the potential to eliminate aviation CO2 emissions as well as reduce non-CO2 ones. Key enabling technologies for aircraft thermal and power management have been identified as showstoppers for their integration.
The topic is open also to fundamental hydrogen research - relevant to aviation ? which can be combined to any of the three expected outcomes, such as:
?	better understanding of advanced materials? compatibility and capability in aircraft hydrogen and electrified powertrain applications including effect of water vapour from hydrogen burning;

?	computational materials science and innovative characterisation techniques across different length scales.
Beyond the development of transformative systems, the topic may consider the development of innovative control approaches as well as simulation tools and validation methodologies for hydrogen and electrified powertrain of a megawatt class. The development of dedicated test benches (at a TRL range within the scope of this call) should exploit synergies with the CA (cf. note).
The topic aims to exploit synergies with the Clean Aviation partnership, towards developing transformative aircraft hydrogen and electrified powertrain technologies, with an eye towards their review, selection and further development during the second phase of CA. The retained proposals, should, during the implementation phase, regularly exchange information with the Technical Committee and the Governing Board of the Clean Aviation and Clean Hydrogen partnerships respectively (in-line with articles 65 and 80 of the COM(2021) 87).
The topic is not open to hydrogen and electrified architectures, their integration and new aircraft configurations, as those are dealt exclusively in the Clean Aviation partnership (except aircraft types/missions not covered by the CA partnership). Activities should exploit synergies with the Clean Aviation (CA) partnership, with an eye towards their review, selection and further development during the second phase of CA.

Project results are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
?	Multi-disciplinary and multi-fidelity design and optimisation integrated tools for industrial environment.
?	New advancements in aerodynamics and aeroacoustics (with emphasis on interference), including data-driven (Artificial Intelligence ? Machine Learning, Hybrid modelling) high-performance computing and advanced validation-verification procedures.
?	Advance further design for manufacturing optimisations, including additive manufacturing, circularity and sustainability aspects.
?	Methodologies for simulation, testing and further certification of urban air-mobility safety critical applications, considering for example, virtual or extended reality technologies.
Scope: The proposal is expected to develop further advanced computational/experimental procedures/methodologies and industrial aircraft design capabilities that have potential to contribute to the digital transformation of the European aircraft supply chain.
Aircraft development requires testing for airframe, dynamic systems, materials performance, new manufacturing techniques, propulsion, cabin and system and their sub-components in order to ensure their performance but also the highest level of safety. As a result, the proposal is also expected to develop methodologies and approaches dedicated to the use of combined experimental testing with numerical simulation in order to enhance the testing results and their integration - and therefore accelerate the development cycle.
Regarding the expected outcome on urban air-mobility safety critical and hazardous missions, the scope is expanded to mission specific testing of the whole aerial vehicle after system integration.
The proposal should seek to exploit synergies with Clean Aviation (and big demonstrations in the second phase of the partnership) such as ground vibration testing, flutter mitigation, design of Ultra performant aircraft, advanced dynamic systems, hydrogen systems testing, thermal management, flight testing and long-term hydrogen exposed materials behaviour testing. The retained proposals, should, during the implementation phase, regularly exchange information with the Technical Committee of the Clean Aviation partnership (in-line with article 65 of the COM(2021) 87).

All developed hybrid numerical/experimental procedures and methodologies should be benchmarked (e.g. drag prediction, solver convergence, grid optimisation) for challenging industrial cases. Proposals that include virtual certification are encouraged to invite the participation of EASA.

?	Establish the basis for the on-board deployment of power conversion technologies for sustainable alternative climate neutral fuels by 2030;
?	Validate the technical feasibility of the use of innovative power conversion technologies for sustainable alternative carbon neutral fuels in waterborne transport;
?	Prove the scalability to power outputs significantly above 3 MW with acceptable power density and high efficiency; Validate achievement of the additional KPIs of; minimum 5 kW/m3 power density (refers to power density of the energy converter, i.e. excluding storage of fuel or liquid electrolytes); minimum 45 % total system energy efficiency including all required ancillaries with zero carbon or climate neutral operation weighted over the MARPOL Annex VI E2 or E3 cycle;
?	Support regulatory development within both EU and IMO frameworks;
?	Prove the safety of the proposed solutions through verifiable KPIs for the use of the fuel and power conversion system concerned;
?	Validate resilience of the power system to possible fuel impurities and variability of the power required by the ship;
?	Developed a realistic pathway to the wider use of power conversion system technologies in waterborne transport (e.g. Long Distance, Inland, Cruise, Ferries, Short Sea and Offshore);
?	Risk assessed the power conversion system with respect to lifetime, maintenance scheme and life cycle cost as well as a life cycle GHG emissions;
?	Where relevant, be coherent with the activities of the Batteries co-programmed partnership and the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking.
Scope: Sustainable climate neutral fuels with emissions considered on a full well to wake life cycle basis are expected to be essential to decarbonise deep sea, large scale and energy intensive shipping, with their associated high-power demands. A range of candidate fuels are advocated, including for example liquid and gaseous advanced biofuels and liquids, advanced synthetic renewable energy carriers, green hydrogen, green ammonia and green methanol. Whilst power conversion technologies for these fuels, include novel internal combustion engines and fuel cells are being addressed by ongoing R&I, whilst power outputs are slowly

increasing, in most cases, they remain well below that needed for a primary power source which is usable for commercial shipping and systems remain very sensitive to fuel impurities, whereas high purity fuel cannot always be assured for waterborne transport. Large uncertainties with respect to the operational and capital costs are also a barrier for innovative technologies being taken up in the market.
To be widely deployed, new power conversion technologies are expected to be technically and economically viable for integration on board ships. They have to be capable of delivering:
?	High powers for prolonged periods,
?	A power density which would be acceptable for integration within ship structures,
?	High efficiency, without increasing air pollutants.
Progress beyond the state of the art is required. To facilitate scalability, the developed power conversion technology should be robust to the typical fuel qualities expected within a waterborne transport environment as well as potential contaminations introduced when blending different fuels, while maintaining endurance and reliable power output with reduced air pollution. Power conversion technologies have to be also robust under variable power demand, experienced in typical seaways and ship manoeuvres.
The topic is open to all potentially sustainable climate neutral fuels and all energy conversion technologies, including but not limited to Internal Combustion Engines, Turbines and fuel cells.
Projects are expected to advance beyond the state of the art addressing all the following aspects,
?	Develop and validate, in a laboratory or relevant environment, power conversion technologies for sustainable alternative climate neutral fuels. Scope should include ship configuration, performance simulation and scenario comparisons to enable the use of one or more fuels onboard the ships;
?	Validate in a relevant environment resilience to fuel impurities accepted by the power system and to cope with the variable power demand;
?	Potential fuel blends and combinations should be considered as solutions to reach required power conversion performance, taking into account; any increase in total energy (or even decrease) output compared to current fuels, lowest possible levels of noise and air pollutant emissions (SOx, NOx, CO, PM, ammonia slip, nitrous oxides), and the lowest possible well-to-wake GHG emissions.
?	In addition, safety KPIs for the use of the fuel concerned, in particular when using green ammonia and methanol, should be developed and verified.
?	The projects should undertake a risk and predictive assessment of lifetime of the power conversion and fuel system, the life-cycle cost throughout vessel life, maintenance

scheme, as well as the life-cycle cost and GHG emissions on a well-to-wake assessment basis.
?	Develop a realistic pathway to the wider use of power conversion system technologies in waterborne transport
Where relevant, plan for synergies with the activities of the Batteries co-programmed partnership and the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-12, Demonstrations to accelerate the switch to safe use of new sustainable climate neutral fuels in waterborne transport (ZEWT Partnership),4/20/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,8.00 to 13.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Full scale on board operational demonstration of a sustainable climate-neutral fuel system, including fuel distribution, bunkering, fuels storage, power conversion and possible residue handling, in a realistic on-board operational environment;
?	Verifiable KPIs to prove the effectiveness, viability, and impact of the demonstrated solutions;

?	KPIs to be demonstrated include: ship power optimisation; bunkering specificity (equipment, safety, operations, flowrate); energy consumption efficiency in waterborne transport; reduction of the global emission of GHGs; life-cycle GHG emissions on a well-to-wake assessment basis and reduction of the air pollution emissions (SOx, NOx, CO, PM) in a range of operating scenarios.
?	Accelerated transition to climate-neutral or zero-emission maritime and inland ship operations, by facilitating the wider adoption of sustainable climate neutral fuels at a larger scale and for vessels requiring prolonged autonomy. Particularly focusing on fuels where significant on-board challenges remain, with consideration of the specific supply chain requirements to satisfy the needs of maritime transport and inland navigation, in particular shipping activities with frequent cargo handling operations.
?	Demonstrated possibilities from smart digitalisation, to facilitate the on-board use of sustainable climate neutral waterborne fuels.
?	Demonstrate achievement of the 2040 targets specified within the European Commission proposal for a Fuel EU Maritime regulation reference COM/2021/562.
Scope: Whilst smaller scale demonstration of vessels running on potentially sustainable climate neutral fuels have been ongoing in the waterborne transport sector256, large-scale demonstrations, particularly with more challenging fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia for which end-to-end transnational operations, safety, environmental effects, risks and their mitigation are still lacking. The assessment of the results from such large-scale demonstrators are necessary to trigger the wider adoption of sustainable climate neutral fuels within waterborne transport sector.
Adoption of sustainable climate neutral fuels within waterborne transport assets will in turn be possible only if the outstanding challenges of the daily operations are solved, for example bunkering, storage, handling and on-board operations have to be proven safe. Sustainable climate neutral fuels include potential new safety issues, such as toxicity, different flashpoints or fire hazards which are expected to be addressed.
Operational performance and efficiency of the overall system in full operations have to be demonstrated, especially with respect to air pollution (NOx, SOx, PM, methane or ammonia slip, etc.) and well to wake GHG emissions. The systems, processes and components needed to handle and use sustainable climate neutral fuels will also be demonstrated. Continuous emission and performance monitoring systems and their integration are an additional challenge that should be taken into consideration, including monitoring of emission profiles and identifying operating patterns that require optimisation as well as the identification and management of potential trade-offs.



256	Waterborne transport concerns both maritime shipping and inland waterway transport, explanation of the segments is included in the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the ZEWT co- programmed partnership.

Smart digitalisation also provides new opportunities to facilitate the efficient, clean and safe use of climate neutral sustainable fuels, for example by enabling advanced engine emission management.
Activities will also underpin the pre-normative R&I required to facilitate the routine deployment of Sustainable Alternative Fuels (SAFs).
Demonstration within operational conditions is targeted. The challenge is to increase confidence in, and acceptability of, the viability of sustainable climate neutral fuels where full operational demonstration has yet to be achieved, including for example green hydrogen, green ammonia, green methanol sustainable liquid and gaseous advanced biofuels and other advanced intermediate bioenergy and synthetic renewable energy carriers, together with their associated power systems.
Projects are expected to address all of the following aspects either for a) inland waterway transport or b) maritime transport applications:
?	Develop, validate and demonstrate a sustainable climate-neutral fuels system on board, in full transnational operations including fuel distribution, bunkering, fuel storage, power conversion and possible residue handling. A minimal power of 1MW (for either full or partial vessel power), addressing significant challenges and going beyond state-of-the-art as well as demonstrating achievement of FuelEU Maritime 2040 targets is required. Demonstrating higher powers which will be applicable to a wider range of applications is encouraged. Due to the scale of resources required, for option a) inland waterway transport- demonstration is expected to be undertaken on more than one vessel type, for option b) maritime transport- it is optional to demonstrate more than one vessel. Use of replacement renewable low carbon fuels in otherwise conventional oil/gas-based energy conversion technology should not be considered.
?	Demonstrate applicability of sustainable climate neutral fuels in particular considering stricter environmental expectations and regulations, such as those applicable to passenger ships, inland waterway transport and other environmentally sensitive regions.
?	Provide validated risk and safety assessments, mitigation measures and demonstration supporting the development of safety provisions in regulation proposals both in EU and potentially at IMO, ISO and inland waterway regulatory frameworks and taking into account operational conditions such as cargo handling activities.
?	Demonstrate the capacity of innovative smart digitalisation to facilitate the safe, clean and efficient on-board use of sustainable climate neutral fuels.
?	Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business

plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (such as the Innovation Fund).
?	Proposals should plan and propose relevant synergies with relevant Horizon Europe activities such as the Clean Oceans Mission, the Batteries co-programmed partnership and the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking results and activities arising from projects under topics HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-07 or HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01-14.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-13, Integrated real-time digital solutions to optimise navigation and port calls to reduce emissions from shipping (ZEWT Partnership),4/20/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 7.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Progressing beyond the state of the art, full-scale demonstration of an interoperable port call and voyage optimisation tool on existing routes and services involving at least three ports and two shipping companies and relevant stakeholders in port call operations.
?	Improved operational efficiency of vessels when arriving to/departing from ports, towards elimination of waiting times during navigation and at the port. Develop and demonstrate in realistic environment, KPIS?s to quantify these gains.
?	Increased navigational safety through improved sea traffic management from onshore which has been assessed with respect to the status quo considering also situational awareness during port entrance, manoeuvring, berthing, departure and potentially related skills issues.
?	Optimised fuel efficiency and reduced vessel emissions through voyage, waiting at anchorage and port arrival optimisation to facilitate more efficient sailing speeds. Reductions in fuel consumption of 10 to 20% with corresponding reductions in greenhouse gas emission should be demonstrated, compared to business as usual during navigation and at port and port-to-port approach.
?	Enable shipping companies to quantify their fuel savings and the GHG emissions avoided as a result of the optimisation system and the real-time information shared with ports during vessel voyage.
?	Development of port call optimisation standards considering the on-going standardisation initiatives by IMO/ISO groups to facilitate a secure and resilient operational, real-time digital data sharing and decision support system for port and voyage optimisation; and develop operational roadmap(s) for standard technical committees.
?	Assessment and quantification of the benefits of port and navigation optimisation for different types of maritime traffic, e.g. tramp and regular services for bulk, container, passenger, cruise ships, Ro-Pax, Ro-Ro, etc.
?	Adaption to the existing and/or development of business models to prove the commercial viability of voyage and port call optimisation to facilitate take up and its wider application.
Scope: Shipping is frequently subject to prolonged waiting periods offshore before birthing and offloading cargo. Vessels waiting at anchorage pending the availability of port capacity

reduce operational efficiency as well as increasing emissions, either whilst waiting or due to faster sailing speeds to arrive at port in case of birth availability. To avoid these situations, port call optimisation systems have been developed and are now being piloted. However, these have been generally limited to specific services. More widely applicable navigation and port call optimisation tools which can address the entire voyage, promote the most efficient sailing speeds to reduce emissions and ensure direct berthing without delay could substantially improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions.
Activities should take a holistic approach to the development and scale up of an integrated port scheduling and voyage optimisation tool to address real multi vessel traffic scenarios, focussing on vessel routing and voyage optimisation, minimising emissions and the eventual port call process, going beyond existing systems and combining the perspectives of both shipping and port operators.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Develop collaborative harmonized collaborative standards and communication amongst relevant stakeholders to enable an interoperable optimisation system to be deployed across the operations of the stakeholders concerned. Thereby facilitate the real time sharing of operational digital data, supporting enhanced situational awareness and decision support to reduce emissions through lower total voyage fuel consumption. For example, the following functions may be included; cargo handling, port services, clearance, commercial services such as bunkering, onshore power connection, berth availability, terminal capacity, weather, sailing speed, voyage data etc. Standards should address security, resilience as well as potential integration within existing port infrastructures and their monitoring systems.
?	Develop methodologies and tools to enable information sharing and optimisation of routes and time of arrival in real time, including decision algorithms that use methods such as AI, Edge Analytics, heuristics, and business analytics.
?	Using existing routes and services, progressing beyond the state of the art, demonstrate the operation at full-scale of an interoperable port call and voyage optimisation tool towards at least three ports and two shipping companies in addition other stakeholders linked to port call operation.
?	Consider system security as well as resilience and mitigation actions in case of failure.
?	Carry out risk assessment for the developed solutions, using existing models (such as FSA, HAZOP, etc.) to support safety and business continuity in case of failure as well as regulatory development at IMO and EU level.
?	Address the full voyage, including vessel positions far from port, to maximise emission reduction and operational efficiency benefits. Data sources should include among others weather, consumption, emission, traffic and port planning.

?	Build upon existing systems, technologies and regulations (for instance, European Maritime Single Window and other national undertakings) to ensure direct applicability with existing requirements. Other innovative and new technologies can also be deployed.
?	Develop and measure KPIs for efficiency from real cases, including calculation of the gains from the application of the solutions developed within the project. Measure the resulting reduction in emissions achieved as a result of the voyage and port scheduling optimisation system compared to a typical similar non-optimized service.
?	Plans for the exploitation and dissemination should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used
Participation of end users in proposals is necessary. Commitment from end users towards the deployment of solutions developed in the project will be considered positively. All proposals will need to demonstrate a clear and credible pipeline from development to the operational deployment of the solution following the projects end.

?	In close cooperation with ship owners, operators and ports, demonstration and testing of an innovative solution to provide auxiliary power and possibly battery charging for ships moored and anchored at sea which will cut pollution and GHG?s and which can be deployable before 2030;
?	Developing guidelines on technical, operational and safety aspects for the provision of offshore power supply services;
?	Assessing the GHG and polluting emission savings from ships moored or at anchor through verifiable KPIs;
?	Assessment of the CAPEX and OPEX of the developed solution and optimisation of the concept to increase the financial viability of the developed solution.
Scope: The provision of electric energy to vessels at port is a mature technology which provides important benefits in terms of reducing the emissions from the waterborne transport sector, not only for CO2 but also for other pollutants. Within Europe this is particularly important as many ports are either an integral part of densely populated cities or very close to them. The provision of onshore power supply (OPS) to vessels in European ports forms an integral part of the ?Fit for 55? initiative. Due to direct electrification being more efficient, OPS is an important long-term solution applying to vessels with other clean technology solutions which will become more widely available. So far, the provision of OPS has been designed and applied for vessels securely berthed at terminals. This is an important step, which needs to be encouraged. However, in many cases, vessels need to spend important time at port anchorage, before a berth at a terminal is available. Some vessels such as cruise ship may also disembark their passengers to tenders offshore. During this period, vessels are using their main or auxiliary engines, thus creating emissions which impact port cities and coastal areas as well. A solution needs to be developed which can provide OPS to these vessels whilst not at berth. Current consideration of such applications has been mainly limited to barge mounted solutions and concept development of offshore cabled power buoys (e.g. floating power plants, LNG HIVE2, OPS barges and offshore charging buoys). Generally, solutions are not yet mature and, in several cases, use fossil fuels. Consequently, a range of other possibilities may remain. The solutions to be developed and demonstrated by the projects are expected to address all the following aspects:
?	The project should develop and test potential solutions for the provision of electric power to maritime vessels (primarily container ships and passenger vessels, including cruise ships) of at least 5000 GT.

?	Be adaptable, so that as required, power can be provided to different locations within the port anchorage.
?	Develop and demonstrate a solution which is flexible in terms of area of application i.e., that can be deployed in other areas within a port or possibly be moved to other ports, including if relevant, both inland and seaports.
?	Be based on direct electrification from shore grid connections or offshore renewable power or the use of sustainable alternative fuels including for example liquid and gaseous advanced biofuels, synthetic renewable energy carriers or energies.
?	Aim to minimize air pollution, including when solutions are founded upon biofuels.
?	If applicable, assess the possible use of circular energy sources such as those from industrial processes taking place within the port perimeter (chemical processing, scrap processing, melting etc.).
?	Aim for operational deployment by 2030. Minimize costs taking into account Capex and Opex with consideration of the energy conversion efficiency, the cost and availability of the supplied sustainable alternative fuels and/or energies.
?	Pay particular attention to all safety aspects relating to the provision of clean energy, while a vessel is at anchorage.
?	Evaluate the range of applicable regulatory instruments by reaching out to relevant Authorities.
?	For example, the proposed solution maybe founded upon one of the following concepts, although other concepts may also be proposed:
?	Barge mounted generators, using sustainable low GHG fuels.
?	Floating energy storage units, using batteries together with inverters and a capability to provide the typical total energy need of a ship at a port anchorage.
?	Barge mounted fuel cells using green hydrogen fuel or other climate neutral sustainable alternate fuel.
?	Cabled offshore power supply connections towards buoys or other supply interface.
?	Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used.

In addition, the IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) for all cargo, RoPax and cruise vessels above 5,000 GT and trading internationally will come into effect in 2023. To ensure that ships at the end of their operational lives can be recycled and do not pose any unnecessary risks to human health, safety and harm to the environment, the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships was introduced in 2009. Furthermore the 2013 EU ship recycling regulation sets higher standards and requires that from 2019 ships have to be recycled within an approved facility. Furthermore, Green Passport and Green Passport EU may be assigned to ships by class societies which include an Inventory of on board Hazardous Materials (IHM).
Assessment of a ships full environmental value chain misses in particular:

?	Sufficient data or industry standards to describe the characteristics of a ships non- hazardous materials which may contribute additional value from recovery, recycling and re-use. For example, in line with ""circular economy"" principals, a cradle-to-cradle material passport which is analogous to that applied within the building industry is missing.

?	Key performance indicators (KPI?s) addressing the environmental impact shipyard pollution to air, water and earth caused by shipbuilding, ship maintenance, repair, retrofit and dismantling. High performance and clean production processes.
?	The contribution from the shipyards towards ship design and the application of non- hazardous recyclable materials beyond the current IHM-passport.
?	Guidance concerning best practices to minimise the non-operational environmental impacts from shipping considering construction, materials, capacity to repair, design and capacity for recycling. For example, including difficult materials such as plastic composites.
Activities will address the greening of shipyards, facilitating clean, efficient, low-energy processes which minimise pollution to air, water and earth and contribute to increasing ship circularity.
Proposals should address all of the following points:

?	Develop and validate an environmental performance index with corresponding KPI?s and determine a benchmark for shipyards through an investigation of shipyard floor processes, logistics and utilities i.e., energy use and emissions to air, water and earth, taking into account current environmental regulations, including those applicable to other land-based industries which may apply to shipyards.
?	Identify the contribution of shipyards and ship design to the circular life cycle of ships in terms of reuse of components and materials within the context of shipyard processes, the shipbuilding value chain, capacity for repair and refit, end of life circularity and disposal value/cost. Considering also difficult materials such as reinforced plastics.
?	Develop and validate a digital shipyard model encompassing shipyard floor technologies and logistic processes with the associated energy use and emissions, links to safety (e.g., ventilation to reduce indoor VOC?s increasing energy consumption), enabling the assessment and benchmarking of the environmental performance of shipyards and the impact of ?clean floor? technologies on shipyards.
?	Develop and validate in line with the ?Green Passport? a material circularity passport for maritime assets and identify the role of the manufacturing and design value chain stakeholders to apply best practices to increase circularity, reduce life cycle impacts and optimise end of life value. Foresee the compilation and maintenance of the passport over the ship lifecycle.
?	Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scaling up application, wider commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan), if necessary indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-16," Developing small, flexible, zero-emission and automated vessels to support shifting cargo from road to sustainable Waterborne Transport",4/20/2023,RIA,12/23/2022,,,Around 4.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Development and validation of a small zero-emission automated vessel concept which can support shifting cargo from road to water. The concept will take into account cargo types and navigation conditions (e.g. small waterways, bridges, locks and shallow coastal waters and estuaries).
?	Quantification and assessment of the reduced costs and emissions and stronger intra- and intermodal competitiveness of waterborne transport through integration of zero emission propulsion of automated vessels and transhipment into automated transport chains, internet of things and possibly urban logistics.
?	Development of business models that benefit from a high degree of automation digitalisation, considering technical, safety, security and organisational aspects and when relevant smart on demand services.
Scope: Waterborne transport can transfer large freight volumes from road and as a result reduce emissions and decongest road infrastructure. There are large opportunities to increase waterborne freight, especially in coastal and inland or congested urban regions. This potential is particularly underdeveloped within smaller waterways, lakes, estuaries and intra urban regions and with the use of less developed ports which are not accessible for larger vessels.

Whilst projects addressing coastal transport and metropolitan inland waterway transport, including new autonomous waterborne feeder loop logistic services are underway, these remain at an early stage or are tailored to specific use cases which cannot be widely deployed.
Emerging energy efficient, zero-emission and automation technology can help fully exploit the potential of small-sized waterborne transport but are expected to be adopted to the needs of such vessels and the related additional transhipment.
Lower costs are needed for small waterborne transport to become more competitive with road transport.
Flexible, fully automated transport chain is expected to facilitate waterborne services to new and previously poorly accessible regions.
Shallow water depths of smaller waterways with confined conditions require a broad variety of intelligent vessel solutions, which are tailored to the regional requirements, the specifics of individual cargo types and load units, e.g., ISO containers, swap-bodies, unitized and palletized goods for urban transports etc.
Decarbonisation of propulsion systems is needed to address the challenges of climate change. Automated solutions need to also take into account unexpected recreational users of the waterways.
Research should develop versatile zero emission solutions for small, shallow water capable automated vessels that are also usable on different classes of waterway and/or coastal waters.
Developments should advance beyond the state of the art taking into account current and emerging developments concerning low-water designs, modular vessels, automation, digital communication and security battery electrification, charging, and propulsion systems.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Development, testing and demonstration of the automated flexible vessel concepts with emission-free propulsion systems in a relevant environment. In addition, the optimisation of the logistics chain will be assessed through logistics modelling.
?	Innovative automation approaches for substantial cost savings.
?	Tailored propulsion arrangements for small, flexible and versatile vessels which are compatible with shallow water.
?	Automated operations in multimodal logistics should be envisaged through further development and integration of single automated functions into fully autonomous systems such as; navigation and vessel command, machinery surveillance, maintenance, berthing, cargo handling, transhipment etc.
?	Self-organised or remotely controlled fleet-wide coordination of operations, along with an integration of the vessels into land-based digital logistics processes.

?	The development of new business models including a high degree of digitalisation and smart on-demand services. Consideration of key stakeholder behaviours, including retailers? and customers.
?	Ensuring safety, cyber security and resilience of automations systems.
?	Early communication and discussion with relevant regulatory and standardisation bodies",

?	Working together with the Waterborne Technology Platform and the inland waterway transport sector; strengthen the coordination between national, EU and industrial research across the waterborne transport sector, the wider logistics chain in cooperation with relevant international organisations so as to increase the deployment of the solutions developed and provide input towards EU R&I and deployment programmes.
?	With the direct involvement of end users? improvement of the environmental performance of inland waterways and contribute to future-proof; workforce, infrastructure, digital and automation developments which are compatible with a changing climate.
Scope: The European Green Deal and NAIADES III challenges require a breakthrough Action Plan for the innovative system change from a holistic perspective to achieve drastic emission reduction and modal shift targets. These elements lead to:
?	a change in the ownership structure and business models (e.g. energy as a service, leasing),
?	intensive horizontal and vertical collaboration, vessels using (near) zero-emission technologies and energy carriers (e.g. batteries, fuel cell, synthetic fuels and clean combustion),
?	standardised and modular hardware and ship design as well as advanced IT solutions for connected inland waterways transport,
?	synchro-modal planning,
?	safe and autonomous navigation and smart shipping.
Also, the required infrastructure, regulations, incentives need to be addressed. Finally, end user buy-in and commitment will be key to facilitate these changes.
Targeted follow up coordination and support activities are needed in the Inland Waterways sector and in particular to support implementation of NAIADES III. These actions will

address greening, and digitalisation and the leverage of the outcomes from related projects. In addition, actions should support a bridge between research, innovation and the buy in and deployment within inland waterways sector in coordination with the wider waterborne and logistics sectors.
A dedicated Coordination and Support Action will act as European platform and catalyst by bringing together the required expertise, disciplines and stakeholders. Synergies and collaboration with other sectors and transport modes will be crucial elements.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Identification and analysis of barriers and opportunities for the development, implementation and take up of low and zero-emission innovations as well as digital solutions for the inland waterway transport sector in close cooperation with relevant projects and initiatives, including those targeting the broader waterborne transport sector. In this respect, a particular focus will be to decarbonise and improve the environmental performance of inland waterway transport, particularly within urban and protected areas as well as future-proofing infrastructure and ensuring compatibility with digital and automation developments within a changing climate.
?	Development of an implementation plan, in close cooperation with the industry, which includes an assessment of the Total Cost of Ownership. Lessons learnt from frontrunners will be included in the assessment. In addition, the industrial commitment in terms of investments will need to be leveraged with additional resources, which might be available in the next Multiannual Financial Framework, aiming for a dedicated financial instrument for co-financing the deployment of zero-emission, automated vessels with innovative public-private collaboration models for deployment258.
?	The development and validation of a Digital Twin to support conclusions and recommendations on policy measures and regulations. The Digital Twin enables quantitatively simulating different scenarios and options to assess the contributions on modal share by the NAIADES III measures and emission reductions and the impacts for the various stakeholders involved.
?	The consolidation of the Inland Waterways Transport (IWT) knowledge network, which was previously established with the support of H2020 and will end in 2023. The coordination and support action will build on the results of previous work and will reflect the multi-disciplinary requirements and complexity of the subject, coordinating with the wider waterborne, land transport and logistics communities. It will identify the appropriate measures and define the necessary means and tools.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D5-01-18, Advanced transport emissions monitoring networks,4/20/2023,IA,12/23/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
Supporting the Zero Pollution Action Plan and its monitoring strategy by:

?	Monitoring pollutant (including both exhaust and non-exhaust traffic related particles259) and noise emissions of road vehicles on specific sites in urban areas with high density

259	Like the brake and tyre wear emissions which are generated from non-exhaust traffic related sources such as brake, tyre, clutch and road surface wear.

traffic in order to feed multiple real time systems and databases for air quality and environmental noise monitoring, anti-tampering enforcement, market surveillance and policy support at local, national and EU level.
?	Monitoring pollutant (including both exhaust and non-exhaust traffic related particles) and noise emissions around ports, rail stations or junctions, dry ports, and airports, allowing for instance to monitor and enforce the respect of fuel use mandates in specific protection areas, correct noise abatement procedures, aircraft type limitations, etc.
?	Establishing real time maps and networks in at least eight cities with at least three traffic air quality and noise stations on each city ( a minimum of 5 stations in ports and 5 stations in airports is required) capable of measuring noise and solid particle number (PN) and other emerging pollutants and GHGs in addition to the currently regulated ones and the impact of nature-based solutions (such as line trees along the streets, green facades in buildings, urban parks etc.) for mitigating them.
?	Supporting local, regional and national emissions and noise reduction plans (including dynamic ones based on smart traffic management systems, capable of influencing the behaviour of drivers and automated vehicles) by providing supporting real time data and integrating the impact of road, rail, port and airport traffic into the management strategy.
?	Supporting health studies about the impact of ultrafine particles according to recent WHO guidance
?	Stimulate citizen awareness and engagement in the Zero Pollution strategy (also through citizen science approach)
?	Providing recommendations concerning the use of nature-based solutions for mitigating urban air and noise pollution and contribute to the standardisation effort of sensing/monitoring technologies.
Scope: Transport emissions are a known cause of air and noise pollution in Europe, and therefore negative health impacts, particularly in urban environments. Road emissions play a significant part, but there can be important contributions by other transport sources if airports, ports, or rail stations with significant traffic from diesel locomotives are within or close to the city boundaries. Moreover, construction machinery can largely contribute to both emissions and noise where large building sites are present.
Long-term exposure to air pollutants from road traffic, railways and aircrafts can lead to serious health effects, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular diseases, annoyance, cognitive impairment and mental health problems. Noise pollution has its share of causing those health impacts and is an equally important environmental concern, likewise emitted by means of transport (road, rail, air traffic) and from sites of industrial activity. Besides the combustion engine, it can also be caused by aerodynamics or tyre-road or wheel-rail interactions. It adversely affects quality of life and well-being, prompting the need for seeking

solutions to tackle these two forms of environmental pollution in order to reduce their harmful effects on human health and on the natural environment.
While some of these emissions are regulated, it has become apparent that the performance of propulsion and after treatment systems can change depending on use conditions or over time due to different causes (poor or even fraudulent design, tampering by the user, poor maintenance, catalyst degradation ?). Therefore, there is more and more interest to monitor these particle and noise emissions to the level of the individual vehicle and their cumulative effect at the city scale in order to provide a sound basis to understand the causes and to tackle, if needed, higher-than-expected emissions by enforcement or regulatory means.
Traffic related particles can be distinguished into exhaust traffic related particles, which are emitted as a result of incomplete fuel combustion and lubricant volatilisation during the combustion procedure, and non-exhaust traffic related particles, which are either generated from non-exhaust traffic related sources such as brake, tyre, clutch and road surface wear or already exist in the environment as deposited material and become re-suspended due to traffic induced turbulence. It is estimated that exhaust and non-exhaust sources contribute significantly to total traffic related PM10 emissions, thus it is important to monitor both these categories of pollutant emissions.
The Flagship on the contribution of transport to pollution in the 2019 call has included several topics addressing the development of technologies to monitor some of these emissions, and it is now important to transfer these technologies to the field and to integrate them in networks capable of 24/7 unassisted operation and data management and reporting for enforcement and fleet monitoring by cities and national bodies, and where appropriate shared with EU level bodies.
The design, testing and demonstration of these applications will be developed in cooperation with the involved cities, citizen associations, and authorities, to achieve the best use of monitoring data. Citizen science approach could be appropriate for these activities.
Projects are expected to install monitoring stations around at least 5 ports and 5 airports, allowing for instance to monitor and enforce the respect of fuel use mandates, correct noise abatement procedures, aircraft type limitations, etc. Projects should achieve synergies between the monitored cities, ports and airports.
At the same time, recent WHO guidance 260 recognised the specific risks posed by nanoparticles and provided for the first time a quantification of what can be considered a low and a high concentration of particles in terms of numbers instead of mass. Guidance was also provided to widen the collection of data to ultrafine particles down to at least 10nm, in order to allow the performance of epidemiological studies and, in the longer term, the establishment of new limit values.
Moreover, emerging pollutants and greenhouse gases are increasing due to the deployment of new technologies. Nitrous oxide, for instance, is both a very potent GHG and a neurotoxic

260	https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/345329

with negative effects also on liver and kidneys and is a by-product of several catalysts. Ammonia is also posing similar by-product issues, in particular for methane and SCR- equipped vehicles, by leading to high secondary particulate levels. Therefore, monitoring these and other chemicals and their synergistic effects is becoming more and more important to inform policy decisions and provide data for modelling and emissions inventories.
A specific topic in the 2020 Green Deal call261 foresaw the developments of measurement instruments and methodologies for ambient ultrafine particles and atmospheric particulate matter, their sizes, constituents, source contributions and gaseous precursors. The wider deployment of the results on a cross-European base, encompassing as many as possible different locations in terms of urban morphology and meteorological and pollution conditions is paramount for the validation of the system and for the establishment of an EU-wide network.
Establishing, or contributing to, national level databases of traffic related emissions could support population-based health studies about the impact of these emissions to human health. These databases could, for example, contain detailed information on traffic density, modal split, current composition of the respective road traffic fleet, especially in urban areas, and all health relevant pollutants, such as particles (PM10, PM2.5, UFP), NOx, benzene and EC/BC.
In consideration of the above, proposals should address all the aforementioned aspects and issues in order to achieve the expected outcomes",

?	Reinforced cooperation between the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (US) in the field of transport research and innovation.
?	EU-US Transport Research Symposia organisation with high visibility, political and strategic relevance of the transport sector and of the EU policy in the field.
?	More effective links and exchanges between research and innovation stakeholders and policy makers from the EU and the US.
Scope: The EU and the US are both world leaders in transport research. On both sides, there is an increasing willingness to enhance and extend EU-US cooperation in the area of transport research.
An Implementing Arrangement between the European Commission and the US DoT was signed in 2013 for cooperative activities in the field of research, development, technology and innovation applied to all modes of transport. The purpose of this arrangement is to advance the EU and US cooperation and collaboration in R&I for all the four modes of transport, including multi-modal activities. To implement that agreement, a Steering Group has been established, composed of DG MOVE and RTD officials for the EU side, to identify, elaborate and coordinate collaborative activities.
Within this context, EU-US Transport Research Symposia are to be co-organised on one side by the European Commission and on the US side, by the US DoT and the Transportation Research Board (TRB) on a yearly basis. Hosting of the Symposia?s organisation is done on alternate years by the EC and the US.

The symposia promote common understanding, sharing of experience and best practices, efficiencies, and transatlantic cooperation within the international transportation research community, while accelerating transport-sector innovations in EU Member States/Associated countries and the United States.
Six symposia already took place in the last years addressing themes such as: ?Urban City Logistics? (Washington, 2013), ?Transport Research Implementation? (Paris, 2014), ?Automated Road Vehicles? (Washington, 2015), 'Infrastructure Resilience' (Brussels 2016), 'Decarbonizing transport for a sustainable future: mitigating climate change' (Washington, 2017), ' Socio-economic Impacts of Automated and Connected Vehicles' (Brussels, June 2018).
The aim of this action is to support the European Commission in organising the future annual symposia in 2024 (Brussels), in 2025 (Washington), in 2026 (Brussels) and in 2027 (Washington). Symposia are closed events with 50 experts -25 from the US and 25 from the EU- selected by US DoT and the European Commission respectively. Throughout the 3-day event, these experts are brought together to identify, discuss and elaborate strategic R&I recommendations related to the jointly chosen theme of each symposium by the US DoT and the European Commission.
The action will have to foresee the involvement of and collaboration with all the relevant European actors ? researchers, industry, users, innovation leaders, etc. - representing the transport sector, in collaboration with the European Commission services in the relevant Directorate Generals. Consultation of key transport players in Europe including the different European Technology Platforms in transport and relevant Horizon Europe partnerships is foreseen, depending on the theme selected for the future symposia.
The action will have to work together with the two EC services to define the overall planning of each symposium, to support the drafting of a White Paper and conference proceedings reports, to design the structure the sessions of the event, to manage the expert?s contributions (25 EU experts, 3 of them being part of a planning committee with their US counterparts) and cover the travel and subsistence of the EU experts, communication material, etc. For those years when the Symposia is held in Brussels, to also manage the overall organisation of the symposia including selecting the appropriate location for the venue, covering the costs for the venue, the logistics, the travels and subsistence for the EU experts, communication material etc.
The list of the European experts that will be invited to the symposia will be proposed by the project after consultation with the stakeholders and will be finalised by the Commission.
The outcome of these symposia will help define a common vision for future transportation and lay the foundation for activities of mutual interest and benefit in all modes of transport",

?	Development and demonstration of innovative, interoperable, efficient, low-power smart and bi-directional on-street charging, removing barriers to EV user acceptability in densely populated areas. User acceptability should be quantifiably improved from technological, investment costs and costs of charging point of view.
?	The proposed innovative solutions should be conductive to optimise efficiency and reduce costs, but ideally should not be visually and physically intrusive, or these aspects should be kept to a minimum level, given the high level of expected deployment that would create problems for pedestrians and other road users.
?	Development of an analytical methodology including representative models (replicable at an EU-wide scale) to ensure an efficient planning for the mass deployment and integration of public (and where applicable private) EV charging infrastructure 265 , satisfying concrete user needs (in particular for night charging of L, M1 and N1 vehicles and their opportunistic day charging) and making it compatible as much as possible with existing low voltage grid and power system capabilities.
?	Quantifiable improvement of related business models and gaps for users compared to current State of the Art, additionally also including considerations for less densely populated areas.



265	Considering, where appropriate, deployment targets under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) and Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) proposals

?	Development of socio-cultural databases at city, regional and national level comprising daily charging habits, practices, and ideas of different community clusters (including individuals with special needs) and their integration into charging and planning tools, to support the determination of the most efficient and most accepted charging solutions. These developments should interact with the work of Sustainable Transport Forum266.
?	The identification and analysis of potential regulatory aspects and barriers for relevant standardisation activities via common, interoperable and open standards, protocols and digital services.
?		Deployment of multilevel systemic architecture and solutions for smart and bi- directional charging power management that will increase RES penetration as well as enhance the grid capacities and power system resilience by alleviating grid congestions and levelling off the load curve.
Scope: Future charging infrastructure deployment should be ubiquitous, and should parallel, with a certain level of anticipation the growth of EV sales. Associated charging solutions should enable seamless processes that are easy, fully interoperable across European country borders and available at any time. The aim of this topic is to enable and improve massive smart on-street low-cost charging of EVs as well as improving the overall efficiency of power supply to the grid, including a space-and-time-oriented prediction and control of the global charging power demand, also enabling and improving smart home and office charging that could be explored by proposals to complement the on-street charging solutions.
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:

?	Guarantee an exhaustive coverage of high-efficiency, low-power, low-cost on-street smart charging points considering grid infrastructure and capacity, optimisation of civil works and grid requirements for services and charging needs, including the parking patterns (charging on long- and short-term parking spaces) to reduce the need for additional buffers to stabilise the grid.
?	Address users? needs and requirements in socio-cultural contexts of different communities to incorporate daily habits, practices and ideas into the design and development of people-friendly infrastructure with emphasis on public charging.
?	Use statistical models of parking, traffic and grid configuration and energy flows to predict and support power supply planning on a larger scale (e.g. at least regional), along with methodologies and demonstrations to derive or calibrate such models on the basis of real traffic and behavioural data.
?	People centric applications equipped with the analytical capability and Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for friendly access and use, that support the interactions related to the ratio between location, power (and its guaranteed minimum) and price for prompt

?	Support and demonstration of smart and bi-directional operation in overnight publicly accessible environments to accommodate demand for long-term charging, and meeting some of the requirements of opportunistic charging types, motivating the people to optimally charge (maximising the use of renewable power) and promoting the development and use of interfaces with customized vehicle charging technology which can be preconditioned and set-up by the driver, including the pre-allocation of charging points.
?	Development of innovative optimisation functions exploiting real-time access to battery information such as state of health, state of charge, capacity and power set point, which should be provided respecting any GDPR and data disclosure terms to the owners, users or other stakeholders in the value chain, such as building energy system managers, mobility and logistics service providers and electricity stakeholders.
?	The developed solutions are expected to be provided on non-discriminatory terms between users and classes of users and allow the choice of the e-mobility service providers, so as to avoid consumers lock-in with a single e-mobility service provider, affiliated to specific vehicle manufacturers.
?	Optimise the use of energy resources and infrastructures to cater not just for private mobility usage but also integrating opportunity use of the same infrastructure by other light duty captive fleets if their needs are compatible with the low power level.
This topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Furthermore, in order to achieve the expected outcomes, social innovation should be considered.

A holistic approach to the whole powertrain should contribute to determining the optimal next generation voltage level. Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Very fast charging, ultra-efficient electric vehicles (EVs) for broad mass markets, taking into account volume effects and cost optimized architectures for future markets.
?	A cost reduction of a minimum of 20% of power electronic modules and inverters for a given power, as well as for the whole powertrain, should be demonstrated (in comparison to the cost of the best current-generation or close to market components and architectures at proposal submission time).
?	Fast charging of a C segment vehicle demonstrator from 20 to 80 percent in 10 minutes with currently available 350kW chargers.
?	Practical range increases over travel time (~20 percent increase with the same battery weight) with overall higher efficiency and easier thermal management of the whole powertrain allowing reasonably sized, lower cost and environmentally friendly batteries to perform long trips conveniently.

?	Significant advancements in efficiency (reduction of losses by 25%) versus the state of the art of the targeted application with a special attention to partial load condition in EVs and charging stations alike.
?	Backwards compatibility and reliability aspects.
?	Improved application safety and robustness that contribute to a better user buy-in.
?	Improved resource efficiency with better lifecycle impact and recycling capability ª contributing to a circular economy approach.
Scope: In the last decade, the more and more demanding power and application requirements led to an increase of board net HV voltage from an initial 400V level to 800V in the latest electric vehicles, already trickling down to lower categories. Significantly higher voltages (indicatively, in the 1200V region) may be the next logical step and become standard in the next decade, providing benefits in terms of efficiency, copper use and weight. If not properly managed, they could have a constraining impact on the overall architecture especially in terms of DC charging and efficiency for low power use. Thus, new challenges for the powertrain arise in the areas of the motor, battery, cabling, couplers etc. as well as in electromagnetic compatibility and the development and integration of new power semiconductors.
To successfully address the expected outcomes in the constant drive to improve efficiency and performance while increasing affordability, proposals are expected to address several of the following aspects capable of demonstrating the achievement of the intended objectives at system level:
?	Assess in a holistic way the positive and negative impacts of higher voltage levels at vehicle and powertrain level, defining the best option for the post-800V EV generation.
?	Development and integration of power-electronic components with new concepts for component miniaturisation and modularity. Also, solutions that can transition rapidly from modular to integrated systems need to be identified, depending on demand and eco- balance.
?	Topologies adapted to advanced wide-bandgap semiconductors and new materials, leading to higher power density.
?	Modular powertrain platforms, with the aim of coming closer to a full mechanical, electrical or thermal integration of the three main systems (electric motor, power electronics systems and battery pack) benefitting from the smaller sizes and cooling demands due to higher voltage.

Scope: In order to reduce the overall cost of electric vehicles modularity, scalability and the development of strategies for their implementation will become increasingly important in the future. With the expected introduction of new cell technologies, specific choices for connections, cooling system concepts and materials for housing will play a crucial role in the battery performance improvements and the battery integration in the vehicle structure. The development and integration of structural, thermal and mechanical aspects (at different levels of modularity or integration) will need to be improved, while exploiting the intrinsic advantages of innovative type of cells.
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:

?	Smart thermal management systems for both heating and cooling, with smart interfaces to the vehicle systems (including energy-efficient preconditioning, using internal or external energy sources whilst charging), contributing to further improvements in the overall battery system efficiency and optimizing the overall battery system, also in consideration of passenger comfort.

?	Improved designs, architectures and models of interoperable multipoint megawatt charging systems for future mass deployment of Heavy-Duty trucks and concepts for managing their grid impact.
?	Tools to identify the energy needs and the charging profiles of the electric vehicles that are expected to charge on megawatt charging systems.

?	Improved modelling of the optimal geographical locations for large-scale megawatt charging hubs for Heavy and Medium Duty Vehicles and multiplexed Light Duty passenger/commercial vehicles usage at traffic peak times while also considering the relevant challenges to the grids and their mitigation with smart charging concepts, in consideration of locally available energy grids capacities and local energy storage.

?	The proposed concept for a charging stations with at least four flexible megawatt charging points of 1MW or more will be demonstrated at the end of the project, each of these points being in turn also capable of recharging at least four lighter vehicles.
Scope: Next generation battery electric vehicles need to be more energy efficient and affordable, which means to keep battery size to the practical minimum. Megawatt charging is then required to meet the demand for long operational range with even shorter charging times. Ultra-high-power charging on-board and off-board sub-systems design is, as a first step, covered in topic HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-08. The present topic covers their evolution towards multi-charger hubs that cater for a widespread deployment of these vehicles on the 2030 horizon. Limited on-board systems optimisation may be included if properly justified. At the same time each charger in these charging hubs will be usable for multiple lighter vehicles with lower power (150-350 kW) during peak times such as weekend or holiday periods, when demand from heavy duty vehicles may be lower. This will also require concepts for topologies capable for accommodating one heavy vehicle or 4-6 light vehicles in each charging spot.
Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:

?	Consider typical demands along significant TEN-T corridors, including with severe conditions, as well as opportunities for sharing and balancing power  supply within

Such terminals/ hubs for charging should offer charging on non-discriminatory basis.
?	Particular attention should be paid to the real needs of end users, including optimised infrastructure locations, its reverse impact on the traffic flow, ease of use and interoperable protocols that do not hinder universal use across different countries; the identification and analysis of potential regulatory aspects and barriers for relevant standardisation activities is encouraged.
?	The developed tools should have the capability to map the optimal locations for a fast and high-power charging infrastructure (already built-up logistics hubs, truck service centres, truck and bus depots, and for new ones also considering the permitting process), offering planning information including to the developers of the targeted infrastructure. For optimisation of the overall system use, services and tools should be developed keeping into account on-board EV system characteristics.

Core functions of the electric powertrain or vehicle dynamics are primarily enabled and controlled via software. Function updates are at the fingertip of the end-users to offer maximum customer benefits and satisfaction. Such next generation modelling and simulation tools & methods empowering e.g., software-driven development, automated engineering as well as credible simulation pave the way to make mobility safer, more sustainable and more comfortable in a new way.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Design and validate digital tools for the automotive industry for enabling best possible combination of digital development and digital operation for innovative zero-emission solutions enabling up to 20% energy consumption reduction by e.g. deploying always latest software-driven energy saving functions becoming available during vehicles entire lifetime and to ensure performance, security, safety and reliability by design.
?	Increase speed of innovation by optimising the utilisation of data (engineering, operational, infrastructure data etc.) in an effective and efficient way (synthesis and utilisation of data).
?	Contribute to the development of solutions for reliable ?virtual? decision-making based on digital twins and for enhancement of the credibility of simulations based on process and artefact quality measures, as well as KPI-driven quality assurance and traceability.
?	Method and tools for reliable modelling and simulation of total vehicle systems including its environment.
?	Significantly enhance the capabilities in design, development and application of ?software-defined? EV and thus strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry.
?	Improve product quality, improve decision making efficiency, quality, and exploiting operation data and thus contributing to the reduction of the overall development time.
Scope: The data driven development of software-defined functions and systems of EVs (e.g. in context of battery and e-motor control, predictive eco-driving functions or control  of vehicle dynamics, as well as comfort) requires the use of improved tools across domains (e.g. mechanical, dynamic, electrical, and acoustical) and scales (from component to vehicle in a mobility scenario) as well as a deep understanding of the vehicle operation in real life.

However, the current development and design framework does not allow such complex software-defined functions and systems to be addressed in an integrated manner, resulting often in solutions optimised for a specific operating point that is only partially representative of real use conditions and lacking the resource-efficient reuse of these solutions across multiple vehicle platforms. Moreover, the development of vehicles that are constantly capable to adapt during lifetime (e.g. by remote programming capabilities) is also not sufficiently enabled. As such the scope of this call topic is expected to go far beyond today?s product development as addressed in previous Horizon 2020 topics (e.g. H2020-GV-2018 ?Virtual product development and production of all types of electrified vehicles and components?).
In order to fully exploit the potential of software-defined EV functions and vehicles, an advanced dedicated digital development framework is needed. Proposals under this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:
?	Design and validation of robust digital tools to efficiently and effectively develop complex EVs that are increasingly software-defined.
?	Advanced methods for development of trustworthy (24/7 available, secure, safe) software-defined EV solutions.
?	Promoting the use and adaption of conceptional tools and demonstrate integration into development frameworks for virtual approval (early demonstrators) that are applicable to all EV types considered in 2ZERO (from L-category to Heavy Duty vehicles).
?	Concepts enabling the feedback to and use of all types of data (e.g. engineering data, real-life operational data of EVs) in the product development of software-defined vehicle functions including automated update of the applied digital tools and models.
Close collaboration is expected between selected projects under this topic and modalities need to be outlines in the proposal.

?	Develop and demonstrate new and innovative mission focused and efficient Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV) battery electric concepts to address new requirements (e.g. growing of e-commerce overall and in segments such as groceries or cold chain products, urban logistics consolidation schemes) from zero emission logistics processes in cities increasing the affordability and scalability of the proposed solutions.
?	Demonstrate scalable zero emission real life operations in the city environment including charging and building synergies between the new LCVs and zero emission Heavy Duty Vehicles operations to address user needs in a sustainable and safe manner.

Scope: The main scope of this call is to deliver new urban optimized light commercial zero- emission vehicles with a focus on goods transport, that are affordable, safe, sustainable and reliable and with a strong engagement from freight services users and fleet owners in the definition of requirements and testing. The focus will be to identify and overcome the main barriers for the development of new LCV concepts for urban and sub-urban logistics and freight mobility. Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:
?	Engage with users of the vehicles, define requirements, expectations and potential developments that may influence future demand for these vehicles as well as considering the integration of vehicles in existing and future charging infrastructures.
?	Develop and demonstrate new designs, shapes and functionalities of Light Commercial Vehicles to meet current and future needs for commercial delivery of goods, including safety aspects.
?	Demonstrate the developed vehicles and operational concepts considering current and future demands for these vehicles in a growing e-commerce market for deliveries and returns of parcels, groceries and refrigerated goods and addressing the challenges

holistically (i.e. by demonstrating the concepts in actual current or new logistics operations including charging and addressing requirements in cities with extended zero emission zones).
?	Establish synergies and links with new logistics concepts developed in R&I projects focused on logistics operations and innovative concepts (such as the Physical Internet).

Project results are expected to contribute to at least three of the following expected outcomes:
?	Primarily, further increase the scientific understanding related to the impact of aerosols on clouds as well as the contribution of aviation NOx emissions to climate change.
?	Investigate further into the potential policy measures included in the EASA study269, including whether they are proportionate, feasible and reduce the overall climate impact (CO2 and non-CO2 emissions).
?	Perform detailed analysis of optimal relation between costs and climate.
?	Perform engine gas and particle emissions characterisation, when data is incomplete or unavailable.
?	Perform flight tests and demonstrate the benefits and fuel burn trade-offs of avoiding climate sensitive regions.
?	Perform hydrogen and aviation drop-in fuel research with an eye towards reducing further non-CO2 emissions.
?	Develop real-time decision-support software for airlines and ATM, to predict the location and global warming impact of contrail and contrail cirrus formation.
Scope: EU-studies show that approximately 50-75% of aviation?s climate impact is caused by non-CO2 emissions. It is because of their local geographical character, their dependency on atmospheric phenomena, the incomplete understanding and uncertainty as well as operational trade-offs that non-CO2 emissions have been less-targeted so far from international and European regulatory measures. Recent studies show that cost-effective mitigation measures are possible, provided that focused R&I actions together with flight tests resolve the final uncertainties. However, today any avoidance that increases CO2 emissions, even at a net reduction of overall climate warming impact, introduces a complex policy issue of mitigating short-term versus long term climate effects.
Recent EU and National-funded research activities (i.e. FP7-REACT4C, SESAR- FLyATM4E, ALARM, SINOPTICA, DLR-WeCARE, H2020-ACACIA, HE-BECOM)
characterized better the contrail formation and provided more insight in the aviation NOx emissions and ozone formation. The studies also showed that if aircraft operations are only optimized for fuel use, they may have an increased climate impact, since non-CO2 effects may compensate the reduced warming from CO2 savings.

269	COM(2020) 747 final - Updated analysis of the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation and potential policy measures pursuant to EU Emissions Trading System Directive Article 30(4).

Avoiding climate sensitive regions has a large potential in reducing climate impact at relatively low costs without causing significantly more CO2 emissions that outweigh the overall climate effect. The integration of data analytics and weather forecasting into advanced decision-support software tools that are able to predict real-time the contrail formation as well as propose alternative paths, are well in-line with the scope of this topic. This topic aims to integrate and provide clear operational guidelines supported by validated flight tests. Engine gas and particle emissions characterisation, when data is incomplete or unavailable, is in-line with the scope of this topic.
As a follow-up of EASA study, on non-CO2 climate impacts, and for the standardisation in view of safety considerations and future certification, the involvement of EASA is necessary (e.g. as part of the steering group), as well as the coordination with ICAO relevant groups (CAEP).
Synergies with SESAR3 should also be exploited ? in view of the relevant topics in the SESAR3 JU bi-annual work programme 2022-2023. Furthermore, international collaboration for research and Air-Traffic Management should be sought (e.g. SESAR/NextGen).
Synergies may also be considered with the Digital Sky Demonstrators, including in particular flights for demonstrating green trajectories or equipped with sensors to collect data for the assessment of the non-CO2 impact on aviation. Finally, synergies with Destination Earth should also be sought.",

Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
?

The toolbox, including impact assessments, should also be able to perform trade-off studies, include all aircraft types, address the most cost-effective policy options as a function of time (towards up to 2070) and allow policy makers, industry and scientists to take informed decisions.
Scope: The proposal is expected to build on and improve an already established reference European toolbox (e.g. developed in retained proposal(s) from HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01-
14)	able to assess the impact of European aviation R&I, which is deployed to perform impact assessments of European relevant aviation R&I actions in Horizon Europe. The European

Aviation R&I policy, and aviation policy at large, need a European capability (as open-source as possible) to assess what has been achieved and provide forecast analysis of the expected outcome of technological, operational, fuel and policy options such as market-based-measures (MBM) choices. The toolbox, through its impact assessments, should provide insight that will be used in the communication of the impact and achievements of European, National and private aviation R&I investments. Impact assessments performed in Horizon partnerships and missions are a subset of this toolbox.
The toolbox should:

?	incorporate methodological, science-based and validated models that can be traced;
?	pay particular attention ? beyond CO2 emissions - to non-CO2 emissions and climate- sensitive regions as well as address interdependencies (e.g. noise in the airport vicinity);
?	address and improve (as a result of new technologies, aircraft configurations and missions) climate-assessment methods and optimised trajectories towards identifying promising mitigation options;

?	Design of concepts and validation of an experimental aircraft that will test, validate and accelerate radical new technologies and aircraft configurations that go well beyond the state-of-the-art;
?	Deliver feasibility studies of the targeted aircraft concept, towards a preliminary design review, making use of sound/proven advanced simulation and modelling techniques;

?	Provide a preliminary implementation and execution plan for the targeted aircraft concept, including a business and operating model.
Proposals may also address any of the following expected outcome(s):

?	Propose new approaches to shorten the time to market, such as through digitalisation of key processes, virtual certification techniques, open innovation, etc.
Scope: Faced with the urgent imperative to decarbonise aviation, the industry is expected to be prepared to change from the current traditional aircraft designs evolved over decades and move to new sustainable disruptive solutions across its complete portfolio of aircraft for the long-term.
A fundamental steppingstone to achieve the long-term goal of developing more sustainable disruptive solutions are experimental aircraft which have shown over the decades to have a lasting influence on the industry?s long-term design choices and competitiveness. Experimental aircraft have been essential to de-risk and understand the possibilities of new solutions before irreversible decisions need to be made.
In addition, experimental aircraft programmes have an agglomeration effect on key skills and facilities throughout the research and development value chain, as well as providing a notable source of inspiration to multiple generations of future aspiring aerospace professionals and society in general.
Therefore, this type of endeavour is an ideal opportunity for a pan-European approach to lead the way and build upon the findings from the H2020-RINGO272 project where a strong need was found for sub-scale to full-scale flying demonstrators for validation and demonstration of new configurations and concepts. These flying test beds should focus on innovations that go well beyond anything currently addressed in Clean Aviation and should focus on generating impact in 2050 and beyond.
This topic aims at significantly reinforcing the EUs leading position in Aerospace innovation through radical, experimental innovation needed for zero-emission aircraft of the future. By creating a flying, experimental test bed the twin transition of Europe towards a climate neutral and digital society will be accelerated and EU global industrial leadership will be

strengthened. The European flying testbed, the E-Plane will enable disruptive ideas to be tested and will shape the sustainable, zero-emission air transport of tomorrow.
The concept aircrafts are also expected to address long-range (>4000km) missions, where new radical configurations are still needed to be explored to fill gaps for implementation in time to help ensure global aviation carbon neutrality by 2050. To allow for new, disruptive business models, no passenger range or payload is prescribed. However, future competitiveness of the concept should be addressed.
This topic should contribute to the European Skills Agenda The topic addresses primarily to RTOs/Academia/SMEs, with guidance from suppliers and aircraft integrators. One retained project for this topic will allow meaningful validation and feasibility studies and common platform",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D5-01-11," Achieving high voltage, low weight, efficient electric powertrains for sustainable waterborne transport (ZEWT Partnership)",4/18/2024,RIA,12/7/2023,,,Around 7.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:

?	Demonstrate increased performance, efficiency, feasibility and reliability of battery installations in high voltage on board distribution systems and thereby facilitate the greater deployment of battery electric shipping.
?	Development and validation of battery real-time condition monitoring systems with predictive analytics integrated algorithms.
?	Demonstration of high-capacity energy storage systems above 1 MWh directly interfaced to medium voltage AC (3.3 kV or above) or DC (above 1 kV) power systems, by modular approaches.
?	Demonstrate the feasibility of an innovative low weight, high-energy density battery concept in demonstrators, considering maritime and inland waterway transport applications, including demonstration of on-board battery safety.
?	Efficient modular redundant conversion systems with low voltage battery modules at floating potential and insulation for cost effective integrated battery modules and conversion systems are designed.
?	Evaluation of sustainable life cycle management of electrical energy storage systems.
Scope: The voltage level of battery installations on-board vessels is typically limited and within the regulations for low voltage installations. By increasing the voltage level of the on- board distribution system, the energy conversion can achieve higher efficiencies and be more compact, due to the smaller cross-sectional area of conductors and lower losses. However, for waterborne transport (waterborne transport refers to both maritime and inland waterway transport) applications, challenges remain related to the design of conversion systems and insulation methods for integrating low voltage battery systems in high voltage AC or DC distribution systems. The necessary regulatory aspects also need to be defined to facilitate market take up for waterborne transport. Although e.g. high-voltage Li-Ion battery packs may be presently applied, the current state-of-the-art still offers solutions that are too heavy to enable electrification of a wider range of larger waterborne transport assets. However new developments show potential for a reduction of battery pack weight. Further study of the adaptation and the on-board integration solutions available for recently developed technologies, such as Li-Ion NMC, LTO, LFP is needed.
Building on the current state of the art solutions should contribute towards the battery electrification of a wider range of vessel types, for both maritime and inland waterway transport which are characterized by the need for larger battery systems and longer autonomy.
Projects are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Design of battery management systems of high voltage battery installations for AC and DC distribution systems in waterborne transport.
?	Design and control of conversion systems, insulation design and insulation coordination.

?	Adoption of low weight electrical energy storage designed to be integrated on board (e.g. not an on deck ISO container).
?	Sustainability and circularity criteria to be preferably adapted for whole life of on-board battery pack solutions (i.e. second-life applications).
?	Identification and characterisation of the specific requirements needed for inland waterway and maritime transport.
?	Development of battery safety concept that is in principle suitable for class approval, especially for large battery spaces on-board, considering detection, ventilation and fire suppression technology.
The new solutions should also contribute significantly to the overall safety for on-board battery applications (i.e. for toxic emissions, fire propagation, etc.). The form factor, the battery management system and the interface with the shore side electric grid should also be considered.
The projects are expected to ensure synergies with the Horizon Europe Batteries Partnership and are encouraged to envisage clustering activities with the project funded from the topics HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-02 and HORIZON-CL5-2021-D2-01-03.

?	Development of at least three market ready vessel design solutions to address short sea shipping, inland waterway transport and high seas shipping making innovative use of combinations of close to market (TRL 7 or higher) emission reduction and efficiency improvement technologies to reduce emissions from shipping in line with the expectations within the EUs ?Fit for 55? legislative package.
?	Quantitative assessment of the designs towards achieving significant emissions reductions consistent with the EU?s ?Fit for 55? package objectives and the IMO?s Carbon Intensity Indicator through verifiable KPI?s.
?	Facilitation of the continuous improvement and upgrading of existing vessels to increase efficiency and reduce emissions through the measurement and bench marking of operational profiles.
?	Quantification of the contribution towards cutting emissions from a range of emission reduction technologies on a life cycle basis. Including the separate and joint consideration of design and operations within relevant environments. Enable assessment of the retrofit and refurbishment options of applied emission reduction technologies.
?	Support accelerated conversion of inland and maritime vessels s towards better energy efficiency and reduced emissions.
?	Development of robust business models for the design concepts, to ensure a high probability of commercial European deployment and the expectation of becoming operational by 2030.
Scope: Legislative proposals within the EU?s ?Fit for 55? package targeting the reduction of waterborne transport emissions will assess emissions reductions based on operational data collected within the framework of the EU?s MRV regulation. Internationally, for global maritime shipping, the forthcoming IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator and Data Collections System (DCS) will be used. Vessels visiting EU ports will need to provide data to ensure compliance with both MRV (EU) and DCS (IMO) data requirements. This change from

assessing emission reductions based on design to the direct measurement and verification of actual operational emissions requires a new approach to design. Consequently, the vessel design process will need to employ modelling and simulation techniques which take into account the vessel?s expected operational profile and life cycle so as to ensure that the delivered vessel or modification will deliver the expected emission reductions in the ?real world?
For new builds, present improvements in ship energy efficiency have reduced consumption by 15-30% compared to equivalent reference ships in 2008. Contributing to fit for 55 objectives, the challenge is to develop at least three concept vessels which will further improve energy efficiency by at least 20%, compared to a 2022 reference performance for equivalent ships.
This ?design for operation? approach will integrate and combine both operational energy savings and emission reduction technologies. Several technologies and solutions to be combined and integrated should be chosen so as to provide the largest impact and these are expected to already be individually demonstrated or developed to TRL 7. This could for example concern various combinations of; power conversion/electrification /energy devices, sustainable climate neutral low emission fuels, HVAC, energy storage, operations, smart energy monitoring, renewables including wind assistance, hydrodynamics, cold ironing, slow steaming, just in time scheduling, propeller designs etc.
In order to address the above-mentioned challenge, proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:
?	Energy system modelling and fast simulation assessment to demonstrate the expected energy efficiency gains and life-cycle emission reductions achieved by the resulting designs within their operating reference cases. A holistic/systemic approach should be applied to the design, which is to be based upon total vessel energy needs for use within reference operating profiles and business cases.
?	A minimum of three vessel concept designs and use cases are expected to be developed including the following vessel types: short-sea, inland waterway and high-seas. For each vessel type, retrofit solutions for the baseline design (from 2008) should be proposed, as well as a completely new design.
?	Development of an open-source design assessment tool which can be used to assess the operational Carbon Intensity of vessel designs.
?	Development of decision-support or automation systems to facilitate the most effective implementation of operational energy efficiency improvements.
?	Plans for exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. Development of business models to facilitate the deployment of the resulting vessel design concepts, in particular addressing financing, market needs and possibilities to support first of a kind deployment. Considering the potential of opportunities within EU support schemes such as the Connecting Europe

Facility, Climate Change Innovation Fund and regional funds. Proposals are expected to demonstrate a clear and credible pipeline from the development to the operational deployment of the developed designs by 2030. This should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used.
When appropriate, activities may also address the definition of a secure knowledge sharing platform to enable the necessary data-transfer to obtain detailed operational performance information.

HORIZON-CL5-2024-D5-01-13, Demonstration of Technologies to minimise underwater noise generated by waterborne transport (ZEWT Partnership),4/18/2024,IA,12/7/2023,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Demonstration of underwater radiated noise (URN) reduction through large scale demonstrators or retrofitted ships employing URN reduction modifications and assessment through verifiable KPIs.

?	Demonstration of the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of noise mitigation devices, mitigation measures and management options and assessment through verifiable KPIs.
?	Development of standards for the specification of source noise levels by equipment suppliers and shipyards, which build upon the current state-of-the art.
?	Has increased the awareness of European ship owners of the environmental impact from underwater noise and the possibilities to reduce noise and its harm to the marine environment.
?	Provide evidence to regulators concerning waterborne transport underwater noise to better take into account operational conditions and environmental impact within any forthcoming regulation.
Scope: Whilst on-going research seeks to characterize the underwater radiated noise (URN) which poses the greatest threat to aquatic species and the marine environment as well as characterizing potentially promising solutions to reduce the impacts of URN, the demonstration of technologies to minimize the harmful impacts from waterborne transport URN remains less developed. Current on-site URN measurement campaigns do not address all potential waterborne transport related noise sources and selecting suitable mitigation measures remains a challenging task as there are many options for URN reduction. Consequently, assessments need to be made on a case-by-case basis considering environmental, operational and economic factors and when relevant taking into account previous work such as the European Marine Board position paper on underwater noise. An important challenge is to predict URN at the design stage to be able to implement less noisy environmentally friendly solutions from an early stage. This challenge is faced both at equipment design level and at the ship integration stage. Consequences of the noise reduction solutions for GHG emissions should be considered.
Current approaches to the regulation of URN focus on controlled criteria (fixed speed, no waves etc.), whilst ships operate at various speeds, loads and sea states which further complicate the challenge of designing a quiet ship suitable for a wide range of conditions. A further challenge is to be able to operate a noise measurement system on-board which can provide instantaneous information to the crew on the ship?s operational radiated noise. Noting that an informed balance may also need to be taken between GHG emissions and URN.
In order to address the above-mentioned challenge, proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:
?	Development of methods and models to predict under water radiated noise levels in the design phase.
?	Conduct modelling and field studies to improve the effectiveness, safety and cost- effectiveness of noise mitigation devices, mitigation measures and management options in different sea states and in different ship loads. The identified solutions should be

tested and demonstrated through large scale demonstrators that may, when appropriate, and feasible, also include the monitoring of the response of key susceptible species.
?	Projects should develop systems for on-board measurement of noise, and decision support systems to reduce radiated noise whilst maintaining energy efficiency in normal operation.
?	The project should build upon the current state of play, for example taking into account the H2020 project SATURN and the LIFE+ project PIAQUO to support the development of standards for the specification of source noise levels by equipment suppliers and shipyards. The projects are expected to propose synergies and clustering with related projects and activities addressing underwater noise, including from non- transport sources.
?	In addition, the project should address communication towards the European ship owners and operators to raise awareness, inform about the environmental impact and on the technical possibilities to reduce their noise and its impact on the underwater environment.
?	Engage with regulators to raise awareness on noise from waterborne transport depending on operational status, weather conditions, loading conditions, water conditions (depth, type of bottom, temperature salinity etc.) the frequency and type of noise and its impact on the environment for the purpose of considering them in future potential regulations.

?	Enabling reduced emissions from waterborne transport through increased electrification including hybrid power systems.
?	Demonstration of the feasibility of a secondary smart DC grid (engineering framework, distribution/protection devices).
?	Demonstration of smart management and control of hybrid electric plants, combining different energy sources, including sustainable climate neutral fuels so as to minimize total lifecycle net GHG emissions

?	Assessment through verifiable KPIs of the operating costs reductions and the reduction in emissions by cutting energy consumption and extending service intervals of the generator sets.
?	Assessment through verifiable KPIs of the efficiency and power density improvements to reduce the overall volume and weight.
Scope: Primary DC systems are now applied on multiple types of ships, employing battery energy storage. The application of DC grids on-board has already started and will grow significantly because of its promising aspects such as reduction of complexity, increased modularity and improved integration. However, further progress is required to unlock the full potential of an on-board DC grid for large ship applications (over 5000 GT) addressing the

entire network for both primary and secondary (auxiliary) distribution system, taking into account the various on-board applications of ship's electrification systems (e.g. high-power fuel cells, batteries, etc.) The challenge is to focus not only on secondary distribution, but also on the integration/interconnection of new sustainable primary power systems within a DC grid network serving the entire ship
In order to address the above-mentioned challenge, proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:
?	Develop high TRL innovative power electronic systems (e.g. converters, circuit breakers with logic selectivity) adapted and certified for waterborne transport applications.
?	Develop a new concept of smart, flexible, plug-and-play DC power grid which leverages the capability of new power electronic systems and allows for different DC power generation systems based on sustainable alternative energy sources.
?	Research the impact of design choices, safety measures and integration on the ship. This will require the development and on-board integration of high-power equipment and systems to complement the electrical grid (e.g. solid-state protection, solid-state transformers, Silicon-Carbide Power Devices,
?	Develop a prototype system at small scale (min. 100kW) within a real waterborne transport environment. Demonstrate the functionality and the integration of its components, prove the possibilities for further upscaling. Prove the feasibility and benefits of distributing main power based on DC instead of AC.
?	Validate the system with classification societies ensuring the highest standards for safety and reliability.
?	Develop standards for on-board DC microgrids and communication protocols which are particularly valuable for large ships where there is differentiation between the electrical supplies towards different zones (e.g. zones with ICE and zones with RES systems).
?	Integrate new power electronic systems within the ship?s network with advanced control systems to cope with variable loads and high levels of DC currents to interrupt.
?	The emissions, efficiency and operational savings are expected to be demonstrated on a relevant ship type to validate the research results. The transferability of the applications to be applied has to be proven towards a range of vessel types, including those which have larger battery systems and longer autonomy. The demonstration is expected to serve as a reference for a wide spectrum of ship's types using electrical propulsion and auxiliary power.
?	Where relevant, synergies and collaboration should be planned with the related activities and projects arising from linked Horizon Europe initiatives, in particular the Batteries and Clean Hydrogen JU partnerships.

?	Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used.
All relevant stakeholders (electrical distribution and protection manufacturers, engineering companies, manufacturers of electrical equipment, users, shipyards, etc.) should participate in proposals in view of the systems development.

HORIZON-CL5-2024-D5-01-15, Advanced digitalisation and modelling utilizing operational and other data to support zero emission waterborne transport (ZEWT Partnership),4/18/2024,IA,12/7/2023,,,Around 7.70-1,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Development and demonstration of a platform for Integrated Green Vessel Digital Twins that will provide a basis to continuously improve the environmental performance of vessels over their entire life cycle.

?	Improved environmental performance through verifiable KPIs.
?	Proven applicability of the platform to a wide variety of vessel operations throughout the vessels? lifetime, by using model-based systems engineering, simulation and hardware in the loop approaches.
Scope: State-of-the-art of Digital Twins (DT) applied to waterborne transport are typically characterised by a focus on specific limited aspects of the design or operation of a vessel based on numerical simulations. Integrated Green Vessel DTs, which take an integrated approach to combine design and operation to improve efficiency and reduce emissions are not well addressed. Furthermore, aspects of open (software) architecture, data standards, security guarantees and data sovereignty of data owners are also not comprehensively addressed. Whilst some advances in data integration for different applications have been made, a comprehensive global integration of data remains missing.
These higher levels of integration between different functions of an Integrated Green Vessel DT (e.g. during design and operation of waterborne transport assets) require both complex multi-physics simulations and advanced levels of data organisation. This leads to the need for higher computational efficiency to meet future requirements in terms of accuracy, and the integration of the digital representation of suitable technologies for the transformation of vessels into ?Green Vessels? within an Integrated Green DT that will aim to improve the vessels environmental performance.
Integrated Green Vessel DTs need to be applicable throughout the life cycle of the vessel, from initial design, to detailed design, engineering and production, operation, retrofitting, and circular end of life. To make best use of an Integrated Green Vessel DT, it should allow addressing optimisation for enhanced energy efficiency and reduced environmental footprint in a consistent way throughout the lifecycle of the vessel. This will require a thorough consideration of potential operational conditions as well as possible future regulatory changes. The Green Vessel DT will play a key role in design and operation of future zero or low emission vessels as well as their through-life sustainability upgrades. Mapping all relevant data influencing operational environmental performance, it will be the basis for decision support for operational (AI-based) optimisation, for considering the use of for example propulsion changes, retrofits, alternative fuel options, use of renewable energies solutions) and predictive maintenance.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Development of an Integrated Green Digital Twin.
?	Make best use of available (simulation) concepts and consider all relevant life-cycle aspects, including end of life disposal.
?	Incorporate all relevant aspects of physics simulation, design and operational planning and optimisation as well as data organisation and storage, integrating also real data obtained from monitoring and measurements.

?	Ensure the system will be adaptable to consider all potentially relevant retrofits needed to meet future regulations and changes in operational profile both during initial design and throughout the vessels lifecycle.
?	Assessment of the environmental performance through verifiable KPIs.
?	Optimisation of the vessel?s equipment in operational conditions in order to provide the best environmental and economic solution for a given waterborne transport operation.
?	Use open standards, libraries and tools to create generic and reusable solutions applicable to a wide range of waterborne assets.
?	Ensure the interoperability of data models, address data ownership and integrity of data sets as well as ensuring security against cyber and physical threats.
?	For case studies on at least 2 different ship types, test and demonstrate the developed digital twin model to quantify the improved environmental performance and efficiency achieved as a result.

?	A full understanding of the business model, labour, financial and commercial barriers to the take up of innovative low and/or zero emission solutions for waterborne transport, including consideration of ship financing and investment structures, charter and other contracts.
?	Identification of potential solutions to overcome business model and commercial barriers to the take up of innovative low and zero emission solutions in waterborne transport.
?	Understanding of the industrial capacity and how it would be scheduled to retrofit and/or replace the current European fleet to meet 2030 and 2050 emission reduction and pollution targets. Considering all vessels operating within the European region, including inland waterway transport vessels, short sea shipping services (including ferries and cargo vessels), cruise and offshore vessels;
?	Increase commitment from the wider waterborne sector, including finance, contracting insurance, charterers, operators, owners, public stake holders, technology providers as well as civil society towards recognizing the importance of European waterborne transport, its environmental objectives and the consequential economic impacts.
Scope: The European Green Deal sets ambitious objectives to transform Europe into the first climate neutral continent by 2050 This presents a valuable opportunity for the European industry, and in particular for the waterborne transport sector, where Europe leads in high technology and green energy efficient shipping development. Also digitalisation has an impact on reducing emissions and increasing efficiency, while increasing safety, security, and

reliability of the waterborne transport, and therefore is already impacting the business models and dynamics of the sector.
Whilst Europe is still a worldwide leader in advanced, digital and green shipping, there is a lack of take up of new technologies within the wider waterborne transport market. In part, this is a reflection of the sectors' conservatism and reluctance to change unless driven by regulation. It is also hindered by the complex commercial structures and finance models which can distance the interests of ship owners who commission new builds, financiers who commoditise vessel value by type, operators who can benefit from lower fuel consumption as well as cargo owners who may benefit from ?environmentally friendly image? and final points of sale where the use of low emission shipping can be a potential commercial advantage. Whilst new business models and labelling schemes to better incentivize green shipping have been developed, they are yet to be widely established and are largely unknown. There is a need to objectively analyse the segments of the waterborne transport sector, and within each segment characterize the business models, identify the barriers to the take up innovative low and zero-emission waterborne transport solutions and in cooperation with the stakeholders to propose commercial models which can provide a better incentive for increasing the investment in low or zero-emission solutions in the European waterborne transport sector.
Furthermore, it is important to increase awareness of the public and the broader non research waterborne sector about the economic and environmental importance of the European waterborne transport sector, highlighting its commitment, ability and opportunities to develop and implement competitive solutions which will meet the ambitious objectives reflected in the European Green Deal.
To ensure a coordinated approach to develop zero-emission, digital, automated and competitive European waterborne transport the participation of all types of both private and public stakeholders, including financiers, charterers and others within the commercial side of the waterborne business community should be envisaged. Cooperation with relevant existing initiatives, like the European Sustainable Shipping Forum, CESNI, the Waterborne Technology Platform and others, will be key. In addition, it should be ensured that proposals take into account the results of relevant R&I projects (including Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe) and relevant studies. Proposals should address all of the following:
?	Identify business models and the financial and commercial barriers to the take up of innovative low and/or zero emission solutions for waterborne transport. The financial investment, labelling and contract structures as well as the new possibilities enabled by digitalisation should be considered. An analysis of the different responsibilities and business motivations between charterer, cargo owner, ship owner, point of sale etc. should also be taken into account.
?	Analyse the needs and timing to retrofit and replace the current European fleet (including inland waterway transport vessels, ferries, short sea shipping, cruise ships and offshore vessels). The analysis should be combined with an overview of the European capacity (with respect to technology and skilled workforce) available to retrofit these

vessels and identify any capacity gaps for the timely implementation of the European Green Deal emission targets;
?	Provide an analysis of where disincentives exist to the increased deployment of innovative low and/or zero emission and smart shipping, within different market segments/ The analysis should consider for example the investment decision cycle: finance models, bunkering and fuel supply infrastructure, availability, longevity and costs of technologies, possibilities to retrofit/build a vessel timely, properly skilled workforce, etc. and propose incentives and improvements to the business models such as new contract models and financing structures.;
?	Organise specific communication and exploitation activities towards relevant stakeholders outside the participants of the project to ensure that all stakeholders from EU Member States/Associated countries are informed about the solutions developed;
?	To assure a beneficial societal impact from the activities, relevant social science and humanities expertise are expected to be taken into account, including the active contribution from SSH experts and/or institutions.

calls that supported nearly 50 joint projects with ?56M of funding. This has established valuable coordination between national and European research, including with the waterborne transport sector. The benefits from synergies towards the achievement of common goals which align with the objectives of the ZEWT partnership. This requires better coordination and harmonisation of individual national funding programmes as well as consideration and alignment with the ZEWT partnership and its related calls and projects.

?	The air pollutant emissions from combustion-based heavy-duty vehicles (including Non- Road Mobile Machinery like excavators, bulldozers, harvesters etc.), aircraft and ships using alternative fuels, with a broad coverage of existing (at least in advanced prototype form) powertrains and exhaust after treatment technologies, are measured and characterised according to real-life scenarios of use.
?	Emerging pollutants resulting from the use of novel low-carbon fuels are identified and quantified.
?	In light of recent WHO guidelines, concentrations of ultrafine particle emissions down to at least 10nm are also measured and chemical compounds present on those particles are characterised (in particular carcinogenic compounds like aldehydes, PAHs and NPAHs).
?	Air pollution exposure projections based on plausible technological trajectories are produced, up to the year 2050.
?	Technology packages to mitigate the emerging forms of pollution are proposed and projections updated accordingly.
?	Reliable scientific data to guide future policy and technology choices following the ?do no significant harm? principle is provided.
?	Guiding principles for optimized Design, Operation and Maintenance, to minimize emissions, for designers and operators.

Scope: Low-carbon fuels proposed for use in the next decade can be covered, however the priority is to the low-carbon fuels that have already been demonstrated in real world applications or are foreseen to gain market share according to the projections made in the context of the ?Fit for 55? package.
A complete polluting emissions speciation should be performed in different working conditions encountered in real use. Therefore, the pollutants expected to be quantified should go beyond the list of the currently regulated ones.
Since accessing ships and aircrafts for testing is not straightforward, and no fuel or engine development work should be funded in the proposals, cooperation with existing projects where such fuels are tested is expected.
A study of possible mitigation actions should focus on any new pollutants that have a high toxicity, a high global warming potential, or both.
The potential from upstream emissions and of secondary pollutants formation in the atmosphere deriving from the new emissions should also be considered and quantified. Any trade-offs between GHG effects over the next 20-year period, health and other environmental impacts should be identified and assessed.
The projects should assess impacts on human health.

1.	Advanced vehicle technologies and solutions which optimise usability, perception and experience on-board, and when boarding/off-boarding, in terms of security, privacy, well-being, health and assistance.
2.	Enhanced inclusiveness and trust in the interaction between users and new automated modes of road transport and mobility services in the transition from human-driven to automated vehicles.
3.	Safety and security of vehicle occupants in all circumstances even when the vehicle is driverless by helping to prevent dangerous and inconvenient situations, also when boarding/off-boarding.
4.	Strengthened cooperation between users, vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, researchers and other stakeholders to co-design vehicles with solutions that optimise the on-board experience.
5.	Better understanding of the benefits of new vehicle technologies and solutions in terms of on-board experience, inclusiveness and trust to enable wider user acceptability and hence contribute to the creation of future standards.
6.	Full exploitation of the new opportunities offered by automated vehicles to provide user- centric, accessible and inclusive mobility for all.
Scope: In the transition from human-driven to automated vehicles, optimising the on-board experience and overall satisfaction of users is paramount for high social buy-in and widespread adoption of CCAM-based mobility solutions. This can be achieved through the development, integration and validation of advanced vehicle technologies and solutions that serve to optimise the usability, perception and experience on-board and when boarding/off- boarding. Such solutions should be designed holistically by adopting a universal design approach from an inclusive, user-centric perspective. All users will demand vehicles that allow and facilitate relaxing, social or work-related activities within a space designed for health and well-being and that are responsive to individual needs (depending on gender, age, disability, size, weight etc.), while ensuring privacy for social interaction. Hence, a wide range of different user groups are expected to be involved early in the development phase to

have their specific needs understood, in order to develop technologies and solutions for individual and shared automated vehicles that meet the demands of all.
To achieve these objectives, it is expected that activities will focus on the development and validation of a range of new, advanced technologies and solutions that leverage the latest advances in technologies and know-how in terms of ensuring a seamless interaction between the vehicle and its occupants that are also fully aligned with safety requirements (and future standards), including at least the following aspects:
?	Perception-focused solutions and features (e.g. temperature, lighting, sound/acoustics, vibration, seating, posture), aimed at enhancing the sense of safety, privacy, and well- being while eliminating stress, including personalisation, addressing the specific needs of individuals from diverse user groups (e.g. elderly, disabled, tourists).
?	Alternative, flexible and automated interior configurations to better suit occupants? needs.
?	Solutions that further advance the state-of-the-art with respect to tackling motion sickness.
?	Adaptive systems that can also transfer preferred personal settings between vehicles to increase the user acceptability of shared vehicles.
?	New mobility services also for users with special needs (e.g. elderly and disabled), which take into account the heterogeneous requirements and preferences of different target groups.
?	Technologies to ensure the security of the occupants, which monitor inside and outside the vehicle to reduce the risk of its misuse and counteracting dangerous situations (e.g. assaults, vandalism, thefts, etc.).
It will be necessary, also based on feedback from user groups, to assess how the technologies and services developed benefit on-board experience and inclusiveness.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-02," Generation of scenarios for development, training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems (CCAM Partnership)",9/5/2023,RIA,5/4/2023,,,Around 20.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
1.	Improved validation of CCAM systems enabled by real and synthetic test scenarios, with the widest possible coverage of traffic situations CCAM systems can encounter on European roads.
2.	Efficient provision of relevant test scenarios in a permanently updated and therefore dynamic EU wide database.
3.	Accelerated AI development and training making use of the dynamic scenario database.

4.	Use of the most appropriate approaches (e.g. vehicle-based versus (quasi-)stationary sensor units) to record relevant traffic data, as a basis for the derivation of test scenarios, in different traffic environments according to extending ODDs.
5.	Commitment from key stakeholders to the validation methodology, the scenario database and its usage and to the provision of significant volumes of raw data and/or scenarios extracted from such data.
Scope: Higher levels of CCAM require validation methodologies making use of scenario- based physical and virtual testing, thereby complementing real-world test drives on public roads, audits and in-use reporting. Scenario-based testing is necessary as conventional testing and validation approaches would require driving hundreds of millions of test kilometres

before new CCAM systems or system updates can be deployed. The development of common scenario-based validation methodologies is the subject of HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-02278 and should be based on the results of the HEADSTART project279. To enable these common validation methodologies to be widely used, relevant test scenarios need to be provided. These scenarios can partly be defined based on expert knowledge, which, however, needs to be complemented by the extraction of test scenarios from real traffic data280, from collision data and in the future, from advanced traffic simulations. The aim of this call topic is to generate a wide range of test scenarios for the training, testing and validation of CCAM systems with a focus on urban and rural traffic, for which there is significantly less knowledge on relevant scenarios than for motorway driving.
To maximise the outcomes, proposed actions should demonstrate upfront commitment from key stakeholders to the validation methodologies, as developed and used in HEADSTART, in a project to be funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-02281, in L3Pilot and in Hi-Drive, either by providing significant volumes of raw data or by providing scenarios extracted from such data making use of the automated processing chain. Furthermore, stakeholders should dedicate resources to ensure that the scenarios are developed in a manner that maximises their utility also to other entities and their successful integration in their future (virtual) development and testing processes. Proposed actions are expected to share scenarios in an openly accessible EU wide database, which should be established by a project to be funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-02282.
Scenarios and other data shared by stakeholders and existing data made available by national and by other EU-funded projects can be complemented by new data recorded in this action, to provide a realistic set of scenarios with EU-wide coverage.
The proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:

1.	AI based tools to transform raw traffic data into reliable, plausibility-proofed data as well as tools for automatic scenario identification and extraction from that data, including the detection of edge cases - the relatively rare, but particularly challenging traffic situations.
2.	Generation of variations of scenarios (starting from those based on real traffic data and creating synthetic entries to the scenario database) with a focus on extending ODDs (including adverse weather conditions).
3.	Integration of the above in an automatic processing chain with standardised, open interfaces to enable the efficient and seamless use of data from different sources. The processing chain is expected to comply with the FAIR principles, should be agnostic to

sensor technologies, data providers and traffic environments, and it should provide for the data management and quality assurance through the whole process.
4.	Ensuring reliable merging of scenarios from different data sources (different projects, different vehicles and stationary units, different perspectives etc.).
5.	Feeding the resulting scenarios in an openly accessible dynamic scenario database, which can be used for the development, training, virtual testing and type approval validation of CCAM systems, and which should be connected to or integrate existing national databases as far as possible.
6.	Quality assurance of the database: Defining approaches and methods to handle uncertainty and the possibility of errors that might propagate in the assessment, including algorithms for their quantification.
7.	Demonstration, assessment of the potential and upscaling of (quasi-)stationary sensor units to record high quality big traffic data in various environments, as well as under various environmental conditions and to identify relevant scenarios making use of the processing chain. The focus of recording such data from a ?helicopter? perspective - as an alternative to the use of vehicle-based sensors - should be on the provision of suitable data in a cost-efficient way particularly in urban areas. This includes the fusion of data from different sensors. Upscaling requires amongst others the definition of hardware and software requirements for such measuring and recording systems. When recording traffic data in urban areas, proposed action should aim at:
?	high geographic coverage,
?	high seasonal coverage including adverse environmental conditions (e.g. extreme weather conditions) and their synchronized recording and
?	coverage of complex traffic environments including the interaction with other road users (e.g. pedestrians, bicyclists, users of personal mobility devices).
8.	Evaluating different approaches to identify relevant scenarios on rural roads based on the developed processing chain and on traffic data to be recorded on various types of rural roads. This includes the fusion of data from different sensors. When recording traffic data on rural roads, roads with low traffic density should be covered in addition to addressing the coverage issues above.
9.	Exploring the potential of complementing scenarios extracted from real traffic data with scenarios extracted from validated, highly detailed traffic simulations, including the use of AI to generate edge cases and other adversarial driving conditions in such simulations.
10.	Development of a mechanism for the continuous generation of updates of the dynamic scenario database, including an arrangement for the organisational set-up, governance and financial management of the required activities and resources.

The research will require due consideration of cyber security and both personal and non- personal data protection issues, including GDPR. The cyber security of the developed processing chain should be demonstrated for training, virtual testing and validation of CCAM systems.
Proposed actions are expected to develop recommendations for harmonisation and standardisation and to feed into on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-03, Infrastructure-enabled solutions for improving the continuity or extension of Operational Design Domains (ODDs) (CCAM Partnership),9/5/2023,IA,5/4/2023,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

1.	Infrastructure-enabled solutions improving the continuity of or extending the Operational Design Domains (ODDs).
2.	System, data and service architectures for Digital Twins 283 for road transport infrastructure developed and feasibility proven.
3.	Input to standardisation, also legal, trust and data security aspects as well as business and governance models (including organisational processes and right of use of data) for Digital Twins.
4.	Advanced cooperation of CCAM actors in a robust and functionally safe manner for reasons of ODD continuity/extension, enhancing the readiness of CCAM services and their future extendibility.
Scope: Operational Design Domains (ODDs) of automated vehicle functions are currently limited (e.g. motorways up to 60 km/h). Infrastructure-enabled or -supported solutions can help automated vehicles to overcome the limitation and fragmentation of ODDs. Several Horizon 2020 projects (e.g. INFRAMIX 284 , TransAID 285 , MAVEN 286 ) have delivered promising concepts on how infrastructure and vehicles can work together. Projects addressing the first Horizon Europe calls of the CCAM Partnership (most notably HORIZON-CL5-2021- D6-01-03 287 and HORIZON-CL5-2022-D6-01-01 288 ) are expected to expand on this promising ground 289. Directions for improving the continuity of or extending the ODDs comprise mechanisms such as extended perception and decision-making delegation, supporting the real time knowledge about conditions in the ?electronic horizon?, the centimetric accuracy of the positioning signal, the ability of CCAM enabled vehicles to navigate through road works and incident sites.
Digital Twins can improve the real-time availability of information, especially on information that stems from road authorities and road operators. Digital Twins also serve as a data source for prescriptive analytics and simulation environments, in order to improve the efficiency of (virtual) testing and pro-active traffic management. Moreover, Digital Twins play an important role for asset management. The scope includes technology requirements, coherence with proven physical and digital infrastructure support concepts, using Digital Twins for true redundancy and operation in different weather conditions.
As close cross-sectoral collaboration will be necessary, social innovation 290 should be considered to support the actions under this topic, thereby empowering different stakeholders and communities in the design, development and implementation of innovative ideas that are in line with societal needs.
Proposed actions for this topic are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Improve the availability of real-time information beyond the reach of vehicle on-board sensors by developing and demonstrating system, data and service architectures for Digital Twins for road transport infrastructure.
?	Remove the discontinuity of the GNSS positioning signal in challenging road environments such as urban canyons and canopies, tunnels, mountainous areas and northern latitudes. Actions should develop approaches to improve the robustness and reliability of the positioning information by local positioning services, landmarks, modules, new procedures and redundancy processes etc.
?	Develop novel solutions for the management of and navigation through road works and incident sites for CCAM enabled vehicles, making such high-risk zones much safer for road users (including vulnerable road users), but also for road workers and rescue organisation personnel. Advancing CCAM from information only to services with automated actions requires cooperation in higher classes (?agreement seeking? according to SAE J 3216291). Safe and secure communication, transfer learning, distributed data processing as well as tools and enablers for improving the vehicles? capabilities of coping with infrastructure imperfections (such as sub-standard infrastructure maintenance) are expected to be addressed. Furthermore, harmonised local traffic management measures at road works and incident sites to support their safe navigation should also be addressed.
Proposed actions should advance the infrastructure-enabled solutions for ODD continuity and/or extension to TRL 6/7 on the way towards (pre-)deployment as an important contribution to large-scale demonstration actions292. EU-wide/global harmonisation is key in this action, enabling broad uptake of services in the common single market and paving the way towards coordinated deployment of necessary infrastructure support for CCAM. Potential needs for standardisation or input for future regulatory action should be identified. Proposed actions should build on NAP (National Access Points) and a Common European Mobility Dataspace to ensure alignment with existing framework  In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-04," Integrating European diversity in the design, development and implementation of CCAM solutions to support mobility equity (CCAM Partnership)",9/5/2023,RIA,5/4/2023,,,3.00 to 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
1.	Increased knowledge about the influence of geographical and cultural dimensions on the societal acceptability, uptake and use of CCAM.
2.		Integration of geographical and cultural factors in the planning, design, development and implementation of CCAM solutions by CCAM developers and implementers (including decision-makers).
3.	A strategy to support the fair deployment of CCAM systems and services, adapted to local contexts and cultures, leading to enhanced acceptability and willingness to use CCAM in Europe, thereby contributing to CCAM?s expected societal benefits.

4.	Increased transferability of solutions, experiences, knowledge and lessons learnt between European cities, regions and projects that integrate geographical and cultural diversities in the development and deployment of CCAM.
Scope: Research on the societal implications and deployment of CCAM systems and services has mostly been ?geography- and culture-agnostic?, focusing instead on mobility behaviours at demographic level and prioritising factors like age and gender. However, European countries encompass multiple cultures, historical heritage, administrative structures, and public policy approaches (e.g. on climate change, digitalisation, and road safety) which may influence the uptake and use of CCAM. The range of cultural, geographical and policy diversities need to be integrated into the design, development and deployment of CCAM solutions. Such diversities can include infrastructure (certain regions have dedicated lanes for alternative mobility solutions, strong bike cultures), specific geographical dispositions (mountains, harsh weather conditions leading to car-captivity or a centralisation of mobility services), or cultural norms and working conditions (e.g. remote working or diverging innovation-friendly or privacy-centric cultures). Furthermore, there are also regional regulatory, policy and governance structures that influence the development and implementation of CCAM or other innovative services.
Adapting to and building on these European differences and similarities will ensure a more tailored, resilient and sustainable match between CCAM solutions, people and societal needs, thereby leading to higher public buy-in and societal benefits. R&I actions will therefore provide a geographical and cultural understanding of CCAM uptake and use, with the aim of contributing to a more integrated, diverse and people centric approach to the design, development and implementation of CCAM supporting mobility equity. Intersecting social factors, such as gender, age, social origin and income level should nevertheless be taken into account, where relevant.
The proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:

1.	Evaluate how cultural and regional particularities have led to different transport infrastructure, societal settings, travel needs and behaviours.
2.	Develop methodologies that take into account the impact of cultural and regional diversities on attitudes, demand, uptake, and implementation of CCAM solutions, early in the design and development phase. In particular, these methodologies should combine this range of diversities and be based on:
?	Aggregation of results from existing studies and pilots that have investigated isolated diversity aspects in automated mobility contexts.
?	A systems perspective, with specific attention on the impact of CCAM on digital equity (e.g. methods for service payment and information, access to CCAM services, avoiding the negative equity effects of CCAM services without a human driver).

3.	Develop principles, criteria and recommendations for the developers and implementers of CCAM systems and services (including local decision-makers and policy makers) that foster the integration of geographical and cultural factors in the planning, design, development and implementation of CCAM through proactive and corrective measures.
4.	Propose indicators and approaches to enable a fair integration of cultural and regional factors in CCAM impact evaluation frameworks to better reflect the need for CCAM to support mobility equity.
5.	Develop mechanisms to transfer knowledge, e.g. maps, matrices or other instruments, to capture patterns and recurring typologies of settlements, infrastructure and travel indicators in Europe to foster dissemination of people-centric and sustainable CCAM solutions. Include documentation of lessons learnt and approaches for an iterative and long-term evolution and update of the mechanism (until 2030).
6.	Demonstrate the developed recommendations and the knowledge transfer mechanism by applying them in at least four pilot activities for CCAM systems and/or services. The majority of pilots should be about shared services and should cover passenger and goods mobility, although a primary focus on either people or goods mobility is possible. The pilots can be local, regional or national but are expected to represent cultural and geographical diversity in at least four European countries.

HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-05," CCAM effects on jobs and education, plans for skills that match the CCAM development, and prerequisites for employment growth (CCAM Partnership)",9/5/2023,RIA,5/4/2023,,,Around 2.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

1.	Improved understanding of the short-, medium- and long-term employment effects (e.g. working conditions, shifts in responsibilities, future roles and driver?s skills depreciation) and wider socio-economic effects (income segregation, geographic dispersion, availability of entry level jobs) resulting from CCAM deployment, taking into account the full range of professions associated with CCAM services for the movement of people and goods. This includes insight on the demand of new and updated skills, as well as plans to develop and enhance these skills in order to realise new opportunities and future needs arising from CCAM deployment.
2.	High awareness within the stakeholder community about the effects of CCAM on jobs, along the entire CCAM value chain, and recommendations on how to address those effects.
3.	Prerequisites for job creation and job growth through strategies that aim to boost innovation capabilities and develop competitive CCAM solutions and associated businesses.
4.	Support the development of educational plans and activities (e.g. for curricula, Lifelong learning initiatives) as well as reskilling efforts to develop human capital in innovative mobility systems and services through education and training, thereby realising the benefits of a large deployment of CCAM solutions.

Scope: In order to make the socio-economic transition to CCAM fair for all, it is important to anticipate and mitigate potential job losses and job relocations due to CCAM deployment (including shared services) by ensuring that necessary skills are available and up scaled across a wide range of fields (along the entire CCAM value chain, from mobility operators, IT staff, drivers and non-drivers, to administration and management in transport). While concerns and future needs regarding the impact of automation on the transport sector have been identified and investigated294,295, the potential for CCAM solutions to lead to job creation and job growth remains strong.
H2020 projects296 and studies297 have investigated the socio-economic impacts of automation across different transport modes (air, rail, road, waterborne) in order to provide policy recommendations that keep pace of this rapidly developing mobility transition.
Building upon the findings of these projects, the proposed action will aim to further anticipate and mitigate the impacts and rebound effects on jobs due to the deployment of road based CCAM systems and services, as well as boost innovation capabilities through the availability and upscaling of CCAM-specific professional skills. A wide range of professions and fields has to be considered. In addition, proposed actions should raise the awareness of the stakeholder community to better understand and anticipate upcoming socio-economic needs and requirements (especially in terms of employment opportunities and skills) and provide support through proactive planning.
The proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:

?	Develop a roadmap to support the socio-economic transition to CCAM and provide prerequisites for job growth, strengthened innovation capabilities, and short- and long- term demands for skills. Future spatial mismatches in labour demand identified by existing studies298 should be taken into account. This roadmap should consider a wide range of CCAM-related professions, especially service related, and highlight any particularities between the transport of persons and of goods.
?	Define and assess how expectations for job growth enabled by CCAM development and deployment can be achieved. Identify mechanisms and options to enhance innovation capabilities to develop competitive solutions. Social innovation299 is encouraged.
?	Analyse socio-economic and employment effects of CCAM across the full value-chain, such as income segregation, geographic dispersion, workforce overcapacity/shortages, considering various penetration degrees of mobility solutions with automation levels 3-5, taking into account:
?	Different operations in the transportation of people and freight.
?	Aspects induced by new emerging business models such as sharing schemes, e- commerce.
?	The role of road transport as an entry point into work-life and the effect of CCAM on the availability of entry-level jobs.
?	Identify and assess short to long-term demands for updated skills (as well as skills and gender gaps) and enhanced knowledge regarding the full range of CCAM-related professions along its entire value chain, both for the mobility of persons and delivery of goods. This goes beyond jobs directly involved with vehicles (manufacturing, driving and operating) and should also include services (e.g. boarding assistance at travel end- points such as hospitals). This should include the development of educational plans and trainings300.
?	Design schemes for the development and enhancement of skills to support future CCAM jobs and innovations. This is to be done throughout educational chains by looking at different use cases, paying particular attention to potential mismatches in skills and spatial demand and supply. Consider at least three use-cases for groups of people that are directly or indirectly involved in the provision of CCAM services. A variety of angles should be covered, including young persons, gender, private and public sector, passenger mobility and freight.

?	Better understanding of local authorities? ability to influence greener choices of delivery and return options by consumers.
?	Recommendations proposed to local authorities and the EU on the impact of relevant policy levers and possible regulations to influence greener choices of delivery and return options.
Scope: To support changing retailers and customers? behaviours towards zero-emission freight delivery and return choices, the research actions will have to develop co-created actions able to increase transparency and consumers? awareness of greenhouse gas emissions and other impacts (considering also socio-economic ones) of e-commerce, deliveries and returns.

?	Better definition of the operational automation requirements for seamless multimodal automatic freight transport.

Scope: Automated vehicles, rolling stock and vessels, as well as related transhipment automated processes, are developed independently within the various transport modes and sectors. This creates gaps and disconnections in the actual use within the logistics operations, missing concrete new operational models and opportunities for end-to-end logistics, which may support adoption and contributing to system integration and decarbonisation.

Automation will change the way goods flow across all modes (possibly encouraging modal shifts to coastal shipping modes/smaller vessel fleets, inland waterways transport, railway transport, or alternative road transport usages) and is not well explored in terms of opportunities for the logistics supply chains and enabling increased usage of vehicles and infrastructures. A high level of operational automation can be reached in terminals and hubs (e.g. node-to-node operations undertaken in inland hubs, multimodal depots, logistics terminals, freight consolidation facilities), which offer controlled environments and repeatable processes but also in the operational domain of processes occurring in those places.
To ensure operational efficiency and support multimodal transport, proposals should address all the following points:
?	Identify gaps in automated transport technologies and logistics operations between modes and hubs.
?	Assess benefits of autonomous vehicles, rolling stock and vessels to multimodal logistics and the role/benefits of seamless multimodal automatic cargo transport across transport modes (rail, road, waterborne, aviation, alternative innovative modes of transport).
?	Investigate the requirements and define concrete benefits of seamless and automated logistics operations, particularly in multimodal terminals and hubs, linking e.g. rail, road and inland waterways with a focus on intra-European freight flows. Consider interoperability and cybersecurity issues.
?	With the support of e.g. machine learning, digital twins, robotic process automation and AI, and using historical operational data, compare and demonstrate (through simulation) benefits of operational automation to current standard flows and operations in all modes. Synergies for rail will need to be sought with the EU-Rail Programme projects implementing the Flagship Areas 1, 2 and Destination 5306.
?	Design, analyse and evaluate business and governance models as well as organisational change issues and incentives to reduce the investment costs and support the implementation of automated solutions for logistics and multimodal freight transport.
?	Develop and propose recommendations for possible regulatory and policy actions supporting the adoption of automated solutions for logistics and multimodal freight transport.

?	Establish a comprehensive set of harmonised GHG emission factors, for transport and logistics operations;
?	Explore synergies and establish horizontal cooperation among various organisational structures developing GHG emission factors for transport and logistics.
Scope: Proposals should develop a comprehensive set of harmonised emission factors for the transport sector (freight and passenger), covering GHG emissions (CO2 equivalent) of transport and logistics operations. Proposals should address values for the entire transport/logistics chain and take up the full energy lifecycle (Well-To-Wheel/Wake).


307	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf

Emission factors that relate the amount of GHG emission to the unit of energy consumed (for an energy-based calculation), or to the amount of GHG activity (for an activity-based calculation) are the basis of any GHG calculation. The increased efforts for measuring effects of climate change in various segments of the transport sector resulted in a range of values developed within the organisational structures of different transport modes, research entities and countries. Some of this work led to legitimate testing and development of the methodologies for the calculation and use of emission factors, or the generation of values that represent fuel specifications for given applications. However, much of it has merely resulted in a proliferation of apparently similar values creating confusion in the marketplace and bearing the risk of selection of sources/values purely on the basis of what is beneficial to the individual entity rather than what is correct.
This problem becomes more important in conjunction with the development of a wide set of technical solutions combating climate change, particularly the new and increasingly complex zero and low carbon energy mixes, including e- and biofuels. These solutions are deployed in the market very often with the support of dedicated financial mechanisms and programs, based on the estimated GHG emission reduction associated with the specific fuel technologies. Not only is it important for the climate impact that the emission calculations are ?correct?308, but when dealing with large amounts of transport energy even a small difference over an emission factor value can lead to a significant difference in the associated financial transaction. Without an agreed and validated set of default emission factors for a wide range of the most common energy sources and a mechanism whereby legitimate variations or new energy carriers can be regularly updated, many actions based on calculating GHG emission reduction can be considered to be a risk of conflict and associated legal dispute.
Proposals will have to address all of the following points:

?	Review the existing emission factors derived from the key global sources, duly reflecting the scientific state of the art and ensuring the coverage of new and conventional fuels.
?	Perform the gap analysis and develop emission factors for categories not yet covered, both for upstream and downstream emissions, taking into due consideration new production pathways, and addressing in particular the uncertainty and variation in the well to tank factors to be applied to the new fuels.
?	Establish a clearer set of rules regarding:
1.	Methodology ? to ensure that the basis and legitimate use of the two fundamental methodology types (consequential and attributional) are properly understood and applied appropriately.
2.	Boundaries of calculation ? to ensure that boundaries are not accidentally or deliberately set in order to favour particular outcomes.


308	There may be no such thing as a 100% correct value, but it is essential there is a consensus and linked convention based around values within an agreed, small uncertainty threshold.

3.	Common sets of fuel / energy specifications ? to ensure that data labels and associated values are truly aligned between sources.
4.	Assumptions about input parameters that can result in variations in output values based on local circumstances for specific production.
5.	The basis for new energy carriers to be calculated quickly and consistently in order to avoid delaying the deployment of new, beneficial solutions.
Establish a simple guidance to the transport sector as to which emission factors are the agreed defaults, and why; under what circumstances an alternative can legitimately be used.
The project?s main governance (e.g. Steering Group, Advisory Board) is expected to provide for direct involvement of all relevant stakeholders, as well as relevant European Commission services.
The proposal should build on the existing and emerging EU regulatory frameworks (including Commission?s proposal for the Fit-for-55 package and the new initiative on harmonised measurement of transport and logistics emissions ? ?CountEmissions EU?), GHG emissions accounting standardisation activities (such as the future ISO standard 14083) and other relevant initiatives and projects. Given that emission factors are applied in a global transport market, efforts need to be made to ensure that internationally relevant bodies such as IMO or ICAO are involved alongside prominent European stakeholders.",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-09, Climate resilient and safe maritime ports,9/5/2023,IA,5/4/2023,,,Around 7.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to ALL of the following outcomes (with a clear baseline for each use case):
?	Ensure resilience of infrastructure of a) seaports, b) connected inland waterways infrastructure c) connected hinterland land infrastructure, to extreme weather events by assuring at least 80% operability during the disruptions.
?	Contribute with at least 20% increase in modal shift of port hinterland connections towards zero- and low-emission transport systems.
?	Ensure safe port access and port operations by avoiding extra accidents as a consequence of disruptions caused by a changing climate.
?	Minimise environmental impact (e.g. emissions, soil/water pollution, degradation of ecosystems and fragmentation of habitats and biodiversity loss, as foreseen in the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 309 ) during construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning of the infrastructure by going beyond the EU environmental legislation.
?	Present guidelines describing measures (structural, operational and institutional) to address climate risks and hazards, and provide guidance on how to screen and evaluate options.
Scope: Research is needed in order to limit transport infrastructure vulnerability to climate change and other natural or human caused disruptions. Making infrastructures more resilient to climate change should focus on improving the ability of the transport infrastructure network to withstand disruption, adapt to changing conditions under extreme circumstances while maintaining its performance. The goal is to strengthen infrastructure reliability, improve its performance under extreme circumstances thus increasing the resilience of the whole transport system.
Sea ports and waterways around the world are experiencing air and water temperature increases, rising sea levels, changes in seasonal precipitation and wind and wave conditions. Many are also seeing more frequent and severe extreme events such as storms, flash floods, prolonged heatwaves and droughts. Climate change represents a significant risk to business, operations, safety and infrastructure ? and hence to local, national and European economies.
Extreme weather events affect transport infrastructures and their management. Even if infrastructures are designed to cope with various stresses along their life, the increase of frequency and severity of extreme weather events will, increase their deterioration pace and increase possibility of accidents that may become more frequent due to adverse weather conditions. Sea ports and connected inland waterways are particularly exposed to extreme weather events and are very important for the local and global economy, since nearly 80% of world freight is transported by ship. Seaports of Europe are gateways to other continents. 74% of extra-EU goods are shipped through ports. They are also important for intra-European

309	https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1590574123338&uri=CELEX:52020DC0380

trade: 37% of the intra-EU freight traffic and 385 million passengers pass by ports every year. A 50% growth of cargo handled in EU ports is predicted by 2030310
Port and waterway operators need to take urgent action to strengthen resilience and adapt. As costal structures, seaports and connected inland waterways are exposed to storm surges and sea level rise and are vulnerable to flooding. Climate change is expected to have more severe impacts in northern Europe, where Europe?s top 20 cargo seaports are located. In total, 852 ports face the risk of inundation  in 2080 and the number of seaports to be exposed to inundation levels higher than 1m is projected to increase by 80% from 2030 to 2080. The number of ports that face the risk of inundation is expected to increase by more than 50% from 2030 to 2080. This trend is even stronger on the North Sea coast, where according to the GISCO database over 500 ports are located with traffic accounting for up to 15% of the world?s cargo transport (EUCC-D, 2013). In total, 852 important ports face the risk of inundation by the end of the century is 852311.
At the same time when focusing at a resilient and performing transport infrastructure, its environmental footprint, resource and material consumption and habitat fragmentation and biodiversity degradation should be reduced to a minimum. The goal is smart, green, sustainable, climate-resilient and biodiversity friendly infrastructure.
Proposals will develop and validate new solutions to increase resilience, efficiency, inter- modality and safety of the transport system, for passengers and freight.
Proposals will have to address all the following points:

?	Develop solutions for ensuring the performance and safety of a) seaports, b) connected inland waterways infrastructure c) connected hinterland land infrastructure, during periods of extreme weather events.
?	Develop strategies minimising capacity loss of infrastructures during disruptive events, securing infrastructure assets or delivering the necessary redundancy or adaptive capacity when at the same time avoiding over-designing, adopting an inappropriate or irreversible design, based on vulnerability analysis and risk assessment.
?	Demonstrate solutions to interconnect infrastructure health monitoring, traffic management and emergency management systems to support informed decision making during and after these events, also supporting possible redistribution of freight and passengers flows to complementary infrastructures. Solutions for rail to be harmonised with EU-Rail Programme projects implementing the Flagship Area 5312.

?	Build on innovative solutions for surveillance and prediction of climate change effects, such as the Destination Earth digital twins313, and for identification of infrastructure points particularly vulnerable to climate change. Proposals should develop cross-modal strategies to upgrade (including physical upgrade) existing infrastructures and reduce their vulnerability, while using sustainable materials and construction techniques.
?	Develop novel and improved governance models that enable cooperation across institutional, modal and national boundaries to cope with large-scale shocks and disruptions.
?	Develop standard procedures and methodologies to foster the implementation of measures (structural, operational, institutional and social) to address climate risks and hazards. Include at least three pilot demonstrations of the proposed solutions in operational environment (minimum at TRL7) for three seaports with connected inland waterways infrastructure on CEF corridors. The pilots should select the most effective measures and combinations of measures and determine how and when they can best be implemented over time as conditions change.
?	Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative impact of the proposed measures with a clear baseline for each pilot demonstration.
?	Innovative infrastructure solutions should contribute to lowering the environmental footprint, resources and material consumption. Exploring Nature-based solutions (NBS) is an opportunity for creating sustainable, climate-resilient European transport infrastructure in a cost-effective manner, while producing substantial social, economic, and environmental co-benefits. The goal is smart, green, sustainable and climate-resilient infrastructure, planned in a way that maximises positive impact on economic growth and minimises the negative impact on the environment and, significant and lasting degradation of ecosystems, fragmentation of habitats or loss of biodiversity, promoting environmentally friendly modes of transport and leading to the reduction of transport emissions.
If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries are expected to describe how the use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS are incorporated in the proposed solutions.
Proposals should also consider results from previous calls on infrastructure resilience 314 construction and sustainable construction and should uptake relevant EU guidance on development and management of European transport infrastructures",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-10," Better infrastructure safety on urban and secondary rural roads throughout a combination of adaptable monitoring and maintenance solutions	",9/5/2023,RIA,5/4/2023,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Research is expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:

?	Enhanced criteria catalogue for road safety assessment for urban and secondary roads with particular applicability for non-trunk roads and the safety impact on all ? including new ? types of users. Criteria can be mapped on to established safety-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) e.g. reduction of collisions, homogeneous driving speed, reduction of maintenance costs, etc. to provide measurable societal benefits.
?	Technology for the real-time generation and communication of infrastructure Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to safety, including those created/derived from vehicle sensor data

RESIST: https://trimis.ec.europa.eu/project/resilient-transport-infrastructure-extreme-events CLARITY: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/730355

?	Concepts for interaction of infrastructure elements in a digitalised ecosystem for road safety resulting in measurable benefits (reduced number of collisions, reduced maintenance costs, reduced time spent in congestions, monetary economic benefits, etc.).
Scope: Road infrastructure can be improved to decrease the risk of crashes and other incidents as well as crash severity. The benefits of this will be amplified in a connected transport system where automated or partially automated vehicles are supported by infrastructure features to perform as expected. In addition, road infrastructure can provide clear guidance towards desirable road user behaviour, which may lead to more predictable behaviour, and consequently to less crashes.
It is essential to understand how to upgrade the infrastructure network to make it compatible with all road users (e.g. powered two-wheelers are not considered as users for which urban infrastructures are usually designed) and in particular with automated vehicles at different levels of automation. The research should focus on urban and secondary rural networks as most of the resources for upgrading the road network is often devoted to primary networks (with specific attention to the Trans-European Road Network). For urban and secondary roads, resources are generally limited, and potential negative impact of roadworks on the surrounding territory is extremely relevant. Low-cost interventions with low negative impact need to be studied for these roads.
Advanced monitoring, warning and maintenance techniques need to be developed to guarantee a timely assessment of the operating conditions of road structures and furniture. Recent events have highlighted the importance of roadside safety devices monitoring, but also proper signs and marking, pavement and overall road structures (bridges, tunnels etc.).
The results of the research will enhance the safety level of the infrastructure by enabling a prompt reaction to potentially unsafe conditions and will enable to identify the infrastructures where connected, automated vehicles can travel under safe conditions.
Aspects to be addressed are expected to include:

?	Connection of infrastructure elements to the digitalised ecosystem, including but not limited to research on digital twins.
?	Identification of criteria to perform safety assessments of urban and secondary rural roads accounting also for new users (including but not limited to powered two-wheelers, e-bikes etc.) and to identify cost effective upgrade solutions.
?	Further development of infrastructure measures to elicit desired road user behaviour.
?	Pilot testing of selected interventions in at least three sites.
In addition, actions should address at least three out of the following aspects:

?	Integration of safety and V2I issues in asset management to ensure that the infrastructure is always capable to provide the minimum required level of performance to provide safe travel conditions for automated vehicles (ISAD concept).
?	Development of new technology for monitoring and communicating in real time infrastructure distress conditions and deterioration. This should include malfunctioning and post impact warning for road equipment and Infrastructure.
?	Development of onsite data storage and communication systems (e.g. RFID) capable to provide in real time details on the properties of the road equipment relevant to road safety.
?	Use of data from connected probe vehicles to detect safety relevant conditions and collect maintenance indicators.
?	Development of new maintenance techniques for road equipment with low negative impact on the surroundings (including but not limited to roadside safety features, signs and marking, lighting).
Actions should be based on the results of previous EU projects",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-11, Aviation safety - Uncertainty quantification for safety and risk management,9/5/2023,IA,5/4/2023,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results should focus to the quantification of uncertainty (UQ) in all aspects of the design, manufacturing and operations for achieving high level of safety and a better management of risks. Project results are expected to contribute to at least three (or more) of the following expected outcomes:
?	UQ for modelling/simulation of design, manufacturing and integration processes.
?	UQ for operational aspects.
?	UQ for virtual certification.
?	Big data processing and data science for safety intelligence and risk management, including both structured and unstructured (text-based) data.
?	Development of UQ (as open as possible) mathematical libraries and management Tools (e.g. tolerancing, kriging, higher order reliability methods).
?	Validation campaigns in challenging test cases.
Scope: Uncertainties are always present due to limited manufacturing precision and variable operating conditions and life cycle events. Integrating these uncertainties into the design process of aircraft, aircraft engines and systems is a key element to reduce program risk and to ensure safe and economic operation.
Uncertainty is an upper bound between the estimate of aircraft characteristics and performance at a certain stage of its development and characteristics of the aircraft once in service. As such, the full lifecycle of aviation systems should be taken into account, including uncertainties occurring during manufacturing operations. This uncertainty can be the consequence of the quality of the means used during the development phase to estimate these characteristics and an inaccurate knowledge of the actual status of the aircraft, and appropriate tolerancing in the design phase. The planning and design of the current and future aviation system requires an advanced model of the interactive aviation operational system, not just of pilot or aircraft-centric operations.
Evaluation of uncertainties associated to each measurement should be the result of a detailed and justified methodology, fully taking account of the role of human factors or human agents within the aviation socio-technical system. Treatment of uncertainties enables a rigorous management of performance engagements and associated risks assessment. Traditional safety margin approaches will be replaced by engineering procedures based on sound data analysis using both mathematical modelling and knowledge engineering appropriate to both structured and unstructured (text-based) data.
As appropriate, safety risk assessment should be addressed in cooperation with EASA, notably with regard to big data processing on safety intelligence",
HORIZON-CL5-2023-D6-01-12, New ways of reducing serious injuries and the long-term consequences of road crashes,9/5/2023,RIA,5/4/2023,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Research results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:

?	Validated mechanisms of personal injuries leading to significant long-term consequences, for all road users (pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcycle riders, car and bus drivers and occupants, etc.).
?	Established system for classification of long-term injuries, including methods for follow- up of personal injuries for the required time after a crash.
?	Validated tools and methods for the assessment of injuries leading to long-term consequences, such as upgraded virtual human body models.
?	Preconditions to develop policy, regulatory, and standard requirements for the purpose of reducing serious injuries, in particular those with long-term consequences.
?	A general upgrade in protection for all road users through safe and robust countermeasures and solutions.
Scope: In addition to fatal and near-fatal injuries, personal injuries with long-term consequences continue to pose a threat to personal mobility. Particularly pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcycle riders, as well as users of new mobility devices, have a high risk to sustain personal injuries with long-term outcomes, such as brain and neck injuries. In cars, despite new collision mitigation systems, low and medium severity collisions may still cause

similar permanent neurological disorders to occupants. Long-term injuries to both the upper and lower extremities are further examples, occurring among all road user types. As of today, neither any standardized nor any accepted method exists for the evaluation of solutions to reduce long-term outcomes. In addition, there is a need to include more aspects of human variability like age, sex, weight, and stature, with particular focus on long-term disability.
Several research areas, also social sciences, are required for the sake of understanding and reducing the long-term consequences fully. Cognitive capabilities could for example be impaired by physical head trauma, and there is at the same time a need for more knowledge of psychiatric impairment related to posttraumatic stress or reduced quality of life. In other words, cognitive issues and depression have to be fully recognized as potential long-term consequences of road crashes.
More research is needed to establish a relevant system for classification of long-term or permanent disability that can be used for the development and design of future protective solutions as well as policies and requirements. There is a strong need for refined knowledge of the relations between initial injury and long-term consequences of personal injury, which will demand new in-depth crash data for the reconstruction of collisions combined with long- term injury follow-up. New models for measuring long-term consequences will need a lot of real-world data to become validated. In-depth analysis of data from hospitalized patients will in this perspective also continue to be needed as well as efficient means to follow up on psychiatric impairment measurable. Hence, new efforts in accident research are required, as well as the most related social sciences (economics and psychology), further to research in biomechanics, vehicle crashworthiness, and other aspects of crash dynamics. New technologies open possibilities for gathering new types of data with higher levels of detail.
Virtual testing tools are crucial for new more efficient evaluation methods, and accordingly further development of human body models (HBM) is particularly important. The effectiveness of new systems should for instance be assessed in a wide range of crash load cases, which the current test dummies cannot support, and another possibility with the use of virtual HBM will be to evaluate integrated and adaptive safety at a significantly higher level of detail. The potential of HBM to be usable for the evaluation of long-term injuries in product development is strong and will be supported by further multidisciplinary research. Research is also needed to assess any limitations in this respect and, if applicable, examine how best to complement HBM with Anthropomorphic Test Devices and physical tools.
Virtual methods with HBM should not only be developed further for passenger car safety, but for the purpose of assessing personal protection equipment, forgiving road infrastructure (including road surfaces), and the protection of motorcycle, moped and bicycle riders, as well as pedestrians and users of new micro-mobility devices against long-term injuries. Virtual HBM need to reflect human variability, and there is a particular need to focus attention on children in all different road user roles, e.g. preteens in passenger vehicles who normally are not seated in child seats, yet often too small to be fully protected by current vehicle integrated safety systems.

New and upgraded vehicle interiors (including non-conventional seating and new interior features) of highly automated passenger cars, shuttle buses (including minibuses), and other driverless passenger vehicles, will play an important role in the efforts to raise the road safety level further regarding passenger vehicles. Persons who are standing, for instance passengers in public transport, should also be included. Market drivers (e.g. increased automation, comfort, and infotainment) will be reinforced with safety-intended development strategies when supported by relevant research and policies regarding long-term consequences.
Research within this field is expected to recommend upgrades to concerned policies, regulatory requirements, and standards. For this reason, international cooperation is recommended.
Findings, knowledge, and experience are encouraged to be shared with other fields, such as certain sport, recreation, and work activities, as well as with other transport modes, which may have similar issues regarding personal injuries with long-term consequences as road traffic, although a different incidence.
Actions should take into account the results of previous EU research projects in that domain (e.g. Seniors, VIRTUAL, SafetyCube).
Integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) and international cooperation with partners from the US and/or Australia is encouraged",

?	Higher visibility, political and strategic relevance of the transport sector and of the EU policy in the field;
?	Enhanced dissemination, communication and valorisation of transport R&I objectives, perspectives, strategies and results;
?	More effective links and exchanges between research and innovation stakeholders and policy makers, to support the development and deployment of innovative solutions in Europe;

Proposals are expected to demonstrate the financial and organisational support of the national authorities' and a preliminary economic plan covering the additional funding needs. In order to ensure high political and strategic relevance, preference will be given to proposals involving Member States holding the Presidency of the European Union in year 2025, 2026 or 2027.

politics, the industry and the research community, in response to Europe?s social needs and expectations.
In collaboration with the relevant actors, such as the European Commission services, the different European Technology Platforms (ERTRAC for road, ERRAC for rail, WATERBORNE TP for waterborne, ALICE for logistics and ACARE for aeronautics and ECTP for construction), the Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR), the European Transport Research Alliance (ETRA), relevant transport-related European partnerships, such as 2ZERO, CCAM, EU-Rail, ZEWT and Clean Aviation and the previous TRA conference organisers in order to maintain continuity, the action will define the overall planning of the conference, structure the technical and political sessions of the event, contribute to select the appropriate location for the venue and offer operational IT tools for the registration of participants, the handling of speakers? contributions, contribute to the organisation of logistics, etc. Support to the organisation of demonstration activities should also be foreseen.

?	A competition for senior researchers in the field of innovative transport concepts based on results from EU-funded projects only.
The organisation of these awards should ensure high-quality competition and very good media coverage before, during and after the TRA conference, in line with previous editions (TRA Visions). The competition is expected to give particular attention to gender issues.",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-01," Centralised, reliable, cyber-secure & upgradable in- vehicle electronic control architectures for CCAM connected to the cloud-edge continuum (CCAM Partnership)",9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	New, centralised, reliable, cyber-secure and upgradable in-vehicle electronic control architectures for CCAM based on the application of co-designed hardware, software and big or smart data flows in combination with over-the-air updates.
?	Widespread deployment of level 4 automation in road vehicles by expanding the Operational Design Domains (ODDs) of the control system towards higher complexity (city traffic, adverse weather conditions etc.) or greater scale.
?	Safe operation of Connected and Automated Driving (CAD) functions e.g. regarding Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) and ODD transitions through system agility, experience- based decision making and access to cloud intelligence.
?		Paradigm shift from human-based and component-supported vehicle control to a more integrated, resource efficient and reliable system for the control of CCAM systems.
?	Strengthened cooperation of European OEMs and suppliers to co-design a standard cyber secure electronic architecture layout with harmonised interfaces.
Scope: Since current on-board electronic systems are assembled from various controllers in a piecemeal fashion, they are not suitable for the complex, combined performance requirements of advanced levels of CCAM applications in terms of bandwidths, latency, flexibility, fail safety and cyber security. Therefore, a complete redesign of the in-vehicle control architecture is needed, combining innovations at hardware, software and data levels in the vehicle and in connection with distributed intelligence in the edge-cloud continuity. It should build on a centralised e.g. zonal or domain-based layout using distributed high-performance computing for connecting sensing and actuation systems with software updates over the air, big data flows and AI at the edge, resulting in a novel and upgradable electronic in-vehicle control scheme for safe and efficient automated driving functions and tele-operations.
Important building blocks for the in-vehicle control architecture include sensors and sensor data fusion for environment perception with AI ?at the edge?, using on-board high- performance computers and generic hard- and software including cyber secure components.
At the same time, the new control architecture and its context aware building blocks are expected to enable the following:
?	reliable, low-latency and high-bandwidth data communication for automated driving systems control to safeguard against cyber-attacks, malfunctions and malicious interactions.
?	systemic functionality gains in upgradability, efficiency, modularity, compatibility, scalability, fail-operation, reliability and redundancy.
?	definition of safety and security targets, open-source standard layouts and harmonised validation methods.

In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on ?Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility? (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on results to the European Partnership ?Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility? (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-02, Scenario-based safety assurance of CCAM and related HMI in a dynamically evolving transport system (CCAM Partnership),9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,Around 14.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
1.	Safe scaling up of the deployment of CCAM systems for all levels of automation, including systems that for part of the driving phases rely on human-machine interaction.
2.	Assurance of vehicle safety despite system changes, e.g., due to software updates and data exchanges between vehicles and the infrastructure.
3.	Facilitating the introduction of fast developing technological innovations in the CCAM system?s functionality, such as AI.
Scope: To ensure the safety of CCAM, it is essential that vehicles are not only safe during the (first) type approval, but also during their complete lifetime in a fast-changing road transport system. Changes can result from the evolution of the CCAM system itself, for example, as a

result of increasing connectivity using V2X communication, the use of AI-based systems, and OTA (over-the-air) software updates. The traffic system, in which CCAM systems are being deployed, is changing at a rapid pace as well, with an increased market share of vehicles with higher levels of automation, new (personal) mobility devices and autonomous mobility robots (e.g., for package delivery).
At the same time, the way CCAM systems interact with humans in traffic is changing. Until full automation in transport is reached, the human driver will keep on playing an essential role. Also, the interaction with other road users will change, supported by technologies that allow a CCAM system to communicate its intentions to other road users.
As a consequence of these innovations and developments, the safe deployment of CCAM systems needs an extension of the safety validation procedures and certification schemes, taking advanced human-machine interaction and a continuous in-service monitoring approach into account. Due to the many different scenarios and variations that can occur realistically and that consequently need to be tested, it should be possible that a large part of the assessment is performed in a virtual simulation environment.
The proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:

1.	Developing a validation methodology for scenario-based safety assurance of AI-based CCAM functions. Trustworthiness of the AI-algorithms depends on how well the system responds to scenarios in its Operational Design Domain (ODD) ? specificity and how it responds in case it ends-up outside its ODD ? robustness. Consequently, methods need to be developed on the use of scenarios to describe the ODD of AI-based systems.
2.	Connectivity. Developing validation procedures for CCAM systems that rely on V2X for safety-critical functions i.e., the inclusion of the connectivity context. Ensuring aspects of reliability, trustworthiness and cyber-security with respect to V2X is essential. The approach to V2X connectivity is technology neutral.
3.	Continuous Safety Assurance approach. Developing an approach for a continuous safety validation methodology, to monitor the safety state of deployed CCAM systems in operation (real traffic) during its service life, following type approval. Performance metrics for the reliability of the monitored data, including cyber-security aspects, and indicators for the safety state should be proposed. Also needed is the development of requirements for the monitoring system for use in future standardisation, regarding the exchange of data and safety performance indicators with service organisations and authorities.
4.	Validating the virtual approach. Developing tools that ensure the relevant degree of detail and the appropriate representation of other road users? behaviour (incl. Vulnerable Road Users such as pedestrians and/or bicyclists) in virtual scenario-based testing. This includes methods to deal with perception, localisation, and world modelling errors in the validation procedures.

5.	Human Machine Interaction. Developing a safety assurance methodology that incorporates the assessment of Human Machine Interaction (both driver-vehicle and vehicle-road user) concepts for higher levels of automation (conformity checks as well as test set-ups with suitable metrics) ensuring safe communication between driver and vehicle and between vehicle and other road users, making Human Machine Interaction inclusive (i.e. in terms of age, mental and physical ability, cultural aspects, etc.).
Proposed actions are expected to develop recommendations for harmonisation and standardisation and to feed into on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.
Actions should be based on the outcomes of previous methodologies developed in HEADSTART318, as well as research funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-02319.
Upcoming CCAM projects, in particular in the area of large-scale demonstrations, validation, digital infrastructure and key enabling technologies should be taken into account to ensure compatibility.

1.	System approach towards traffic management that integrates the operations and needs of a wide range of road network users (vehicle drivers, passengers and different kinds of VRUs) traffic management centres and public authorities as well as service providers, (public transport/commercial/logistics fleet managers, infrastructure industry) within the mobility ecosystem.
2.	Safer, more efficient and sustainable traffic management through the orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic320 within the CCAM ecosystem.
3.	Proven orchestration schemes in traffic management for operations of all types of vehicles and the different CCAM systems in real-time CCAM traffic conditions in urban and/or motorway environments.
4.	Governance and operational models that allow for better cooperation and collaboration of all relevant actors in the orchestration of traffic management through new mobility management for all modes and road types.
5.	Mobility management tools to seamlessly integrate CCAM systems and services including fleets of vehicles, public transport, logistics operations, demand management needs as well as governance and business models into the transport system.
6.	Strategic transport planning methods for all modes in the CCAM ecosystem including individual as well as public transport.
Scope: The aim is to advance on the orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic by building on, linking and integrating the following streams of research results and innovation challenges321:
1.	Smart routing and interactive traffic management using connectivity and C-ITS for the orchestration of heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic within the CCAM ecosystem322.
2.	Solutions for ensuring the safety and efficiency of early CCAM deployment in the interaction of drivers, riders, passengers, traffic participants and automated systems performing driving tasks in mixed traffic323.
3.	Coherent approach towards managing fleets from an overall system perspective in real- life urban demonstrations of CCAM via testing and demonstrations in large sets of traffic environments with an emphasis on different fleets, i.e. groups of vehicles (including e.g. public transport/commercial/logistics fleets, fleets operated by public or private transport operators) that are typically controlled/supervised/managed by heterogeneous actors324.
4.	New governance and operational models facilitating the orchestration schemes of traffic management that are inclusive towards all heterogeneous actors in traffic management325.
Proposed actions will develop and demonstrate an orchestration scheme for traffic management energy according to priorities set by traffic authorities (including targets) that will facilitate the coexistence of heterogeneous actors or fleets on the road network (individual vehicles, public transport, Vulnerable Road Users) as well as, at different levels of vehicle automation (including human driven vehicles) in mixed traffic. Actions should contribute to the transformation of traffic management from managing traffic volumes to the management of vehicles (or even travellers) taking benefit from the advantages of fleet management (groups of vehicles that share the same attributes). Vehicles should be considered in their different sizes and usages, as well as by the mobility service they provide (private, public, shared, pooled etc.). Proposed actions should address both the transport of people and goods within automated fleets (commercial/logistics fleets, fleets operated by public or private transport operators) and individual vehicles (CCAM- or conventional vehicles, including micro-mobility) that are well integrated in the entire traffic management system. Proposed actions are expected to develop and demonstrate orchestration schemes for operations in mixed traffic by addressing all of the following aspects:
1.	Defining the comprehensive requirements (including data exchange) for the orchestration schemes with regards to the heterogeneous actors in mixed traffic (automated and non-automated traffic, people and goods and different modes).
2.	Developing traffic management tools that are essential for the coordination of mixed automated and non-automated mobility. These management tools should be robust and able to address uncertainty due to uncertain technological developments, performances, services and business cases that go beyond what is available through current research results. Tools should support orchestration by, among others, integration of ad-hoc and manoeuvre coordination (SAE cooperation classes 326 ), efficient route guidance and capacity aware demand management.
3.	Defining and demonstrating business and governance models (including for public actors) for the orchestration of traffic management in real-time CCAM traffic conditions in urban and motorway environment, allowing actors to address their needs on a win-win basis.
4.	Developing measures and KPIs to demonstrate the benefits and added value of orchestration for traffic management actions (in terms of traffic efficiency, energy efficiency, safety etc.).
5.	Demonstrating a process that ensures trust in the traffic orchestration scheme proposed as well as sufficient accessibility to quality data for all traffic actors involved and readiness for large-scale demonstration actions.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.

HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-04, AI for advanced and collective perception and decision making for CCAM applications (CCAM Partnership),9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Approaches for resilient collective awareness, which can eventually be used in e.g. complex models of collective behaviour.
?	Advanced collective awareness, decision making and triggering of actions for CCAM applications, enabled by new concepts and tools built on advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Hybrid Intelligence (HI).
?	CCAM solutions evolving from reactive into predictive system state awareness (including driver state and road user diversity), decision making and actuation, enhancing road safety.
?	Understanding of AI-related ethical issues and user needs, together with capabilities, limitations and potential conflicts of AI based systems for CCAM, including a definition and a measure of human-like control.
?	Increased user acceptability and societal benefit of CCAM solutions, based on explainable, trustworthy and human-centric AI. Interactions with AI-based vehicles are understandable, human-like and reflect human psychological capabilities.
Scope: Today?s mobility landscape is rapidly changing, as is seen in the recent boom in the detection of advanced and/or complex urban scenarios that add new challenges to the development of CCAM technologies. These novel scenarios are especially emerging with the establishment of new urban traffic regimes and cultures, such as restricted zones, shared zones, and cycle-streets, which need to be taken into account when designing and developing CCAM solutions.

To integrate and tackle complex traffic scenarios, CCAM technologies will require highly advanced decision-making based on enhanced collective awareness ? the stage beyond on- board perception, advancing on e.g. results from projects under CL5-2022-D6-01-05328 ? incorporating information from multiple sources and including interpretation for the aggregation of this information. Developing collective awareness should take into account the state of the vehicle, the driver and the road user environment. It can also involve the tracking of other road users' behaviour and generating predictions on a short horizon, which can be based on the input from advanced behavioural models, e.g. those developed within CL5-2022- D6-01-03329 projects. The integration of these findings will lead to collective awareness for CCAM.
The use of multiple sources (sensors and sensor fused information, maps, infrastructure, other road users, and localisation systems) and the sharing of the overall situational information and related intentions of the vehicle and that of its direct environment will be an important building block towards collective awareness. Eventually, in future work this can be incorporated in complex, self-organised bottom-up models of collective behaviour based on the change/modelling of individual interactions. Collective awareness should create a larger time window in safety critical situations and generate benefits for the overarching mobility system, which include efficient traffic management and improved traffic flow as it incorporates situation prediction capabilities and environmental benefits (which can eventually include e.g. smart charging strategies).
AI is a key enabler to bring these increasing amounts of information together, with decision- making enabled both at vehicle level (including safety critical decisions) and at a mobility system level. In order to continue to define the role and limits of AI and of emerging new developments within AI, this topic recommends exploring Hybrid Intelligence (HI) as such a new subset of AI. Hybrid Intelligence is the process of developing and mobilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) to expand on human intelligence and expertise, thereby ensuring human-like control of CCAM operations. Applying an HI approach will allow CCAM technologies to integrate human expertise and intentionality into its decision-making in order to generate meaningful and appropriate actions that are aligned with ethical, legal and societal values. This will be essential to foster user acceptability, trust and adoption, especially when appropriate SSH expertise is included.
Proposed R&I actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:

1.	Methods to establish collective awareness of CCAM applications that are resilient to faulty sources, thereby ensuring safe operations. Guidance for failsafe designs should be developed.
2.	Methods to embed an HI approach in the entire action chain towards collective awareness (from basic perception to driving functions) to allow for seamless operation and real-time decision-making while enabling human-like control of CCAM applications

by combining system and domain knowledge (of the vehicle and its technologies on one hand and of the transport environment including all the human interactions on the other, thereby understanding of potential risks and capabilities and needs of other road users). Tooling will be required to deliver situational awareness information in a structured way, based on multiple sources and in real-time. In addition, the development and integration of ethical goal functions to support collective awareness should be included. Work is expected to be based on:
?	At least perception systems, sensor fusion, high-level world models/maps, vehicle positioning information. Guidance on common reference systems for positioning and time for synchronisation should be included in order to secure robustness and traceability.
?	Relationships between the vehicle and forecasted intentions of other road users (e.g. a pedestrian crossing the street at a zebra crossing), as such including spatial temporal relation of elements in the driving-situation.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.
Proposals should monitor and align relevant developments under this topic with on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.

for some stakeholder categories332. The Knowledge Base should be expanded and further adapted to the needs of all relevant stakeholders. Results and lessons learned from the EU, national and international projects should be made available and accessible to targeted user groups. Proposed actions should in particular provide support for stakeholders to move into operations by identifying key building blocks and standards for deploying pilot services and enable capacity building for key actors of different use cases /applications domains as well as for citizens and non-experts on how to use CCAM systems and services and to become aware of new developments and related risks.
The EU Common Evaluation Methodology (EU-CEM) developed in project ?FAME? funded under CL5-2021-D6-01-06333 aims at becoming the basic methodology for all CCAM related evaluations to support collaboration, exchange and harmonisation. The methodology will need to be implemented for existing and innovative use cases by CCAM projects and aligned with national mobility strategies and approaches. Training programmes for CCAM projects will be necessary to integrate the methodology and to collect feedback on lessons learned during its implementation.
A States Representatives Group (SRG)334 has been created within the CCAM Partnership to ensure a continuous dialogue at European and national level for the sharing of information on CCAM R&I to increase coordination between European and national R&I funding schemes, and among national programmes. To carry out its mission efficiently, the SRG will need support to collect and analyse information on national R&I initiatives and to implement cooperation activities.
To successfully contribute to the expected outcomes, proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:
1.	Ensure the maintenance and expansion of the Knowledge Base to support the CCAM stakeholder community and CCAM Partnership for the identification of future needs for R&I, testing and demonstration initiatives and for moving into operations (minimum block requirements, standards and common definitions to run pilot services across Europe). The content of the Knowledge Base should support the monitoring of the progress made on the targets and impacts set by the CCAM Partnership335.
2.	Identify further needs for targeted content for specific stakeholder categories and in particular, develop content that is accessible to non-experts, thereby supporting capacity building of the general public. The proposed action should define the above-mentioned stakeholder categories, and develop a subsequent communication strategy (content, material, media, etc.) using realistic and accessible terms to address different target groups (including non-experts).

HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-06," Optimising multimodal network and traffic management, harnessing data from infrastructures, mobility of passengers and freight transport",9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,4.00 to 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to at least 4 of the following expected outcomes:
?	Optimised multimodal transport network and traffic management, for efficient door-to- door mobility of passengers and freight (from producers to last mile deliveries).
?	Validated solutions for effective and secure data exchange across all modes of transport, for dynamic and responsive multimodal network and traffic management.
?	Validated systems for accurate detection and resolution of network bottlenecks, improving safety, security, resilience and overall performance of the transport network, enabling pro-active mobility management.
?	New tools and services for optimising mobility of passengers and freight, in cities and other areas, cutting traffic jams and improving multimodal traffic flows. The proposed solutions should demonstrate (e.g. through simulations, pilots) the potential to reduce by at least 30% the average travel delay, as well as the overall transport energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants in the network.
?	Workable governance arrangements for multimodal transport network and traffic management, in view of further supporting regulatory and policy actions.

Scope: Optimised multimodal network and traffic management is essential for an efficient transport network and seamless door-to-door mobility of passengers and freight. Such advanced capabilities need to be supported by harnessing data from physical and digital infrastructures, as well as from the mobility of passengers and freight, involving different types of vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft and vessels (including zero-emission, connected and automated), technologies and the use of innovative services. At the same time, novel forms of mobility (e.g. shared, micro-mobility or even hyperloop) and new services (e.g. Mobility as a Service) present new challenges, but also great opportunities for enhanced management and optimisation of the transport network. This includes advances to fully utilise dynamic and interoperable data exchange from multiple actors and transport modes, for well-tested and validated systems and operations, with appropriate governance arrangements in place.
In this context, building on best practices (technological, non-technological and socio- economic), ongoing projects on multimodal network and traffic management, as well as other initiatives (e.g. the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum and the common European mobility data space), actions should address at least 6 of the following aspects:
?	Developing and testing new generation multimodal, flexible, agile and adaptable, secure and resilient transport network and traffic management systems, leveraging state of the art technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, big data, edge computing, internet of things, blockchain).
?	Assessing and simulating the effects on multimodal network and traffic management of new forms of mobility (e.g. zero-emission, connected and automated vehicles and vessels, car sharing/pooling, active-/micro-mobility, sustainable land/air transport modes and drones), as well as of innovative services (e.g. Mobility/Logistics as a Service), in different urban and rural environments, considering the socio-economic acceptability and different user needs (including vulnerable and gender groups).
?	Performing simulations for network-wide optimisation of traffic models, aiming towards a ?social optimum? and an evaluation of mobility options for multimodal mobility and freight flows (including last-mile), enabling a modal shift to more sustainable modes (leveraging public transport), while addressing planned and unplanned events of mobility and freight systems under disruption.
?	Demonstrating the collection, aggregation, analysis and use of network-wide data from infrastructures, vehicles/vessels and users (using ICT and EU satellite-based systems), from across transport modes (modal and intermodal data), stakeholders and national borders, while preserving data privacy, security and confidentiality to data providers, thereby enabling effective and intelligent multimodal network and traffic management, and even further data exchanges with other sectors (e.g. energy and telecoms).
?	Performing early pilot activities on multimodal network and traffic management of limited scale in mobility hubs (e.g. rail nodes, maritime or inland ports), where cross- modal or hinterland inter-connections are present for passenger and freight traffic flows.

?	Designing and testing innovative multimodal network and traffic management services, offered by public and/or private stakeholders, which can be operated at network centres (e.g. at cities or hubs) and/or at decentralised level (e.g. by users or vehicles/vessels themselves).
?	Developing and showcasing workable governance and dynamic incentive models, for the effective engagement of public and private stakeholders in interoperable data exchange, in the optimisation of transport network and traffic management and in promoting a better use of (public) transport systems.
?	Evaluating the qualitative and quantitative impact of the proposed measures and project results, including on reducing travel delay, transport emissions and energy consumption, with a clear baseline for each use case.
If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries are expected to describe if and how the use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS are incorporated in the proposed solutions. In addition, proposals should describe the technological and societal readiness of the systems and/or techniques proposed for development and use, particularly in the case of systems based on Artificial Intelligence.
The multimodal aspects listed above are complementary and in synergy with actions foreseen in other parts of the Work Programme, such as in the areas of C-ITS (as part of Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility), rail traffic management (as part of EU-Rail Joint Undertaking), air traffic management (as part of SESAR 3 Joint Undertaking) and vessel traffic management (as part of Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport).

?	Test and demonstrate sound business and governance models and rules (including organisational change requirements) for resource-sharing across logistics networks, to ensure operational efficiency of freight movements irrespective of mode, nodal operations and freight characteristics.
?	Test and demonstrate the functionalities and relevance of the data sharing framework, serving for optimisation of the logistic system, including through the establishment of an appropriate semantic model and its components, such as for instance Digital Twins with specific algorithms allowing for predictive planning of logistic related events.

Innovative digital tools and solutions to monitor and improve the management and operation of transport infrastructure,9/5/2024,IA,5/7/2024,,,Around 5.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to ALL of the following outcomes (with a clear baseline for each use case):
?	Better interconnection of transport infrastructure and transport means resulting in optimised door-to-door mobility for passengers and goods by assuring at least 30% reduction of average delay (time lost per vehicle per km).
?	Reduction of transport operation costs by 20% for transport operators along with 20% reduction of fossil fuels consumption in transport.
?	Assessment and redesign of existing infrastructure (e.g. cycling lanes, walking paths, charging points, parking spaces etc.) in order to ensure its effective and safe use by different transport modes. Different infrastructure types should be assessed in each of the pilot demonstrations and safe coexistence of various forms of mobility enhanced (e.g. soft, active, shared mobility).
?	Increase in the robustness of transport infrastructure by reducing the infrastructure failure probability by 30%.

?	Reduce the transport emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants by 30% by 2030 in the pilot demonstrations.
?	Reduce the number of accidents involving infrastructure users and infrastructure workers by 50% in the pilot demonstrations.
Scope: Innovative digital tools and solutions will allow to upgrade transport infrastructure ensuring an improved performance and safety, together with a reduction of emissions and better inclusiveness. Increasing the performance of multi-modal transport infrastructure can be achieved through improving the efficiency of the assets and by the cross-modal data management. Digital solutions are key to reduce drastically disruptions in traffic flows, increase transport efficiency and lower its dependency on fossil fuels.
Transport infrastructure needs to be capable of harvesting the benefits from digitalisation at management and operations levels, as well as in relation with the user. Digitalisation can support the achievement of sustainability targets and provide a better service to infrastructure end users, including enhanced public transport services. Digital technologies, such as big data, the Internet of Things, Digital Twins, together with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques provide a great potential for developing mobility solutions.
The integration between transport infrastructure and digital technologies will help achieve personalised seamless passenger and freight journeys transport across different transport modes. This integration will consider safety and security starting from the design phase, while simultaneously automating and accelerating the decision process at every level from maintenance to traffic management.
Special attention should be given to the accessibility of new digital tools from persons with disabilities and older persons, in order to ensure that this segment of the population is also able to participate fully and benefit from digital progress. As set by the Green Deal, priorities should be given for projects allowing modal shift from road to more sustainable mode such rail and inland waterways.
Proposals will have to address all of the following points:

?	Improve performance of transport infrastructure and increase multimodality with the use of, for example: IoT, edge computing and decentralised artificial intelligence, or other digital tools in view of its potential to facilitate real-time decision-making, improve safety and to save bandwidth and energy. Develop solutions for self-monitoring, self- reporting, non-intrusive/non-destructive inspection and testing methods, including advanced predictive modelling and structural safety assessment.
?	Demonstrate ability to process internal and external raw data, such as sensor data, into smart data and related cloud architecture that can be deployed to optimize infrastructure management processes
?	Building on the common European mobility data space and the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum (DTLF), facilitate the seamless use and provision of data and

information to the end user across the transport infrastructure network and logistic chain, with a view to progress advancing towards smart mobility concepts for passengers and freight.
?	Enhance prediction of demand from individual behaviours, enabling appropriate modal capacity and demand management.
?	Propose digital solutions contributing to a more inclusive, comfortable, accessible and flexible infrastructures and multi-modal services.
?	Include at least three pilot demonstrations of the proposed solutions in operational environment (minimum at TRL7) on land and inland waterways transport infrastructure.
?	Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative impact of the proposed measures with a clear baseline for each pilot demonstration.
For rail infrastructure the solutions will need to be harmonised with the EU-RailRAIL Programme projects implementing the Flagship Area 1, 3 and 5339. Proposals should consider results from previous calls on infrastructure maintenance, digitalisation, and on edge-IoT, and focus on validation of innovative solutions (i.e. robotics, IoT, edge computing and AI).

HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-09, Policies and governance shaping the future transport and mobility systems,9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	A better understanding of the effects of governance341, policies342, and incentives, but also land use and spatial planning, on the choice of individuals, families, or social groups of different kinds to use a specific transport and/or mobility mode.
?	Reinforced public engagement in shaping co-created transport and mobility policies.
?	Effective policy interventions, co-created with target constituencies and building on high-quality policy; strengthening of research-policy cooperation models to reinforce impact and trust in science.
?	More effective and sustainable national, regional and transnational transport and mobility policies toward accepted approaches, based on a system-thinking perspective.
?	Better harnessing the potential of digitised mobility data while protecting citizen?s privacy.
?	Providing concepts and policy recommendations sustainably integrating passenger and freight transportation in order to create a future proof holistic mobility system.
Scope: Governance, policies and incentives play an important role in shaping transport and mobility systems and influence the development and implementation of different technologies and modes of transport (e.g. walking, cycling, public transport and rail). It is therefore important to study how policies and regulations could be best used to govern transport and mobility systems in desired directions, so that they become more sustainable and just, for instance with regard to gender, place, or low-income households, as well as their fiscal impacts.

341	Governance is all the processes of interactions be they through laws, norms, power or language of an organized society over a social system, done by the government of a state.
342	Policies are deliberate systems of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within a national or local authority.

In addition, the COVID-19 crisis has significantly altered commuting habits; remote and telework have become widespread together with other flexible work arrangements. The true impact of these changes on gas emissions and on the well-being of people as well as on the real-estate market (offices) are not known. This is now an opportunity to leverage on an ongoing change in habits that could result in significant GHG reduction.
Proposals should address all of the following aspects:

?	Analyse the influence of politicians on the making of sustainable and non-sustainable transport policies, as well as the impact of their design on accessibility in peripheral areas, identifying synergies with the reform of governance instruments of the European Union (e.g. Trans-European Transport Network, Urban Mobility Framework) to enhance the gradual phase-out policy effect for private car ownership.
?	Propose approaches that better integrate mobility policies with policies from other sectors (e.g. energy efficiency, renewables, gender mainstreaming, healthcare, retail and poverty and low income population reduction).
?	Consider the benefits of public/private partnerships towards future transport and mobility system, as to secure local adjustment and solutions that are effective and economic for private stakeholders, with a long-term sustainable horizon for the society.
?	Identify and assess the potential of (shared) mobility hubs at neighbourhood-level and define the role of organisational innovations in supporting them.
?	Explore how small, medium cities and metropolitan areas manage the emergence of micro-mobility and how driverless vehicles are likely to affect urban areas and land use (e.g. mixed use of urban space, dynamic parking).
?	Identify the major flaws on national transport and mobility regulations in EU countries and provide recommendations on how to better harmonize them trans-nationally (e.g. incentives for putting bicycles on trains etc.).
?	Identify regulations and accountability measures to ensure that mobility data are best utilised for the common good, for example, harnessing the potential of data to stimulate innovation for more sustainable mobility behaviour patterns and guide urban planning, while also protecting citizen privacy.
?	Analyse the drivers for public acceptability of stringent and mandatory transport policies (e.g. carbon taxes, urban traffic bans).
?	Examine the most effective strategies in promoting the transition to more sustainable freight transport in Europe following the recent and ongoing changes in consumer culture, such as the increase in e-commerce and online.
A ?social optimum? balance should be included to developing research knowledge within new governance models from several perspectives (e.g. socio-economic, environmental, health,

accessibility, gender and inclusion, safety and security aspects). This concept complements the work launched within the Cities Mission regarding MaaR (Mobility as a Right). Synergies with the projects GECKO 343 , ACCTING 344 and SHARED GREEN DEAL 345 should  be explored, given that mobility behaviours and the role of cities as agent of change will influence policy makers in enabling adaptive and anticipatory regulatory schemes and governance with novel policies contributing to sustainable mobility goals.
In addition to the research activities, actions are expected to involve citizens from different backgrounds and origins in the policy analysis to gather and study their understanding, perceptions, opinions and positions, thus contributing to co-designing and co-assessing the most appropriate policies? recommendations. The collection of children?s views can also be included in the study. Citizen platforms if existing, can be used for this purpose.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research.",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-10," Ensuring the safety, resilience and security of waterborne digital systems",9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased safety and resilience of waterborne digital systems, including system of systems and their functions and considering both malicious intervention and system failure with particular regard to the application of artificial intelligence methodologies, networks of sensors and the onshore on-board communications.
?	Improved system design addressing human factors issues in the changing levels of human/automated system interactions
?	Assurance of the resilience, safety and security of waterborne digital and connected systems is undertaken on the basis of robust methodologies to a similar standard to that applied within other sectors which apply safety critical digital technology and their application in safety critical conditions including the safety of navigation and its systems.
?	Robust by design waterborne digital and connected systems for safety and resilience (incl. reliability regimes such as fail safe, fail secure, fail to operation etc., HAZOP, system of systems, security, hardware and equipment data, etc.)
?	Methodologies to enable effective HAZOP analysis and validation of waterborne digital systems are developed and disseminated, increasing the use of common approaches, also when using artificial intelligence applications.
?	Increased software safety (incl. functional analysis and reliability assessment).
?	Increased cyber security for operation and maintenance (incl. software maintenance).
Scope: Increasingly, modern waterborne transport relies upon smart digital and connected systems to ensure safe and efficient operation. Within large complex vessels, system of systems approaches are used together with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence approaches to integrate diverse systems ranging from sensors, business and cargo management systems, power and engine management, electronic navigation and situational awareness. System integration of systems with proprietary digital control systems has become more and more critical in terms of ensuring safety and efficiency. The complexity and foundation upon software, makes assurance of the resilience of such systems challenging and requires a different to that applied to hardware- based systems. Waterborne digital system can be vulnerable to both malicious intervention and the consequences of system failure. Examples have included the spoofing of navigational GPS signals, ransom wear attacks on integrated container management systems, complete power shutdown and the helicopter evacuation of a large passenger ship when engine protection systems identified a common fault across all engine waterborne systems. The challenge to assure the safety and resilience of digital systems is particularly important within large complex vessels where the level of

integration and connectivity is high and where the consequences of failure can be particularly severe.
In the domain of power generation and management the vastness of new technological solutions, often driven by environmental regulations, poses new challenges in ships? design and management, where the need for integration of diverse energy converters (ICEs, batteries, fuel cells, wind, capacitors, etc.) confront designers and operators with systems based on profoundly different operating principles coming together with different requirements and control and digital systems. Integration for harnessing the full potential in a safe and secure frame is key to their implementation.
Furthermore, the capability of integrating different systems (and their dynamics) involve an always increased number of sensors, whose data, fused, should become available for optimisation and increased awareness during normal and safe critical operations.
Comprehensive HAZOP (Hazard Operability) studies are essential for such vessels, yet the methodologies are poorly established within the waterborne sector whilst other sectors operating safety critical digital systems (aerospace, nuclear, medical automotive etc.) have well established practices. Furthermore, applying ?hardware in the loop? to simulation and validation of digital systems in dependent on the quality of the digital simulation model. This can be difficult for waterborne transport due to the variability of ship designs, complexity and lack of relevant data concerning the integrated components. Pre-delivery testing and sea trials could include fault simulation and digital testing founded upon the identification of critical digital systems identified by the HAZOP, yet such trials focus on hard-ware or subsystems such as rudder control rather than addressing the entire integration. For safety critical systems, reliability regimes need to be established to identify the safe default state in case of system failure or the identification of malicious intervention. In this respect the best system state could be: ?fail operational?, ?fail soft?, ?fail safe?, ?fail secure?, ?fail passive?, ?be fault tolerant?.
Activities will address the development of a HAZOP methodology for whole system assessment of highly digitised, connected complex vessels. The methodology should include system, system of systems designed for specific function or sets of functions and/or a methodology for the entire vessel, including when application of artificial intelligence algorithms is foreseen. The methodology will be developed with relevant stakeholders including shipbuilders, system designers and equipment providers, IT professionals, operators, class societies, regulators. The acceptability of the methodology to all stakeholders will be assessed and an implementation roadmap will be developed to account for any identified barriers. Work will draw upon the expertise of other sectors with more developed procedures for the assessment and assurance of digital safety.
On-board systems and functions integration by design, for safe and secure operation should be used to test and demonstrate the safety and security of the applications.
The developed methodology will be applied to a representative complex highly digitised vessel, safety critical systems and functions will be identified, and appropriate reliability

regimes and mitigation measures will be established with consideration of both malicious intervention and system failure.
Cost effective methodologies for validating the safety, resilience and correct functioning of digital and connected safety critical ship systems, including system of systems, will be developed and demonstrated.
?	In case of validation on the basis of a theoretical digital models and/or digital twinning (e.g. hardware in the loop) then the validity of the model should be proven as well as its flexibility to be applied towards a range of vessel designs.
?	In case of validation on the basis of physical testing of the responses of the final system to a range of fault conditions and malicious interventions during the final trials, there should be assurance that test conditions are representative of the identified risks.
Guidance should be produced and disseminated concerning the recommended methodology for assuring the safety and resilience of complex digitalised and connected shipping.
The safety assessment should be developed by using methodologies suitable for being assessed in international fora such as the International Maritime Organisation.",

?	Transport systems that are resilient, i.e. prepared for disruptive changes of different kinds, and thereby supporting continuously improved traffic safety.
?	Resilience to unexpected events (pandemics, natural disasters, political decisions, conflicts, energy and fuel disruptions etc.) as an integrated principle in the design and development of future transport systems.
?	Increased understanding how sudden changes in the availability of transport means e.g. through dramatic weather events or emission induced ban of certain vehicles in a city, affect the safety of transport system users, and the underlying psychological effects for users? reactions.
Scope: The importance of a robust transport systems becomes highly evident in times of rapid, changes that are neither planned, scheduled nor predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic has pointed at several issues (e.g. delivery of essential goods, ensuring uninterrupted and safe public transport operations for essential workers etc.) that need to be addressed to secure future resilience of the transport system and to ensure that the level of transport safety is not only maintained, but also meeting more demanding targets. For instance, the decreased use of public transport during the pandemic has to some extent led to increases in both biking and walking, but also an increased use of cars in some parts of the world. At the same time, decreased traveling has meant fewer vehicles on the roads in certain areas, whereas others have seen an increase of delivery vehicles, as home deliveries have surged. Likewise, the current energy market realities have made even more pressing the need of an energy efficient mobility system that could absorb disruptions in the fuel supply chain.
Digital tools/services and new transport means (e.g. urban air mobility and micro mobility), new ways how to use the infrastructure (e.g. even more shared spaces with different types of vehicles, both highly automated and manually controlled) in a more energy efficient manner and new behaviour should be included in the research.
In order to provide safe and resilient transport for all, many aspects are expected to be considered in a clearly multidisciplinary approach. Proposed actions are expected to address at least three out of the following aspects:
?	Scenarios of disruptive changes that can make a transport system unstable should be identified, the consequences on transport safety be analysed, and solutions to tackle them

346	This decision is available on the Funding and Tenders Portal, in the reference documents section for Horizon	Europe,	under	?Simplified	costs	decisions?	or	through	this	link: https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/guidance/ls- decision_he_en.pdf

developed. This includes safety implications of rapid changes / new incentives (sometimes contradictory to previous ones, e.g. regarding the use of public transport in a pandemic situation).
?	Analysis of how socio-economic differences may affect the safety of individuals in case of disruptive changes (e.g. individual mobility options are determined by the socio- economic status).
?	Study of how the concept of resilience at the system level can be applied and used for the improvement of transport safety.
?	Evaluation of the potential and development of recommendations on how to improve transport safety and resilience through suburban planning and future housing developments with their effects on the demand for transport and through the design of transport infrastructure networks.
A definition of resilience in the context of transport systems should be provided, and factors of transport safety and energy efficiency that are essential to take into account should be determined. Moreover, scenarios for disruptive changes should be identified that can make a transport system instable, the consequences on transport safety be analysed, and solutions to tackle them be developed. Hence, a structured method to secure safety as an integrated part in resilient transport systems should be provided.
A solid foundation for this research is the Safe System Approach. It requires the inclusion of relevant expertise in social sciences and humanities (SSH) and will benefit from international cooperation.",
HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-12, A new framework to improve traffic safety culture in the EU,9/5/2024,RIA,5/7/2024,,,Around 3.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Research results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:

?	Growing a positive traffic safety culture across the EU that supports the Vision Zero goal and the Safe System Approach, and which is in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the 2020 Stockholm Declaration, UN General Assembly Resolution and Global Plan of Action for the second decade on road safety
?	Remedial action against detrimental, non-temporary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain road safety risk factors such as a shift from collective to individual means of transport. Facilitation of a shift to increase efficiency in road safety related public spending across Europe together with a shift towards more energy efficient mobility choices.
?	Development and evaluation of strategies to transform the traffic safety culture of road users and stakeholders based on a valid model that identifies the key components defining traffic safety culture, including, for example, social norms, attitudes, perceived control, values, and system assumptions (including its energy efficiency and consumption)
?	Concepts and guidelines to make the concept of traffic safety culture an integral part of road safety work of actors across the socio-economic systems of European societies
?	Better understanding of the link between road safety outcomes and safety culture; pilot implementation of road safety education at secondary school level and also for decision makers and practitioners in EU Member States/Associated countries.
Scope: A Safe System entails the understanding and managing of all elements of the transport system, including the behaviour and interplay of its actors. Comparative analysis shows persistent differences in road safety performances between EU Member States/Associated countries. These differences may be attributable to differences in culture, which are hard to explain with classical risk models. Efforts should therefore be made to complement road

safety initiatives by a safety culture perspective, i.e., the values, beliefs, priorities and viewpoints shared among groups of road users and stakeholders that influence their decisions to behave or act in ways that affect safety, while also considering energy consumption. This concept is already well established in organisational research.
Assessing road safety cultures in different national, regional or local systems, groups and organisations is believed to help understanding and explaining different patterns of risk perception and risk taking across communities and countries ? and can likewise inform tailored interventions for these (sub-)cultures, which all come with their specific norms, values, beliefs and behaviours. These interventions should address all relevant actors in the system for road transport of people and goods, and consider future developments, such as potential impacts by increasing automation levels or by the introduction of new means of road transport such as e-scooters and hoverboards.
Within this context, actions should contribute to establishing a framework for cultural transformation in road safety across the EU and thereby address all the following aspects:
?	Better understanding of the link between road safety outcomes and safety culture, i.e. of sociocultural factors like values, beliefs, attitudes, and norms and their effects on actual behaviour of road users (including subjective perception of safety as well as implications of value of time and institutionalised travel costs) ? and the ways how these factors can be sustainably transformed.
?	Consideration in particular - but not exclusively - of traffic behaviour with high safety impacts, such as inadequate speed choice, distraction by communication or control devices, driving or riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs, non-use of protective devices, and risks triggered by professional drivers? requirements to multitask and report while driving.
?	Assessment of safety cultures and respective activities from other transport modes such as aviation and rail and their potential for road safety.
?	Assessment of the interplay between shifting to more energy efficient mobility solutions and traffic safety.
?	Consideration of safety impacts of new technologies (including better understanding and use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)) and emerging transport means and services.
?	Consideration of the safety impact of the increasing penetration of urban micro-mobility systems in mixed traffic scenarios and evaluation of potential safety improvements for the protection of micro-mobility users.
?	Stocktaking of good practices from countries and companies worldwide already successfully applying cultural approaches to (road) safety work, including countries outside of the EU such as the US and Australia.

?	Targeting all levels of the socio-economic systems of societies in the EU, i.e. from European to national, regional and local communities, including entities such as schools and workplaces. Also, NGOs, victims? organisations etc. can play an important role in that regard.
?	Clear guidance & hands-on advice on the design and evaluation of interventions to define, measure, transform and institutionalise traffic safety culture across all areas affecting road safety ? for decision-makers and practitioners, with a good geographic coverage across EU institutions, EU Member States/Associated countries. At the level of individual road users, including VRUs, such interventions may entail targeted educational and communication efforts to challenge wrong beliefs or to clarify misperceived social norms, and the use of incentives and nudging to encourage compliant behaviour. At the level of enterprises and authorities, initiatives may include the take-up of safety culture principles in sustainability reporting and encompass various activities from staff training and supervision to procurement and operations ? at best permeating work culture and norms of an organisation. Advice at the level of EU Member States/Associated countries and the EU is sought on how to support such transformation such as with legislation, enforcement, and data.
?	At least three different pilot tests of selected interventions at various levels in different EU Member States/Associated countries.
Actions should be based on the results of previous research projects in this domain, such as the TraSaCu project, and make advances by completing and updating their theoretical foundations, teaming up with EU stakeholders and bringing their findings to life by establishing a framework for true cultural transformation in road safety both among stakeholders and road users. Making use of data that is already being collected in EU Member States/Associated countries about traffic safety culture such as the ESRA initiative (which already involves 60 countries, including over 20 European ones) and Baseline348 project is strongly encouraged.
Special attention should be given to EU countries with lower safety performance 349 . Integration of relevant expertise from social sciences and humanities (SSH) and international cooperation with partners from the US and/or Australia is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-1, Better understanding of routes of exposure and toxicological and ecological impacts of chemical pollution on terrestrial biodiversity,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.50-4,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU zero pollution action plan and the EU pollinators initiative, projects results will contribute to the following impact of destination ?biodiversity and ecosystem services?: ?Understand and address direct drivers of biodiversity decline??.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Routes of exposure, linked to ecosystem and biodiversity dynamics to chemicals are better understood,
?	Issues raised by the contamination of biodiversity in the natural environment are better known, including risks linked to existing contaminations (legacy), chemicals of emerging concern and accumulations in nature,
?	Environmental fate of new chemicals of emerging concern is better understood,
?	Toxicological and ecological impacts of contaminants are better understood and risk assessments for relevant highly exposed species are strengthened,
?	Prevention and mitigation measures are identified and developed.
Scope: According to IPBES global assessment report , pollution is one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss. This topic focuses on chemical pollution, which has been increasing in the last decades with key differences by region and by type of pollution. Quantitative assessments include systematically monitored variables with certain emissions into the atmosphere, water bodies and terrestrial systems from industrial activities and households. However, pollution has and is still changing not only in quantitative but also qualitative terms and the monitoring of many dangerous substances, including ones of emerging concern, and knowledge on the way they impact biodiversity and ecosystem services are missing. This topic aims at better understanding the routes of exposure and toxicological and ecological impacts of chemical pollution (excluding industrial contamination) on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems  (Area A). According to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, pressures include the release of nutrients, chemical pesticides, pharmaceuticals, hazardous chemicals, urban and industrial wastewater and other waste including litter and plastics.
The intensification of the loss of biodiversity in the EU is strongly influenced by the intensification of agriculture, through the high application of fertilizers and pesticides, changes in the species and management of crops, as well as mowing and grazing regimes, and the introduction of new production technologies. Currently, the excessive use of pesticides causes a reduction in the population of, among others, pollinating insects. To support the long-term sustainability of both nature and farming, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 works in tandem with the farm to fork strategy. The Commission has committed with both strategies to take action to reduce by 50% the overall use of - and the risk from ? chemical pesticides by 2030 and reduce by 50% the use of more hazardous pesticides by 2030 in order to reverse the alarming decline of farmland biodiversity.
Successful proposals are expected to assess the effects and impact of chemical pollutants, in particular the most dangerous substances from agriculture, on the condition of the biodiversity and ecosystems in natural environment (this may include environmental and host associated microbiomes) and consequently on human health, and identify preventive and mitigation measures. It is important to pay special attention to the fact that the reduction in the population of pollinating insects caused, inter alia, by the excessive use of pesticides in EU agriculture also contributes to reducing the amount of food for birds, reducing the regulation of pests, diseases and invasive alien species. More knowledge is also needed on additional negative impacts from other contaminants of emerging concern, including pharmaceuticals such as hormones and antibiotics, veterinary products and persistent e.g., bio-accumulative substances.
In the context of the EU pollinators? initiative and the pesticide legislative framework , the EU has increased efforts in the last decade to address this problem. However, knowledge gaps still hinder development and implementation of essential testing methods for a scientifically robust risk assessment of pesticides on wild bees and other wild pollinating insects. This topic will provide a critical contribution to address those knowledge gaps as identified by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the Commission (Area B) and thereby support the implementation of the EFSA guidance on the risk assessment of plant protection products on bees (Apis mellifera, Bombus spp. and solitary bees) and the efforts on broadening the risk assessment safeguards to other wild pollinator species.
Proposals should address Area A or Area B as follows. The Area should be clearly indicated on the application.
Area A: better understanding the routes of exposure of the wild fauna and flora to chemical pollution
Successful proposals should:
?	Choose case studies, based on an analysis of chemical contaminations from an environmental history perspective, with representative species on which analysis will be undertaken. Addressing trophic chains is encouraged,
?	Develop a method to establish the routes of contamination with chemicals. Priority should be given to cases with potential contamination with chemical pesticides and their metabolites; contaminants of emerging concern, including pharmaceuticals such as hormones and antibiotics, veterinary products and persistent e.g., bio-accumulative substances, SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) and emerging pollutants. Other substances in particular micro- and nano-plastics are not excluded. Existing contaminations of the environment (legacy) especially from pesticides should also be considered. However industrial contamination is not in the scope of this topic,
?	Establish the routes of contamination of the chosen representative species with chemicals, in the case studies,
?	Assess the risks resulting from such contaminations for species, for ecosystems and for the local environment, including development of effect-based approach to consider mixture effects and synergies,
?	In particular, establish models to link chemical ecotoxicity stress to damages on (a) genetic diversity, (b) functional diversity, and (c) ecosystem services,
?	Extrapolate to provide an assessment of risks associated with chemical contaminations of terrestrial wild biodiversity at a larger scale,
?	Explore prevention and mitigation measures.
Targets groups for this Area are notably regulatory bodies, farmers and other land managers organisations, civil society, local and regional decision ?makers.
Successful proposals are expected to cooperate with relevant projects supported by the mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe"".
Area B: pollinators and pesticides
Successful proposals should:
?	Characterise sources and routes of pesticide exposure in the key pollinator groups (wild bees, butterflies, hoverflies and moths),
?	Investigate sensitivity of pollinators to pesticides and identify for each pollinator group sensitive species that: i) are suitable as test organisms in the risk assessment and ii) require safeguards that would indirectly protect other species within the same group (?umbrella effect?),
?	Improve prediction of the toxicity endpoints, toxic units for chemicals and data poor compounds (e.g., Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models),
?	Develop toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic data and models for single and multiple chemicals,
?	Generate combined toxicity data (lethal and sublethal effects) of multiple chemicals, improving the availability of data in particular for: i) chronic combined toxicity that would make it possible to identify potential interactions that may lead to deviation from dose addition (potentiation, synergism) and ii) sublethal effects.
?	Investigate synergistic effects of typical combinations of pesticides (e.g., based on residue data),
?	Devise and test monitoring schemes for establishing the level of contamination of pollen/nectar/water/plant matrices/soil that can support benchmarking in a predictive risk assessment, development of risk indicators and a system-based risk assessment,
?	Develop an open source curated database on pollinators and the use of pesticides which would include data and information on: i) exposure and hazard, ii) lethal and sublethal effects, toxicokinetics as well as other stressors (e.g., other chemicals, nutrition, etc.) that could amplify the adverse effects through interaction with pesticides,
?	Develop methodologies for risk assessment in open-source tools including toxic units approaches using lethal and sublethal effects as well as validated in silico models applying dose addition as the default model or models integrating synergistic effects,
?	Develop population models and landscape modelling for the risk assessment of multiple chemicals in pollinators with an aim to integrate hazard and exposure information,
?	Develop environmental scenarios for the risk assessment of pollinators that takes into consideration different landscape characteristics and conditions.
Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for cooperation and networking activities. Collaboration with the European partnership on biodiversity Biodiversa+ should be explored, as needed. They should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms notably the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines.
International cooperation is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-2, Impact of light and noise pollution on biodiversity,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 3.50-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, projects will contribute to understand and address direct drivers of biodiversity decline in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
?	The impact of light and noise pollution on biodiversity and ecosystem services is better understood and nature restoration activities as planned in the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 are supported, contributing to the objective of ?at least 30% of all protected species and habitats not currently in favourable conservation status should reach favourable status or at least show a strong positive trend by 2030?,
?	The awareness of private and public stakeholders about the impacts of light and noise on biodiversity is increased,
?	Specific measures to assess, prevent and mitigate the negative impacts from light and noise on biodiversity are developed,
?	Networking capacity on impacts of light and noise on biodiversity is built.
Scope: Light pollution is the alteration of natural lighting levels due to artificial light at night. It has been rapidly increasing, with the illumination level in developed countries increasing tenfold over the last 50 years. From 2012 to 2016, Earth?s artificially lit outdoor area grew by 2.2% per year. Artificial light at night is a powerful environmental stressor which alters the biological rhythms of living organisms (fauna and flora), modifies species assemblages (e.g. fish in ports) and changes ecosystems at large. There is a broad scientific consensus that it poses a threat to biodiversity and this has led to growing concerns in recent years. Light pollution is specifically known to cause habitat fragmentation, impairing physiology and behaviour in fauna. It is notably thought to be a major factor in the gradual disappearance of insect and bird populations worldwide. Its effects seem to intensify with the use of LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes) including outside cities. Another domain of light pollution is the horizontally polarised light reflection of certain artificial surfaces (e.g. roads and photovoltaic solar panels), posing significant threat to polarotactic insects that get trapped in search for water bodies.
Noise is an environmental factor which is also given growing attention. According to IPBES, noise?s effects on nature are increasingly observed . Expansion of human population, transport networks and extraction have a range of impacts upon species, depending on auditory capacities and noise wavelengths. Underwater noises that are due not only to shipping but also to pile drivers, sonars, seismic testing or windfarms are significant marine pollutants. Noise can be particularly problematic for marine organisms. It has been shown for instance that it may modify behaviour and physiology of invertebrates and it is suspected to increase infection risks and alter spawning behaviour of affected species. It is suspected, for instance, to increase infection risks and spawning behaviour of affected species. Evidence of the impact of noise pollution on ecosystems is also growing, like the reduction of the presence of songbirds in cities.
EU policies integrate the need to protect biodiversity from light and noise in a limited extent, in particular:
?	The Habitats Directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to avoid significant disturbance of protected species in Natura 2000 sites, which, where relevant, is applicable to light pollution (Article 6.2).
?	Noise is one aspect of the good environmental status defined in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive No 2008/56.
Light and noise pollution in general is addressed in a number of EU policies and directives: the Environmental Noise Directive, the Outdoor Noise Directive, the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC). Reducing noise pollution is among the objectives of the EU Action Plan: 'Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil'. Noise and light are defined as pollutants in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, (?pollutant? means a substance, vibration, heat, noise, light or other contaminant present in air, water or land which may be harmful to human health or the environment, which may result in damage to material property, or which may impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment). Light and noise pollution is included in one of the six thematic priority objectives of the 8th Environment Action Programme to 2030 (?pursuing zero-pollution, including in relation to harmful chemicals, in order to achieve a toxic-free environment, including for air, water, soil as well as in relation to light and noise pollution, and protecting the health and well-being of people, animals and ecosystems from environment-related risks and negative impacts?).
There is a need to better understand the overall impact of these pollution sources of emerging concern on biodiversity, in particular how the conservation status of species and habitats is affected, mechanisms at stake and how to monitor and mitigate adverse effects.
Targets groups for this topic are notably regulatory bodies, civil society, local and regional decision ?makers.
Successful proposals should:
?	provide a comprehensive review on available knowledge on the impacts of noise and light pollution on biodiversity and ecosystem services (from genetic to species levels) and their combined effects with other drivers of biodiversity loss including climate change and invasive species. The scope should cover terrestrial (both in urban and rural areas), fresh water and marine environments. Projects should build upon research performed on the European level as well as by the Member States and Associated Countries,
?	assess the overall impacts of noise and light pollution on biodiversity and ecosystem services in Europe and the magnitude of the problems. This should include a scrutiny of applicable policies and their impact as well as a contextualisation of the problems from an environmental history perspective,
?	improve understanding of mechanisms leading to biodiversity loss, including effects of noise and light pollution on the behaviour of animals which can eventually affect population viability,
?	investigate how noise and light pollution affect the conservation status of species and habitats, and identify measures to avoid significant disturbance,
?	assess the need and ability of specific measures to prevent negative impacts of light and noise on biodiversity, including monitoring,
?	assess links to other policies where light and noise management is at place or relevance and synergies can be explored (disaster management, noise mapping etc.),

More specifically, project results will improve the setting of conservation objectives and measures for EU-protected habitats and species, thereby also ensuring that the network of Natura 2000 sites enable the maintenance or restoration of favourable conservation status.
Results of individual projects are expected to contribute to at least one of the following expected outcomes:
?	Favourable conservation status for species and habitats covered by the EU Birds and/or Habitats Directives, and clarification of what is needed on an EU or biogeographical scale or other ecologically relevant scale (e.g., major basin, major flyway) in line with the relevant parameters and their values on the basis of which Member States define favourable conservation status.
?	Better implementation of the EU Birds Directive specifically in relation to the 42 huntable bird species listed in Annex II of the directive which are not in a secure status, by filling scientific knowledge gap in relation to the amount and quality of habitat that is needed for these species (with a focus on their breeding habitats), and to ensure that their hunting is carried out sustainably.
Scope: Proposals should address Area A or Area B as follows. The Area should be clearly indicated on the application.
Area A: Improving the conservation status of habitats and species protected under the Habitats and/or Birds Directive.
Successful proposals should:
?	improve the definition of ?favourable conservation status? of groups of habitats and/or species protected under the EU Birds and/or Habitats Directives, provide guidance on how to improve the monitoring of habitats and species and/or the setting of favourable reference values and favourable reference conditions in Member States. The focus of this work should be on data-deficient habitats and species, on habitats and species in the worst status (conservation status and/or EU Red list status), or with declining trends  and/or on those species the recovery of which has created tensions with stakeholders (e.g., large carnivores, some geese species, cormorants, etc.). A specific focus could also be placed on habitats and species which depend on the maintenance of sustainable agricultural land management.
?	ensure the recovery of habitats and/or species in unfavourable status and/or with a declining trend according to the reporting under the EU Birds and/or Habitats Directive (2019)  by providing methodologies and recommendations on how to identify recovery needs for populations or restoration needs for habitats, including with regard to geographical location, quantity and quality of habitat to be restored.
Area B: Improving the conservation status of huntable bird species listed in Annex II of the Birds Directive.
Successful proposals should:
?	Identify habitat management and restoration needs for huntable bird species in non-secure status, with a focus on agricultural habitats, evaluate the impact of hunting and provide recommendations for an adaptive harvest management of these species, considering the available species-specific data on habitat quality and quantity impacting their fecundity and breeding success and survival rate for these species. Preparatory work done by the Commission Services should be taken into account .
Proposals should closely follow and ensure consistency with any ongoing or future relevant policy developments, with a particular focus on the voluntary EU targets for improving the status of species and habitats  and increasing the coverage of protected areas , as well as in relation to the upcoming Commission proposal for legally binding restoration targets.
Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for cooperation and networking activities. They are expected to link with relevant projects such as EuropaBON, LIFE Integrated Projects and LIFE Strategic Nature Projects as well as with relevant projects under Horizon Europe topics, such as HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-02: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Collaboration with the European partnership on biodiversity Biodiversa+ should be explored, as needed.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-5, Understanding and reducing bycatch of protected species,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 9.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Birds, Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives and the common fisheries policy, as well as the ?Action plan to conserve fisheries resources and protect marine ecosystems?, projects? results will contribute to improving the monitoring and assessment of the impact of bycatch in different fishing gears on protected and sensitive species, including in protected areas, defining and implementing effective mitigation and management tools, based on up-to-date knowledge and solutions. They will contribute to the following impacts of destination ?Biodiversity and ecosystem services?: ?Understand and address direct drivers of biodiversity decline ? land and sea use change, natural resource use and exploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species ? as well as indirect drivers ? demographic, socio-economic, technological etc.? and ?Plan, manage and expand protected areas and improve the status of species and habitats based on up-to-date knowledge and solutions?.
Selected proposals are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
?	Elimination or significant reduction of bycatch is achieved for marine mammals (e.g., up to 8500 dolphins killed each year in the Bay of Biscay), sea turtles (currently ~70 000 killed each year in EU waters) and seabirds (currently ~200 000 killed each year in EU waters) and sensitive or endangered fish species (e.g. elasmobranchs and sturgeons).
?	Bycatch risks and reasons are well understood, including the spatial and temporal distribution of sensitive species.
?	Information needed to improve Member States? monitoring programmes and implementation of management actions is acquired.
?	Impacts of bycatches (rate of interactions, fate of individuals post-release, by gear and by fishery, impact on population abundance and sustainability) on the conservation status of species are assessed and understood.
?	Interactions of bycaught species with fishing gears are minimised and where possible eliminated, and mortality following interaction is reduced.
?	Member States are enabled to reach the target of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 to eliminate or reduce bycatch of sensitive species and to step up bycatch monitoring, as well as to fully and coherently implement the EU environmental and fisheries legislation and the Action plan to conserve fisheries resources and protect marine ecosystems and to protect marine ecosystems as required by the EU climate adaptation strategy.
?	Member States are enabled to set criteria for Good Environmental Status under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in relation to maintaining biodiversity and ensuring that all elements of marine food webs occur at normal abundance and diversity.
Scope: Proposals should work in one or more European regional seas and/or in other marine areas where EU fleet operates and should:
?	Evaluate bycatch risk on a sea basin and/or local level (in particular for marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and sensitive or endangered fish species such as e.g., elasmobranchs and sturgeons) by identifying the fishing activity of high-risk gear and comparing it with the spatial distribution/abundance of affected species, producing bycatch risk maps for all relevant species/gear interactions. Gather data and improve knowledge on the conservation status of bycaught species.
?	Develop or improve tools for monitoring of bycatch, including long-term observation and surveying programmes, e.g. through extending the use of remote electronic monitoring and artificial intelligence-based image recognition, enabling Member States to identify and implement adequate conservation measures as required by EU legislation.
?	Close the knowledge gaps on the locations, precise extent (number of individuals, season and locations) and reasons for bycatch (relevant metiers and fisheries), focusing on species threatened by extinction or in a bad conservation status.
?	Assess the effectiveness of existing bycatch mitigation methods (such as spatio-temporal closures or gear modifications) as well as of bycatch handling and safe release guidelines, and address their shortcomings, including through the development and testing of new approaches, focusing on high risk fisheries and most threatened species and areas.
?	Engage relevant stakeholders and environmental and fishing authorities and operators in the research projects promoting co-design in the development and testing of new approaches.
This topic is expected to contribute to the conservation of whales, whose role in carbon sequestration in the ocean is now thought to be important, therefore this topic will indirectly contribute to carbon sequestration.
Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for cooperation and networking activities. Proposals should build on existing relevant projects, including funded under Horizon 2020 and LIFE programme, as well as relevant work done by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and in Member States. They should also collaborate with Horizon Europe projects selected under topics on cumulative impact of stressors (i.e., HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-04: Assess and predict integrated impacts of cumulative direct and indirect stressors on coastal and marine biodiversity, ecosystems and their services) and marine/coastal observation & mapping (i.e., HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-01: Observing and mapping biodiversity and ecosystems, with particular focus on coastal and marine ecosystems). Additionally, they should collaborate with projects that will be funded under the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030.
Concrete efforts shall be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of projects are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly in the context of real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide ?FAIR-by-design? data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation.
International cooperation is encouraged, in particular with non-associated third countries participating in regional fisheries management organisations of EU interest.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project would consist in providing and analysing fisheries data as Member States upload some of the collected data to JRC databases.",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-6, Restoration of deep-sea habitats,3/28/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 10.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and, in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU proposal for a nature restoration law  and the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Regulation 734/2008 on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears, the climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, the project should contribute to the destination impacts of aiming at bringing back biodiversity on a path to recovery, and preserving and sustainably restoring ecosystems and their services, planning, managing and expanding protected areas, mainstreaming biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital in the society and the economy, and addressing direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity decline. They should provide public authorities, as well as operators in marine ecosystem restoration, with solutions to plan and upscale restoration operations of deep-sea habitats based on up-to-date knowledge and solutions.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better prioritisation of sites for active restoration in EU and Associated Countries seas and definition of ecosystem functioning restoration targets, considering short to long timescales, and taking into account impacts of climate and other abiotic changes;
?	Better decision making and contribution to policy formulation and implementation linked to protecting and restoring deep-sea marine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services and blueprints for the financing and the selection of tested active restoration approaches, tools and monitoring of their effects, taking into account cost-benefit analysis and integrating ecosystem services and natural capital accounting;
?	Advanced knowledge on deep-sea ecosystems adaptation and demonstrated innovative and technically challenging active restoration of deep-sea habitats for climate change adaptation and mitigation.
Scope: Marine ecosystems usually have long recovery times. Climate change is adding risk factors. Effects of passive restoration (protection measures) may take multiple decades before benefits may be felt. This is even more the case for deep-sea ecosystems. They have low energy density, slower biochemical processes and assemble species with long life cycle / span. Active restoration should be explored to help accelerate the restoration.
Proposals should build on and capitalise on the knowledge base developed and lessons learnt from the Horizon 2020 MERCES project, notably its census of European marine key habitats maps, degraded habitats maps, key habitats restoration potential and its trials on deep-sea restoration, as well as from other national or EU relevant past or ongoing projects in the field of deep-sea ecosystems exploration from Horizon 2020, EEA Grants and Horizon Europe (notably in topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-03 and HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-02).
The restoration activities should take place in areas with degraded habitats, and where protection measures against the causes of their degradation are already in place.
Proposals should develop and test innovative and technically challenging active restoration of deep-sea habitats. For this reason, and the cost of accessing the deep-sea, only one project may be funded with the budget available. Proposals should integrate different disciplines and novel approaches for the restoration that consider connectivity (including migratory species & vertical connections) in space and time, ecosystem modelling, as well as on site access, observation, and monitoring.
The restoration focus should not be only on species traits targets (population, assemblage, genetic diversity, sex determination, etc.), but also on ecosystem functions including adaptation potential. The proposals should include abiotic changes due to climate impact scenarios in identifying niche and refuge niche.
Proposals should set up governance frameworks for the restoration by involving local and national relevant actors (those having an impact on the achievement of the restoration goals, those having an interest and those who are impacted by related actions) to enable acceptability, ownership and a mechanism for long-term commitment to the restoration that exceed typical business and political cycles on financing, managing, regulating, monitoring and enforcement. Some short-term objectives are required to allow for measurements of restoration impacts in a reasonably shorter time frame to get on the right trajectory, but then check on mid- to long- term (5-20 years) should be planned.
Proposals should advance the knowledge base on the socio-economic costs and benefits of deep-sea restoration: including addressing the socio-economic importance of deep-sea ecosystems; considering upscaling issues and costs with restoration of deep-sea habitats, and timescales considerations.
Proposals should identify and test additional protection and management measures of the areas, to support the active restoration interventions over the long time, and provide recommendations for their application for new protected areas.
The proposals should contribute to filling the gaps in assessing deep-sea biodiversity recovery valuing changes in ecosystem goods and services; and contribute to define a natural capital accounting for deep-sea habitats.
The projects funded under this topic should build links with other relevant projects and initiatives such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects in the field of deep-sea ecosystems and with projects funded under the European Mission ?Restore our ocean and waters by 2030?, in particular with the Mission activities under objective 1 ? protect and restore marine ecosystems and their biodiversity, and with the Mission lighthouse activities and Blue Parks, as well as with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities. Proposals should outline a plan on how they intend to collaborate with other projects and initiatives, by e.g. participating in joint activities, workshops, common communication and dissemination activities, etc. Applicants should allocate the necessary budget to cover the plan. Relevant activities of the plan will be set out and carried out in close cooperation with relevant Commission services, ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes in integrating and coordinating these different scaled approaches, international cooperation is strongly encouraged. A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance. Actions under this topic will build upon and link with Horizon projects. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS, and European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet). Where relevant, creating links to and using the information and data of the European Earth observation programme Copernicus, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) is expected.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-7, Demonstration of marine and coastal infrastructures as hybrid blue-grey Nature-based Solutions,3/28/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and, in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU proposal for a nature restoration law  and the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, the new approach for a sustainable blue economy, the EU guidance document on integrating ecosystems and their services in decision-making, the projects should contribute to the destination impacts of mainstreaming biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital in the society and the economy, and addressing direct and indirect drivers of biodiversity decline. They should provide public authorities, as well as related infrastructures operators in their design, engineering, construction, installation and exploitation, with nature centred solutions that are beneficial for biodiversity, ecosystem services and the original infrastructure purpose (renewable energy production, or coastal protection).
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Pave the way for a new level of ecosystem-based management, in which future marine and coastal infrastructures (e.g., protection of coastal and urban areas from climate change impacts, offshore windfarms, harbours, tourism development, bridges, etc.) are intentionally designed and actively used to support the restoration (where the term encompasses multiple approaches to actively rehabilitate, repair, reallocate or reinvent damaged biodiversity and ecosystem processes and services) of marine ecosystem health and services (including climate mitigation & adaptation), where nature-based solutions alone cannot be envisaged;
?	Contribute to the development of a framework for ?blue buildings? rating based on the model of the LEED  (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) green building rating system;
?	Upscale Blueprints integrating the conception, installation, exploitation, maintenance of hybrid blue-grey infrastructures that are beneficial to ecosystem functioning and restoration;
?	Mainstream biodiversity in marine and coastal infrastructures and activities.
Scope: Climate policies trigger the development of several-large scale infrastructures in the marine and coastal environment. In particular, the EU offshore renewable energy plan targets for 40 GW of EU wave and tidal energy by 2050 from the 13 megawatts (MW) operating today. Climate adaptation and impacts reduction strategies imply the increase of an already important development of coastal and urban protection from erosion, sea level rise and extreme events. Global trade is supported by enlarging or building new ports. They may cause trade-offs against endemic biodiversity and alter on-going natural eco-evolutionary responses. They may cause trade-offs against endemic biodiversity and ecology, but they could protect, restore or harbour functional ecosystems (even if mostly novel) providing critical functions and services opportunities to biodiversity by mimicking and integrating natural processes and features in their design.
Proposals should be large scale demonstration of hybrid nature-based solutions with built coastal and marine infrastructures to preserve ecosystems and/or support their restoration. The infrastructure purpose should be originally aiming at climate policy targets (e.g., hard and soft coastal or urban protection from climate change impacts ? sea level rise, extreme events, erosion - , renewable energy farms or islands, maritime services and safety, etc.) and with the highest potential for being replicated, scaled-up and deployed. Proposals should also assess the putative impacts/secondary effects of these infrastructures, notably regarding cumulative impacts of the biodiversity drivers such as climate, land and sea-use change (infrastructures), invasive alien species, etc. The action should consider impacts and opportunities from ecological connectivity with neighbouring ecosystems.
Proposals looking at infrastructures serving several purposes (such as Low Trophic Aquaculture; educational and recreational purposes; support of fishery via creation of nursery habitats; bio filtration and bio depollution) are encouraged. Proposals should integrate the relevant results of other Horizon 2020 or national projects on multi-use of the marine space.
Proposals should look how nature benefits could be put at the centre of the infrastructures by addressing the selection or the development of materials for their construction, design, installation, and maintenance, to maximise the positive effects on natural processes and enable their preservation (if in good status) or restoration of the local marine ecosystems and their socio-ecological management.
Proposals should explore and improve co-creation approaches with the relevant actors (infrastructure owners, governance, civil society and end-users or beneficiaries) for the design, installation and management of these built infrastructures with nature centred design. Social innovation is recommended when the solutions are at the socio-technical interface and require social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake. Proposals should provide evidence and data of the multiple benefits and potential trade-offs of these hybrid solutions on short and long-term timescales and, in particular, for the purposes of marine biodiversity and ecosystems functions protection and restoration, but also for the blue economy and society as a whole.
In particular, for hybrid infrastructures aiming at protection against climate impacts, the proposals should provide evidence-based analysis of their efficiency compared to more usual infrastructure approaches, and to usual nature-based solutions, or as alternatives where ?NBS alone? cannot be envisaged due to local environmental features. The projects funded under this topic should build links with projects funded under the European Mission ?Restore our ocean and waters by 2030?, in particular with the Mission activities under objective 1 ? protect and restore marine ecosystems and their biodiversity, and with the Mission lighthouse activities and Blue Parks as well as with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform for reporting, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities. Proposals should also connect with relevant projects under Horizon Europe topics, such as (HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03), on support of development of policies, business models and market conditions to scale up and speed up the implementation of nature-based solutions.
Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative  by interacting with the NEB Community, NEBLab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practices, and, where relevant, results.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes in integrating and coordinating these different scaled approaches, international cooperation is strongly encouraged. A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance. Actions under this topic will build upon and link with Horizon projects. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS, and EMODnet).

HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-8, Addressing biodiversity decline and promoting Nature-based Solutions in higher education,3/28/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic aims to contribute to education, skills development and awareness raising about biodiversity loss, and how this can be addressed, notably with Nature-based Solutions (NBS), in the higher education sector. This is fundamental to further implement and upscale NBS and to mainstreaming biodiversity, ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, climate resilience and pollution reduction, and natural capital in the society and economy. Through education and NBS, the topic contributes to the transformative change necessary to tackle societal challenges, notably addressing the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU climate adaptation strategy.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved and more coordinated education programmes and increased awareness about biodiversity loss and how this can be addressed together with climate change notably through NBS, in universities and technical schools.
?	Increased awareness and development of skills among young people, teachers, professional organisations, on biodiversity, climate change and NBS.
?	A transdisciplinary dialogue on inclusive NBS contributing to nature-based thinking and a nature-positive economy, drawing on inclusiveness, the pluralities of values and of knowledge.
?	A sustainable recovery of society and the necessary transformative change through biodiversity-friendly actions, professional, collective and personal attitudes.
Scope: The European Green Deal communication puts forward a specific action for the Commission to prepare a European competence framework to help develop and assess knowledge, skills and attitudes on climate change and sustainable development. This competence framework should serve as a reference tool for the development and assessment of competences on environmental sustainability. Following the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Commission proposed in 2022 a Council Recommendation on encouraging cooperation in learning for environmental sustainability, including biodiversity learning and teaching, which was accompanied by a competence framework.
Education plays indeed an essential role in addressing environmental sustainability by raising awareness and instilling the key competences needed for changing personal behaviours and empowering people to act in their respective communities, especially in the current context of economic recovery, biodiversity crisis and climate change.
Drawing on state-of-the-art science, including the results of EU-funded R&I projects on biodiversity and NBS, the selected project will develop and disseminate concrete guidance for higher education institutions. It will target vocational training, universities and technical schools, for greater involvement with citizens and professional organisations, to mainstream biodiversity and NBS into their learning, teaching and capacity building programmes.
Transdisciplinary collaboration is a fundamental prerequisite for mutual understanding of people working in different sectors when co-creating and co-implementing NBS. There is a need to go beyond tackling challenges individually and perceive the systemic complexity of challenges to be addressed by NBS, by working together across silos, sectors and epistemologies. This paradigm shift in education and skills development will contribute to the necessary transdisciplinary work for tackling both biodiversity and climate crises at different decision-making scales.
The successful proposals should:
?	Develop networking and collaboration schemes on higher education curricula and programmes on NBS, as well as researcher mobility initiatives.
?	Support and promote the teaching of NBS co-design and co-creation (considering biodiversity and ecosystem services as their fundamental building blocks) as part of high education degrees and further education qualifications. Explore ways of raising awareness and teaching the importance of biodiversity, including genetic, functional and taxonomic diversity, and ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, climate resilience and pollution reduction, especially in those academic fields where this is still greatly lacking (e.g., economics, engineering, etc).
?	Encourage holistic approaches centred on biodiversity and the interlinks with climate change; and assess and propose university curricula for NBS-related disciplines, as well as for universities of technology, engineering and other non-biodiversity focused studies that are relevant for NBS design, implementation, monitoring and maintenance.
?	Develop collaboration, guidance, benchmarking and exchange of best practices on how the higher education sector can address its impacts on biodiversity when addressing climate change (e.g., in built infrastructure, consumption and other processes), including through NBS.
?	Explore innovative ways of involving higher education institutions, their students and staff in tackling the biodiversity crisis, together with the climate crisis (e.g., through documentaries, awards, art interventions, campus improvements).
?	Develop NBS capacity building and skills development programmes, in different EU official languages and knowledge transfer mechanisms, in coordination with the relevant professional organisations and building on the work developed on NBS standards and protocols, e.g. by the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe NBS project portfolio, or by the IUCN, so that new technical solutions and standards are used in the NBS supply market.
?	In view of a just ecological transition, provide specific NBS vocational training and skills development programmes for the youth, long term unemployed or other social groups in need (including in most deprived regions), co-developed with the relevant professional training and social inclusion institutions.
?	Explore innovative ways of ensuring a transdisciplinary dialogue on biodiversity, drivers of biodiversity change, climate and NBS among communities of practice and professional organisations, as well as in universities. In this respect, develop approaches to ensure the quality of transdisciplinary programmes and provide an innovative dialogue space ensuring transdisciplinarity and welcoming the pluralities of values and knowledge, in view of transformative change to tackle both climate and biodiversity crises.
?	Outreach and cooperation activities between higher education institutions and citizens, the local and regional communities, businesses, research centres, or museums, supporting challenge-based and experiential learning with real-life applications, promoting nature-based thinking, public debate and a change of behaviour.
?	Organise academic residences or summer schools with the relevant partners in Member States, where students can join interdisciplinary and multicultural discussions and witness, in person, the co-creation, co-implementation and co-monitoring of NBS, also in view of emancipatory action for transformative change.
Proposals should address all of the above points.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. In particular, SSH should be involved in view of ensuring the understanding and inclusion of different values and perceptions of nature, biodiversity and NBS, as well as issues of knowledge creation, identity and culture shaping NBS co-creation and co-implementation.
Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources to collaborate with other projects selected in any other relevant topic, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination. In particular, the project should build on the existing outputs and create synergies with the relevant projects in Erasmus+, the Horizon Europe Missions (notably ?Restore Our Ocean and Waters by 2030? and ""Adaptation to climate Change?), as well as the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio and its task forces. The project should also foresee synergies with HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03: Network for nature: multi-stakeholder dialogue platform to promote nature-based solutions; with the HORIZON-CL6-2021-COMMUNITIES-01-06: Inside and outside: educational innovation with nature-based solutions; and HORIZON-CL5-2023-D1-01-10: Improving the evidence base regarding the impact of sustainability and climate change education and related learning outcomes. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities without the prerequisite to define concrete common actions at this stage.
Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outputs are accessible through the Oppla portal (the EU repository for NBS).",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-9," Biodiversity, economics and finance:  unlocking financial flows towards reversing of biodiversity loss",3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities and in particular with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the 2030 climate target plan, the successful proposal will help unlock financial flows needed for reversing biodiversity loss and help better implement the sustainable finance taxonomy, thus contributing to mainstream biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital in the society and economy and to build approaches for enabling transformative changes to face societal challenges, including through the deployment of nature-based solutions (NBS).
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Mobilisation of mainstream finance to slow down, and reverse biodiversity loss in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development, by catalysing nature-positive investments such as nature-based solutions, and by promoting a more holistic approach that considers nature?s essential contributions to other objectives such as those related to climate, health, food, and water security;
?	New knowledge, methodologies, and tools to support the implementation of the EU strategy for financing the transition to a sustainable economy, with a view to reorienting financial flows towards activities that benefit protection, restoration and sustainable management and use of biodiversity and ecosystems, including information, tools, and metrics to better integrate biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital considerations in their decision-making processes;
?	Better awareness, understanding and know-how of economic actors, the financial community, and key institutions, public and private, about the opportunities and barriers (knowledge gaps, skills gaps, etc.) associated with the implementation of the sustainable finance taxonomy  , including its technical screening criteria  and ?Do No Significant Harm? (DNSH) principle in regard of the environmental objective focusing on the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems
?	Contribution to the implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 by helping to put Europe?s biodiversity on the path to recovery by 2030 for the benefit of people, climate, and the planet and by better measurement, monitoring, and management of biodiversity.
Scope: Nature provides all sorts of essential services to our societies: clean air and water, food, pollination, carbon sequestration and pollination, it sustains tourism and leisure activities, it contributes to mental and physical health and delivers many other functions. In many instances, nature is also the most effective insurance policy ? protecting us from floods, landslides, fires, or extreme heat.
However, we are facing an unprecedented crisis of biodiversity loss, posing a serious threat to our future welfare. 75% of the land-based environment and about 66% of the marine environment have been significantly altered by human actions. Nearly 1 million species are at risk of extinction from human activities. The loss of clean air, drinkable water, pollinating insects, forests, and species pose as big a threat to species survival as climate change. The loss of biodiversity increases the challenge of limiting climate change, as healthy ecosystems naturally absorb carbon from the atmosphere.
At the same time, Research findings  indicate that the conservation and effective management and guardianship of at least 30% of the planet in the most important places for biodiversity could protect up to 80% of plant and animal species, and secure 60% of the planet?s carbon stocks and 66% of the planet?s clean water. The latest IPCC report complements this statement: conservation of approximately 30% to 50% of the planet will also be key in maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale. UNEP report on the State of Finance for Nature  states that investments in NBS need to triple by 2030 and to quadruple by 2050  if the world is to meet its climate change, biodiversity and land restoration targets. As underlined in the same report, more research is needed on how private financing can be strengthened and what are the low-hanging investment opportunities.
The EU sustainable finance taxonomy and other similar initiatives are underway with the aim to help guide investments towards more sustainable outcomes, in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal. They constitute a unique opportunity for ramping up investments in natural capital and projects that substantially contribute to biodiversity, as well as to other challenges, such as nature-based solutions and ecosystem restoration contributing to climate mitigation and adaptation.
Mobilising private investment, in particular to support the scaling up of NBS and the market for NBS in the European Union is key, in the context of a market characterised by smaller scale projects predominantly grants funded by the public sector.
The project(s) should:
?	Co-identify, analyse, and explore solutions to address potential barriers and hurdles in the implementation of the Taxonomy Regulation, for example related to the interpretation and the collection of data for biodiversity relevant technical screening criteria. The project(s) could address the technical criteria ?Substantially Contribute? to climate change mitigation and adaptation while following the ?Do No Significantly Does Harm? in terms of the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem; as well as the criteria ?Substantially Contribute? to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem, especially for activities related to land management, restoration of ecosystems and remediation;
?	More particularly, identify for which criteria/sectors there are practical implementation barriers and gaps, for example through analysis of case studies, when collecting the remaining Research and Innovation gaps;
?	Building on the existing community's engagement in relevant Horizon 2020 and LIFE projects , engage the relevant stakeholders from the financial and biodiversity and NBS community involved in the implementation of the regulations in this analysis, and in the exploration and co-development of solutions in order to close the implementation gaps. This includes for example academics, regulatory bodies, financial institutions, civil society, industry and NGOs having co-developed relevant standards, protocols and certification schemes;
?	Analyse the investment landscape in relation to protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, identifying best-practice case studies and evaluating the leverage potential of the EU taxonomy and its key success factors. Explore pathways for the future development of the taxonomy that could generate the most positive biodiversity outcomes;
?	Provide the necessary guidance, training, and tools both for financial entities and for entrepreneurs engaged in ?nature positive? activities, for the interpretation and collection of data of the technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity substantially contribute (SC) to one or more objectives, as set in the Regulation. It should also guide the interpretation of the technical screening criteria for determining whether an economic activity does significant harm (in relation to the DNSH principle) to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems, as set in the Regulations. This should support compliance with related reporting and disclosure regulations;
?	Identify potential skill gaps and propose a capacity building strategy to tackle them;
?	Provide economic actors such as investors including Investment Fund Managers, corporates and financial institutions with tools, guidance, and methodologies to gather reliable, consistent and standardised data to enable incorporation of biodiversity considerations into their investment decisions and risk management processes;
?	Involve actively and co-create with the end-users and stakeholders (non-financial corporations, financial institutions, governments etc.) to fully account for their respective views and needs;
?	Issue recommendations at EU as well as other levels on enabling conditions for biodiversity-focused sustainable finance and accounting principles, exploring synergies with other EU initiatives, such as the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)  and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive , as well as with relevant ?biodiversity-friendly? labels and standards.
Actions should bring together from the start multiple types of scientific expertise in social sciences and humanities, in particular in economics and finance, as well as scientific expertise in biodiversity and natural capital.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with the project(s) of the same topic and relevant topics on sustainable finance and valuation of ecosystem services . To this end proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, foresee joint activities and joint deliverables",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-10, Build up of knowledge on Nature Positive Economy and supporting its scale-up,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, in particular the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the revised climate targets, the successful proposal will support the development of policies and market conditions to scale up and accelerate the implementation of nature positive economic activities with particular focus on Nature-based Solutions (NBS). It will promote mainstreaming of biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital valuation in the society and economy.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased clarity of concepts around nature positive economy and its components, with better understanding of the synergies and trade-offs with other sustainable economic activities, such as a circular and sustainable bioeconomy , and the interactions with the EU sustainable finance taxonomy;
?	New knowledge and increased expertise of relevant stakeholders in both public and private sectors, including economic and financial decision makers, on the market and determinants of nature positive activities with NBS at the core;
?	Creation of an EU community of ?nature-based enterprises? as a basis for promoting EU global leadership;
?	New enabling policy, regulations, support, tools, and capacity building measures, addressing market barriers, and leading towards better integration of innovative nature-based entrepreneurship and nature-based solutions in the current economic and financial system;
?	Support to the implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the new EU climate adaptation strategy, the new EU sustainable finance strategy, and increased synergies with other key policy areas in support of European Green Deal priorities.
Scope: The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 states that ?industry and business have an impact on nature, but they also produce the important innovations, partnerships and expertise that can help address biodiversity loss?. From the perspective of the private sector, integrating natural capital and biodiversity considerations into their decision-making processes makes economic sense as it can enhance corporate resilience and minimise investment risks. At the same time, economic activities that aim at reversing of biodiversity loss can create positive outcomes for the society such as job creation and sustainable economic growth in rural, post-industrial and disadvantaged areas and strengthen resilience against environmental and climate stressors, contributing to a fair and green transition and recovery in line with the European Green Deal. According to the World Economic Forum, a nature-positive recovery ?can unlock an estimated $10 trillion of business opportunity by transforming three economic ecosystems that are responsible for almost 80% of nature loss and create 395 million resilient jobs by 2030 in the process? .
Nature-based solutions (NBS) can play a particularly key role in leveraging of the economic and societal potential of nature with the development of existing and new market sectors with ?nature-based enterprises? (NBEs) at the core. Such innovative NBEs use nature (and ecosystem services) as an input to deliver nature positive outputs - products, services and jobs that are sustainable, future-oriented, and more resilient. By definition, they constitute a backbone of the bioeconomy.
However, nature-positive economy where such NBEs can thrive is still at its infancy and enabling framework conditions are required to improve market conditions and to unlock investment. The market is encountering many specific difficulties due to market fragmentation, early stage of development and difficulty in assembling the required knowledge, skillset, and governance structures for supplying and maintaining ?living solutions? such as nature-based solutions. There is a need at the same time to increase manyfold the investment in NBS .
The action should:
?	On Concept: Undertake in-depth research into the key concepts underpinning nature positive economy, establishing synergies and trade-offs with other policies, strategies, and business models such as bioeconomy related, and exploring the role of nature positive activities and NBS in promoting transformative change to provide holistic solutions that address global challenges such as climate, biodiversity, and pollution crisis;
?	On Market Knowledge: Building on the work of Horizon 2020 projects and their taskforces, identify barriers and analyse market potential in different economic sectors, at European and national level when possible, for each sector, identify the stakeholders of the different value chains for the different types of nature positive economic activities, estimating the net job creation potential with a view to supporting the framing of nature positive economy narrative. This work should include identification and analysis of representative case studies and reflections on positioning towards nature positive economic activities as defined by the Sustainable Finance Taxonomy ;
?	Foster collaboration between nature-based entrepreneurs, research and technical organisations, policy makers, financiers and investors, business development bodies through, for example, participatory arrangements and spaces, to close the Science Policy Implementation gap;
?	On Indicators: Building on previous research, notably natural capital valuation methods including both monetary and non-monetary economic valuation approaches for nature-based solutions , deliver progress towards standardised, widely accepted economic indicators, reflecting wider socio-economic, biodiversity and natural capital benefits;
?	On Market development: using the collaborative and participatory arrangements, develop and pilot strategies, measures (both market and non-market) and approaches for scaling and speeding up the implementation of nature positive economic activities, including Nature-based Solutions (NBS), both from supply and demand side perspective to boost nature-based market development, innovation, and job creation in EU and beyond. This may comprise for market supply economic, finance and governance innovations, capacity building and training;
?	Explore and facilitate synergies and interconnection with different EU, MS and Horizon Europe Associated Countries initiatives, such as: EU and national Business and Biodiversity platforms, national restoration plans, Business Acceleration Services, Climate KIC, Smart Specialisation Strategies, Recovery Plans, the EU Biodiversity Partnership, Circular Bio-based Europe Partnership, European Bioeconomy Policy Forum, for more coordinated actions and aggregated impact on NBS and nature positive activities;
?	Set up and/or collaborate with relevant marketplaces and similar initiatives at the relevant scales, so that potential project partners, entrepreneurs, investors, and innovation stakeholders can match supply, demand and expertise on designing, implementing, managing, monitoring, valuing, financing NBS, ecosystem services and nature positive activities;
?	On Standardisation: support the engagement of the relevant communities (including the communities engaged in the relevant Horizon 2020, Horizon Europe and LIFE projects) in contributing to the development of sector-specific standards and/or certification schemes;
?	Build on and/or establish synergies with the relevant work by initiatives/projects/studies including, but not limited to the EIB led study on facilitating access to finance for Nature-based solutions, the EC publication ?The vital role of NBS in the Nature-Positive Economy? , the World Economic Forum?s New Nature Economy Report Series, The Economics of Biodiversity: The Dasgupta Review, The State of Finance for Nature 2021 ;
?	Actions should bring together from the start multiple types of scientific expertise in social sciences and humanities, in particular in economics and finance, as well as scientific expertise in biodiversity and natural capital.
Other conditions:
Actions should envisage clustering activities with the projects with the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe Natural Capital Accounting and NBS project portfolio and respective task forces as well as any Horizon Europe relevant projects on NBS  and Bioeconomy. To this end proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, foresee joint activities and joint deliverables",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-11, Biodiversity loss and enhancing ecosystem services in urban and peri-urban areas,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal, in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU proposal for a nature restoration law , projects will contribute to the following impact: ?to mainstream biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital in the society and economy?.
They should address all of the following outcomes:
?	Better implementation and delivery of the EU proposal for a nature restoration law and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, particularly through new resources and knowledge to support the deployment across EU of urban (and peri-urban) greening plans;
?	Increased capacity and skills in cities to work ?at the right scale? of the challenge and across policies, measures, strategies, including spatial planning capacity, so as to help deliver and assess the urban greening plans, green infrastructure strategies and more widely transformative change towards more sustainable and resilient cities to implement the EU climate adaptation strategy;
?	Better understanding on how and under which conditions spatial planning can help optimise the ecosystem services of the solutions, strategies and actions, such as ecosystem restoration/creation and connectivity, Nature-based Solutions (NBS), blue and green infrastructure while addressing social equity and spatial justice aspects; operating this new knowledge into new pathways and methodologies;
?	New tools and solutions for better integration of nature-based objectives in investments in infrastructure and other urban systems as well as better investment cases for renaturing the urban and peri-urban areas and maintain NBS in the long-term thanks to new and innovative governance and finance models;
?	Better understanding on how to manage the tension between biodiversity protection, urban development pressure and fair access to nature for the urban citizen, identifying the relevant scale and timeframe while considering the long-term impact of spatial planning strategies;
?	New approaches, tools and good practices for decision-making processes supporting municipal planning structures in co-creation of policies and plans for NBS through the lens of social equity and environmental fairness.
Scope: Cities with their peri-urban areas have a vital role in protecting and enhancing nature and nature contribution to people in urban areas across EU, such as health, well-being, and climate resilience. They are also key in delivering global and EU biodiversity objectives and policies, as recognised both in the ?post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) Draft 1?  and in the ?EU biodiversity strategy for 2030? , as well as in the proposal for a nature restoration law  which sets targets for urban and peri-urban ecosystems.
Cities are at the same time pledging for a recognition of their pivotal role(s) in delivering an ambitious GBF, with more than 200 sub-national authorities having signed the Edinburgh Declaration : as decision makers and regulators for land-use and urban development through their statutory role in spatial planning; as land and infrastructure (grey and green) owner, manager or shareholders, such as brownfields and public spaces, including natural and protected areas; as co- initiators and co-funders of local green initiatives, from urban gardening to depaving doorsteps and to the implementation of large-scale NBS.
There is however a lack of knowledge and know-how on:
?	how to assess ecosystem condition and services in urban and peri-urban areas, and their contribution to the challenges of the cities,
?	how to best plan and prioritise the protection, renaturing, and reconnecting of the NBS and green and blue infrastructure so as to optimise the ecosystem services and address the policy priorities of the city while ?leaving no one behind? as stressed by the European Green deal (e.g., promote urban and regional resilience, while addressing spatial justice to avoid increased inequality),
?	how to combine, connect and manage different re-naturing actions and interventions and the scales of these actions- from an individual intervention to an urban and functional urban area in order to minimise the trade-offs and disservices and optimise the benefits in a cost effective and efficient manner.
The successful proposal should:
?	Building on the work of Horizon 2020 projects and their task forces, take stock of the state the existing urban and peri-urban ecosystems and their services and identify direct (urban development pressure etc.) and indirect drivers of loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services at local level (policy, spatial regulations, financial incentives, land management practices, etc.);
?	Develop a replicable methodology for cities and urban areas across Europe to co-design pathways, a shared long-term vision, an integrated strategy with policies and an action plan (e.g., with responsibilities, timeline and financing) towards the urban ecosystem restoration targets as formulated in the Commission proposal for a nature restoration law ;
?	Include in the methodology the necessary mapping and assessment methods, economic and co-creation governance models to co-develop and prioritise i. combination of cost effective and efficient solutions that will enable to co-implement the strategy and to co-monitor the delivery; ii. innovative solutions and governance models to integrate systematically the strategies in the public, private and people decision making processes, such as public procurement, transport and climate policies, spatial regulations, land management decision, market incentives, etc; iii. innovative financing and business models;
?	Co-develop and test the methodology in a representative sample of cities across EU with local stakeholders from the whole society that will enable the uptake of the models and tools developed across EU and EU regions, thus supporting EU territorial cohesion;
?	Engage in the testing cities different departments of local authorities, local research and technical organisations, big urban/ land managers or users, including farmers, citizen, including vulnerable groups, SMEs such as nature-based enterprises, etc. Citizen science approach could be used for this purpose;
?	Identify the skills and building capacity needs at the local and regional levels, the potential for job creation as well as existing capacity building programmes, with an eye at the inclusion of marginalised communities and at the gender dimension;
?	Propose how urban greening plans and spatial planning, including regulations and building code, can act as enablers of the development of NBS market;
?	Disseminate outcomes and capacity building activities across EU, connecting with the relevant platforms such as recommended in the EU guidance for urban greening plans, as well as with the ?Cities with nature platform? ;
Proposals should also:
?	Build on existing methods and data from the Urban Greening Plan guidance and toolbox, including JRC MAES urban, EPSON studies, EEA data on green infrastructure;
?	Build on the outcomes of the relevant EU-funded projects of the Horizon 2020 and LIFE Programmes , including further testing and developing of the EU Impact Evaluation Framework for NBS  and similar highly relevant protocols and guidelines;
?	Envisage clustering activities with the relevant Horizon 2020 NBS projects and respective task forces as well as with relevant Horizon Europe projects  and relevant successful projects resulting from calls of the EU Missions ?Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities? and ?Adaptation to Climate Change?;
?	The use of social science and humanities methods and of social innovation is encouraged to encounter also different perceptions, values, experiences, practices, and social production across all stages of urban planning and to contribute to the empowerment of citizens.",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-12, Reinforcing science policy support with IPBES and IPCC for better interconnected biodiversity and climate policies,3/28/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 4.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the Commission priority 'A stronger Europe in the world', a successful proposal will step up EU science policy support to biodiversity policy at EU and international level, and in particular the interconnections with climate policies . This will require the contribution to processes triggered by the EU and global biodiversity knowledge centres, IPBES and IPCC to achieve targeted impacts on biodiversity-relevant policies, and to integrate structured policy input into the research cycle. Projects should deliver the following outcomes:
?	EU projects and initiatives are aware of and use the knowledge generation, policy support and capacity building functions of IPBES, including the recommendations issued by task forces of IPBES and IPCC (where relevant for biodiversity);
?	Contribution of and uptake by research projects and initiatives reinforcing the evidence base of EU biodiversity and climate policy by promoting synergies and avoiding conflicts, as well as taking into account the knowledge generation, policy support and capacity building functions of IPBES, in line with the recommendations issued by the task forces of IPBES and IPCC;
?	Address shortcomings in the uptake of IPBES and IPCC findings and conclusions in sectorial policy making other than for biodiversity, and business decisions at European, national and local level;
?	Better support from EU research for policy requests to the EU and global Knowledge Centres for Biodiversity and to the European contribution to IPBES.
Scope: In line with the Commission?s priority 'A stronger Europe in the world', the European Union must take and demonstrate leadership in this field, notably by increasing its support to the EU and global biodiversity knowledge centres  and to IPBES ? and to elevate it to the same level as the IPCC.
?	Besides economic support, this also includes networking efforts to reinforce synergies and cooperation of the work of EU services, scientists and practitioners with CBD, IPBES, regional Multilateral Environmental Agreements, UN organisations and programmes, and other relevant research communities to underpin the implementation, monitoring and review of the post 2020 global biodiversity framework.
?	This action delivers targeted support to areas of specific interest for European research policy by using as well as contributing to IPBES outputs. It also helps European scientists, in particular those from southern, central and eastern EU countries, and those from the Western Balkans, Central Asia, and from Africa , who remain underrepresented, due to a lack of capacity to participate in meetings, networking or science input at global level, to play their role by contributing to EU and global regular assessments (EU ecosystem assessment, IPBES global assessments, Gap and Stocktake Reports, global biodiversity outlook). Major functions of IPBES still need to be further developed to achieve a proper level of uptake in Europe: knowledge generation, policy support and capacity building functions, including the task forces.
The project should cover all of the following points:
?	providing assistance to the EU and Associated Countries, to central Asian and to African scientists, knowledge holders and local communities for reinforcing the input into the EU and global biodiversity knowledge centres, IPBES and IPCC on biodiversity;
?	translating IPBES and other relevant research outputs for policy and decision-making into a language targeted to a wider readership by the EU public, interest groups, research and innovation projects, policy makers and businesses, and into (a set of) EU languages;
?	networking and facilitating synergies through cooperation between IPBES, IPCC and amongst scientists and relevant scientific bodies of other regional Multilateral Environment Agreements, such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Air Convention;
?	proposing standards for EU-funded biodiversity projects to apply the relevant outcomes of the IPBES data and knowledge task force;
?	supporting European negotiators at IPBES plenary meetings and inter-sessional work as well as at the scientific body meetings of CBD and other biodiversity-related MEAs of relevance to IPBES. This includes back-office support to the EU IPBES and IPCC negotiation teams and to delegations of Member States and Associated Countries in need of assistance in synthesizing scientific evidence of relevance for IPBES and IPCC plenary work.
The project should detail a plan on how the work can be further financed and governed over the medium- and long-term and secure commitments that enable the work to continue after the funding of this topic ends.
Proposals should not develop any new platforms but ensure that all relevant evidence, data and information is accessible through e.g., the Oppla portal and cooperate with existing networks of national platforms . They should also prepare the inclusion of their results in the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity, hosted by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), according to an agreed format, and cooperate with the Science Service project ?Bio-Agora?.
The project is to set a clear plan on how it will collaborate with other projects selected under related topics of the Cluster 6 Work Programmes 2021-245, and with the Biodiversity Partnership Biodiversa+. This includes links to ESFRI research infrastructures, to test whether they could host predictive models, visualization and analysis of their platform's early warning systems, to respond to IPBES and IPCC assessments and to CBD requests, by participating in joint activities such as workshops, scientific deliverables, or joint communication and dissemination measures. Proposals should include dedicated tasks and allocate sufficient resources for coordination measures and indicate the necessary flexibility to react to requests stemming from future IPBES and IPCC work programme development.
Proposals should involve the contribution from the social sciences and humanities disciplines",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-13, Crop wild relatives for sustainable agriculture,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Activities under this topic seek to preserve biodiversity and thereby contribute to the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the upcoming post 2020 global biodiversity framework. By increasing agrobiodiversity, activities will contribute to food security, adaptation of the agricultural production to the effects of climate change, and thereby support implementation of the farm to fork strategy, the common agricultural policy and the EU climate policy under the European Green Deal.
Projects funded under this topic are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	More effectiveness measures for the conservation of Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) due to increased knowledge and systematic monitoring and documentation of the diversity, the threats and the conservation status of CWR;
?	Conservation of CWR is improved due to a) better coverage of CWR in gene banks, b) the establishment of genetic reserves for in situ conservation, and c) enhanced genetic characterisation of CWRs;
?	Knowledge on valuable traits, such as tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses or nutritional properties is more easily available to breeders and accelerates the breeding of more resilient crop varieties;
?	Greater use of CWR in pre-breeding and breeding activities, both in formal and on-farm crop improvement programmes;
?	Farmers are more aware of the value of CWRs and have improved access to varieties and cultivars with high resilience and/or adapted to marginal lands.
Scope: Crop Wild Relatives (CWR) ? also referred to as the wild cousins of cultivated crops - are a key asset for agrobiodiversity, sustainable agriculture and food security overall. CRWs contain genes for a multitude of useful traits such as tolerance to pest and diseases, resource efficiency and adaptability to more extreme weather conditions or nutritional quality. Their inherent genetic diversity together with the associated diversity of microbiota is a vast resource for developing more productive, nutritious and resilient crop varieties and for diversifying farming systems.
Despite their value, a wide range of CWRs are threatened and face pressures, e.g., from intensive agriculture, urbanisation, pollution and the effects of climate change. At the same time, the conservation and use of CWRs in breeding lags significantly behind the one of main crops. It is estimated that for about 30% taxa associated with 63 crops, no germplasm accessions exist and that about 95% of CWR taxa are underrepresented in genetic resources collections. As a consequence, knowledge is lacking about the diversity that exists and precisely how that diversity may be used for crop improvement and in farming.
More systematic efforts are needed to improve the conservation of CWR in ?situ and ex-situ and increase their use in plant breeding and farming.
Proposals should:
?	review and increase our knowledge on the diversity, the conservation status (both in situ and ex situ), the threats, monitoring and the utilization of CWR in Europe; due account should be taken of the local knowledge of farmers, e.g., as regards the specific attributes of CWR resources, their integration in agro-ecosystems and methods for their management on-farm;
?	promote the breath of taxa and genetic diversity of CWR in gene bank collections and improve their description and geno- and phenotypic characterisation;
?	set-up pilots of genetic reserves for CWR under different types of management regimes and pedo-climatic conditions, and develop models for their long-term viability;
?	unravel the genetic basis of valuable traits of CWR such as the resilience to different biotic and abiotic stresses or nutritional quality;
?	develop high-quality genomic resources to promote the use of CWR in pre-breeding and breeding activities of formal and on-farm crop improvement programmes;
?	promote the on-farm management and conservation of CRW genetic resources taking into account the adaptation of CWR to local conditions;
?	carry out training activities and increase awareness of breeders, farmers, consumers and the various actors in value chains (e.g., the agri-food industry) about the value of CWR, including by carrying out on-farm demonstrations.
Work under this topic should be carried out in various pedo-climatic zones  and benefit both conventional and organic farming as reflected in the expertise of the consortia. Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach?, and build partnerships across research, conservation, breeding, farming and business sectors, considering a balanced representation of partners from within the EU and Associated Countries. They should also demonstrate a sound representation of SSH disciplines",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-14, Biodiversity friendly practices in agriculture ? breeding for Integrated Pest Management (IPM),3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the EU Climate Policy, EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the farm to fork strategy, a successful proposal will contribute to the transition to more sustainable practices in agriculture by reducing the need for external inputs, notably chemical pesticides , and support biodiversity in agroecosystems.
Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Enhanced knowledge of relevant traits for resistance and/or tolerance (resilience) to biotic stresses;
?	Enlarged availability and access to plant varieties which can better cope with increased pest and diseases pressure;
?	Increased knowledge, knowledge transfer, and capacity of farmers and agricultural advisers to implement Integrated Pest Management with plant varieties that can better cope with plant pests and that are adapted to the local environmental and pedo-climatic conditions (e.g., terroir effects, soil health status, local disease pressures, positive interactions with biological control) and farming practices (e.g., intercropping, crop rotation, carbon farming).
Scope: The European Green Deal has set ambitious targets to reduce by 2030 the use and the risk of chemical pesticides and fertilisers, reduce nutrient losses and increase organic farming . Plant breeders need to consider more systematically characteristics that respond to these demands and contribute to crop resilience and adaptation, particularly to increasing biotic and abiotic stresses, in particular in the context of climate change.
Breeding for integrated pest management (IPM) aims to boost the development of plant varieties with tolerance of or resistance to relevant pest(s)  and diseases, adapted to local environmental and pedo-climatic conditions, and diversification approaches with the goal of reducing reliance on chemical pesticides.
Proposals should:
?	Contribute to a better understanding of crop-specific genetic characteristics and crop-environment management (GxExM) interactions underpinning tolerance to pest pressure;
?	Identify useful traits/combination of traits and progress in the development of plant varieties with increased resistance or tolerance to plant pests and adapted to local conditions;
?	Embark in breeding activities for pest-tolerant or pest-resistant varieties making use of all type of breeding approaches and allow for participatory breeding with involvement of farmers;
?	Promote the deployment of resistant plant varieties in combination with the range of tools available for integrated pest management such as crop diversification, soil and crop management (e.g., crop residue management), biological control agents (e.g., micro- and macro-organisms), the preservation and enhancement of natural enemies of plant pests (e.g., beneficial insects/mites/nematodes/antagonistic, symbiont microorganisms, beneficial endophytes);
?	Support capacity building, training and education enabling farmers/growers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices in pest management following the integration of tolerant plant varieties;

HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-15, Integrative forest management for multiple ecosystem services and enhanced biodiversity,3/28/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal, EU climate policy, and the EU forest and biodiversity strategies, this topic promotes research-based and evidence-based forest conservation and management approaches that apply an understanding of the structure, function, and dynamics of natural and sustainably managed forest ecosystems to achieve integrated environmental, economic, and social outcomes.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Intensive collaboration, mutual learning and sharing of knowledge among the conservation and forestry bodies, forest managers, research institutions and other interested stakeholders to exploit synergies and minimise trade-offs in forest management.
?	Contribution to the development of computer models to be used as operational tools for examining the effects of climatic change on forest functioning.
?	Practical recommendations and guidelines addressing multiple, possibly conflicting objectives of forest management, to promote forest conservation and resilience and mitigate the impacts of various forest disturbances, while supporting the socio-economic goals of forests through the support of an efficient utilisation of forest resources and services.
?	Contribution to the achievement of EU forest related policy targets (biodiversity, bioeconomy, climate mitigation and adaptation).
?	Diversification of forest management methods and their mutual balance and appropriate use in the given context (?context-dependent integrative forest management?) through the combination of different scientific disciplines, strong involvement of practitioners, researchers and advisors, biodiversity monitoring systems based on expert taxonomic knowledge combined with technologies, decision support tools and sustainability indicators. Application of context-dependent and site-appropriate, multi-stakeholder participatory and interdisciplinary methods.
?	Enhanced knowledge on ecological forestry practices and their impacts on climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation/restoration.
Scope: This topic addresses integrative forest management strategies that optimise actively managed forest ecosystems in such a way that the ecological and socio-economic functions are sustainable and economic viable.
The aim is to achieve a better understanding how integrative forest management concepts (e.g. close-to-nature forestry, continuous cover forestry, retention forestry, etc.) are currently applied in Europe, their implications on the environment and biodiversity, society, and forest-based economy as well as to accelerate the implementation of innovative approaches through targeted and evidence-based guidelines and tools.
Proposals should:
?	Provide an in-depth analysis of current concepts and principles of integrative forest conservation, management and utilisation strategies and assess their socio-economic and ecological impacts;
?	Establish a network of living labs for integrative forest conservation, management and utilisation approaches inspired by best practices and covering different socio-cultural and bio-geographical conditions;
?	Develop applicable evidence-based guidelines and tools for the upscaling of integrative forest conservation, management and utilisation approaches;
?	Consider a strong stakeholder involvement and supportive policies;
?	Support exchange of knowledge, dialogue and good practices among stakeholders and institutions, including science-based dialogues.
The project must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China. This topic is within the scope of the Administrative Arrangement between the European Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People?s Republic of China on a Co-funding Mechanism for the period 2021-2024 to support collaborative research projects under the Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) and the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiatives.
 Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs. Interaction with other actions developed under the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Research Flagship and the Flagship on Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) is encouraged if relevant.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-16, Valorisation of ecosystem services provided by legume crops,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU zero pollution ambition, the successful proposal will promote sustainable, productive, climate-neutral, environment-friendly and resilient farming systems, which would provide consumers with affordable, safe, traceable, healthy and sustainable food while increasing the provision of ecosystem services.
The farm to fork strategy states that ?[a] key area of research will relate to (?) increasing the availability and source of alternative proteins such as plant, microbial, marine and insect-based proteins and meat substitutes?. The ambitious targets in the farm to fork strategy on the reduction of fertilizer use by at least 20% by 2030 and on reaching at least 25% of EU agricultural land under organic farming by 2030 will also create a favourable environment for the development of EU-grown protein plants which naturally enrich the soil reducing the need for synthetic fertilisers. Most recently, the Versailles declaration  also highlighted the importance of increasing EU plant-based proteins as a means of reducing the EU?s dependency on key imported agricultural products and inputs and improving food security.
The new common agricultural policy (CAP) put into practice eco-schemes that can provide support for longer rotation cycles with environmentally beneficial crops such as leguminous crops. Other instruments that benefit protein crops under the new CAP are sectoral interventions, investment subsidies under rural development programmes and coupled income supports.
Activities will also support the implementation of the action plan for the development of organic production.
Proposals results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved quantification, in environmental and economic terms, of the ecosystem services provided by legume crops, including those related to soil biodiversity and fertility.
?	Increased knowledge and capacity of farmers and agricultural advisers to include minor and major legume crops in their cropping schemes with a positive ecological and economic impact.
?	Diversified farming practices throughout the EU and Associated Countries, where legume crops contribute to healthier and sustainable diets, resilience to climate change and increase of agrobiodiversity.
Scope: The European Union and Associated Countries? arable agricultural systems are often characterised by short rotations or monocultures, leading to problems such as higher pest pressure, soil erosion, loss of soil fertility or loss of biodiversity. As a result, there is an imperative need to reveal the full potential of diversification of cropping systems, with the aim of improving productivity, and supporting the development of resource-efficient and sustainable value chains. Protein-rich plants, and in particular legumes, play a key role in cross-cutting issues related to crop rotation, sustainable soil management and closing nutrient cycles. They have the potential to enable the environmental sustainability, productivity, climate neutrality and resilience of farming systems, by increasing the provision of ecosystem services while restoring and enhancing biodiversity and generating fair economic returns for farmers.
The environmental, nutritional and economic benefits that leguminous crops bring to all players of the value chain, provide an opportunity for further developing the leguminous crop sector in the EU and Associated Countries. This could eventually contribute to reducing the EU?s dependency on imports of nitrogen fertilisers and protein crops for feed, while support meeting the objectives of farm to fork strategy.
While the direct benefits of legume crops as food and feed are usually recognized, their environmental and economic benefits derived from the increase of the provision of the ecosystem services they provide, are less understood and not valorised. The focus of this proposal is on the economic and environmental benefits of the production of legume crops, regardless their cultivation purpose is for food or for feed uses.
Proposals should:
?	Increase knowledge on the different and complementary benefits from the use of legume crops (both annual and perennials) in the provision of ecosystem and environmental services, such as the value of the nitrogen transfer to succeeding or companion crops (including in grassland systems), the efficiency of different legume varieties to fix nitrogen in the soil in function of specific conditions (e.g., soil type, established rhizobia consortia), the role of legume crops for wind protection, water runoff or other erosion control strategies.
?	Explore new synergies between combinations of legume crops and other crops that can benefit from nitrogen fixation, in systems like crop rotations, intercropping, mixed cropping, cover cropping or agroforestry.
?	Evaluate the global competitiveness of legume crops cultivation in different contexts of the EU and Associated Countries (considering relevant economic, social or environmental aspects) through a cost-benefit analyses and life-cycle environmental assessment, versus imports from third countries.
?	Develop tools or methods that allow to measure and quantify in economic terms the value of the nitrogen transfer between various crops, for different crop combinations, in relation to environmental aspects such as the reduction of use of nitrogen fertiliser, carbon emissions, pollution, nitrogen losses, reduced GHG emissions, pest/weed/disease management and increased crop and microbial diversity.
?	Identify and remove the barriers to crop diversification or to crop rotation. Provide indicators so that farmers and advisors are better equipped to evaluate the benefits of growing legumes, including for weed management, as well as recommendations to strengthen crop diversification and longer rotation cycles with environmentally beneficial crops.
?	Promote the engagement of downstream actors in new value chains based on crop diversification. This should facilitate the market penetration of leguminous crops, linked to market outlets and consumers demand and influence the transition towards more sustainable and healthy food and feed systems.
?	Include minor or underutilised legume crops (mostly perennial but also annual varieties) that are not the frequent objects of research activities. Consider their potential for enhancing the ecosystem and economic services not only due to their key role in sustainable soil management and closing nutrient cycles (likewise major legume crops) but also due to their adaptation to agroecological niches/marginal area and capability to withstand abiotic and abiotic stress and climate change.
?	Generate capacity building material, organize trainings or knowledge sharing activities, including the development of guidelines (e.g. booklets, decision-support tools) to foment the dissemination, uptake and upscale of results.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this or other topics (i.e. but not limited to projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-02 and HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-02-02-two-stage), and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe such as the upcoming partnership on agroecology  and the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? . Proposals should also seek potential synergies with and capitalise on the results of past or ongoing projects both in the EU and beyond (e.g., Horizon 2020 projects LegValue  and TRUE , the thematic network 'Legumes Translated?  or SusCrop ERA-NET project ).
Proposals should benefit both the conventional and the organic farming sectors.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-17, Interlinkages between biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems and the emergence of zoonotic diseases,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 4.00-3,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, projects will develop knowledge on the links between the degradation of ecosystems with its associated biodiversity loss and the exposure to, emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases to humans. This will compliment other initiatives by addressing the biodiversity and health nexus with a focus on the effects of biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems on the emergence of zoonotic diseases in the context of climate change and globalization.
Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better understand the relation between the degradation of ecosystems with its associated biodiversity loss, including both macro-organisms (e.g. insects, animal and plants) and environmental and host-associated microbiomes (e.g. micro algae, fungi, bacterial and virus) and the emergence of zoonotic diseases, focusing on how human drivers for biodiversity loss, such as illegal wildlife trade, land use change in biodiversity hot-spot regions, food consumption, use of antimicrobial agents, etc. interact with the spread of zoonotic diseases.
?	Understand under which conditions and at what scale the protection of biodiversity and the restoration of ecosystems can contribute to mitigate the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases.
?	Better understand the socio-economic and behavioural factors that will lead to the development and implementation of improved policies on mitigating the risk of emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases. This should also include the ecology and behavioural traits of those animals which play a role in the spread of zoonotic diseases.
?	Based on this knowledge, propose practical strategies to minimize the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases through addressing biodiversity loss.
?	Better understand the biodiversity ? health nexus and identify biodiversity relevant parameters and propose the necessary monitoring schemes for further integration into the One Health approach with specific focus on emerging zoonotic diseases. This monitoring should contribute to the establishment or improvement of early detection and warning systems on risks of emerging zoonotic diseases.
?	In collaboration among the projects to be funded, create a knowledge platform for a) sharing information on relevant research activities and results concerning the prevention of zoonotic disease emergence in relation to biodiversity; and b) reinforcing the communication and coordination between academics, innovators, end-users, researchers, public health and environmental authorities and citizens in order to create the strong system needed for the prevention of the emergence of zoonotic diseases. This platform should be a joint deliverable between the projects to be funded and will be expected to coordinate the research activities which aim to understand and mitigate the risks of zoonotic disease emergence in relation to the degradation of ecosystems with its associated biodiversity loss, allowing closure of current gaps and break down of existing silos. Proposals should dedicate appropriate resources to develop this joint deliverable in cooperation with the other project/s funded under this topic.
Scope: Zoonotic diseases, which result from cross-species transmission of pathogens between animals and humans, appear to emerge more frequently and pose significant threats to the health and welfare of people across the planet. Without the necessary scientific information and evidence on the underlying causes and drivers of this more frequent emergence, the only way of responding to them is after their emergence and spread.
Over the last decades, research has indicated that biodiversity loss and the linked degradation of ecosystems could simultaneously increase human exposure to existing pathogens, as well as increase of the probability of the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Unsustainable exploitation of biodiversity, land-use change, illegal wildlife trade and consumption, together with the impacts of climate change and use of antimicrobial agents, increase the contact between humans and wildlife that consequently lead to the more frequent occurrence of emerging infectious diseases, of which around 75% are of zoonotic origin.
The high risks of these infectious diseases demonstrate the need for a real paradigm shift: preventing the emergence and spread of infectious zoonotic diseases by focusing on the root causes and underlying mechanisms potentially linked to biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems and improving their prediction and early detection.
This topic aims to identify and understand better the interlinkages between biodiversity loss with the linked ecosystem degradation and the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Further research is needed to better understand how the different drivers that lead to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, and how the protection of biodiversity and the restoration of ecosystems may influence the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases. Also better understanding is needed on how the conservation of animal and microbiome genetic resources may influence the emergence of zoonotic diseases.
The better understanding of these interlinkages will help to establish better prediction and early detection systems, will enhance the coordination between all relevant stakeholders, ensure fast information sharing and early response and hence reduce the spread of zoonotic diseases.
The topic should contribute to better understanding the biodiversity ? health nexus and help towards an enhanced integration of biodiversity parameters and monitoring with the One Health approach.
The development of methods and identification of indicators to monitor the relevant biodiversity parameters will be essential as well as the establishment of baselines of these parameters.
The mitigation strategies in relation to biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation to be proposed should take into consideration all the aforementioned information and findings. The better understanding of the socio-economic and behavioural factors, as well as the involvement of local communities and environmental, animal and human health stakeholders is crucial for the preparation of these strategies.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under the same field and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, such as:
?	H?R????-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-11: What else is out there? Exploring the connection between biodiversity, ecosystem services, pandemics and epidemic risk;
?	HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-18: One Health approach for Food Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA);
?	HORIZON-HLTH-2021-ENVHLTH-02-03: Health impacts of climate change, costs and benefits of action and inaction.
To achieve the expected outcomes, the following also need to be ensured:
?	Coherence and coordination with the European Partnership for pandemic preparedness, the European Partnership for One Health/AMR Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and the European Partnership for Animal Health and Welfare (PAHW).
?	Opportunities for cooperation with relevant European or international Agencies and initiatives, such as European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), European Economic Area (EEA), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Agency (HERA), One Health High-Level Expert Panel (OHHLEP), One Sustainable Health, EU4Health actions (in particular One Health Surveillance), Preventing Zoonotic Disease Emergence (PREZODE), Ecohealth Alliance, etc.
The proposals should take up relevant knowledge assessed by major science-policy bodies such as the Intergovernmental science-policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and by the Convention on Biological Diversity. They should also take into consideration and build up on the results of the request made to EKLIPSE on Biodiversity and Pandemics. Proposals should show how their results and outcomes could provide timely information to the work of these and further relevant global initiatives.
The proposals should foresee cooperation with the European partnership on biodiversity Biodiversa+ and the Science Service ?Bio-agora? and use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms relevant to the topic. They should also contribute knowledge to the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.
Coordination with Member States and Associated Counties should be sought out.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities disciplines (SSH).",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-18, Additional activities for the European Biodiversity Partnership:  Biodiversa+,3/28/2023,COFUND,12/22/2022,,,Around 60.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The second instalment of the partnership is expected in continuation to contribute to expected outcomes specified in topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01: European partnership rescuing biodiversity to safeguard life on Earth, for continuation of the activities and the continuation of already agreed outcomes.
Scope: The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership Biodiversa+ identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01: European partnership rescuing biodiversity to safeguard life on Earth, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
The consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01: European partnership rescuing biodiversity to safeguard life on Earth is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls in years 2021 and 2022 based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.
The scope of the application for this call on the European partnership for Biodiversity Biodiversa+ should focus on the flagship programmes 2023-27 according to the partnership?s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years, which includes calls for research projects, biodiversity- and ecosystems monitoring and science-based policy advisory activities, and all horizontal activities to allow the Partnership to operate and to achieve its five specific objectives.
It is expected that the partnership continues to organise joint calls on an annual base and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects. It should build on, and widen, the data availability in European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud.
The partnership should collaborate closely with the EC ?Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity? and with the Science Service project ?Bio-Agora?, and seek to collaborate with EU space programmes (Copernicus, Galileo) to foster the use of emerging or operational space technologies for policy development. Moreover, the partnership should describe specific activities foreseen in order to strengthen the synergies with other related Missions and Partnerships.
While the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.
Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-02-01 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and additional partners, if any, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement.
The partnership should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programme(s) to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-1, Invasive alien species,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, projects will contribute to the following impact of destination ?Biodiversity and ecosystem services?: ?Understand and address direct drivers of biodiversity decline? invasive alien species??.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The establishment of alien species accidently introduced in the EU environment is minimised and where possible they are eradicated,
?	Early warning systems to inform relevant stakeholders of the introduction of invasive alien species, building upon EASIN,
?	The introduction of invasive alien species is effectively prevented and established ones are systemically managed,
?	Public awareness, literacy and engagement, on invasive alien species monitoring and management are supported and improved,
?	Pressure on species on the Red List threatened by invasive alien species is reduced, contributing to the following key commitment of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 ? a 50% reduction in the number of Red List species threatened by invasive alien species?.
Scope: Invasive alien species are one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss. Besides inflicting major damage to nature and the economy, many invasive alien species also facilitate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases, posing a threat to humans and native wildlife. The rate of new introductions of invasive alien species has increased in recent years. Without effective control measures, risks to our nature and health will continue to rise. Climate change and land-use changes facilitate the spread and establishment of many alien species and create new opportunities for them to become invasive. This topic is therefore contributing to the adaptation to climate change.
Regulation (EU) 1143/2014 on invasive alien species (IAS) entered into force on 1 January 2015. It establishes a list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). The IAS Regulation provides for a set of measures to be taken across the EU in relation to invasive alien species included on the Union list. EASIN (European Alien Species Information Network) facilitates information on Alien Species and officially supports the EU Regulation 1143/2014.
Successful proposals should:
?	Develop models based on dynamic data, accessible to end users, to prioritise species, manage pathways and sites most vulnerable by the introduction of invasive alien species;
?	Develop methods for the identification, early detection and surveillance of invasive alien species, such as sensors for biophysical signals (sounds, ultrasounds, volatile organic compounds, thermal etc.), DNA-based including barcoding and application of environmental DNA, artificial intelligence, sentinel plants in ports, airports, railway stations, and logistics platforms. The use of robotics (both aerial and non-aerial), especially in marine environments, could be considered.
Proposals should address Area A: terrestrial ecosystems or Area B: aquatic (including marine) ecosystems. The Area should be clearly indicated on the application.
Proposals should build synergies with on-going projects supported under Horizon 2020 and other projects supported under Horizon Europe. The project ?Natural Intelligence for Robotic Monitoring of Habitat? could provide hints about the usage of mobile robotic sensors.
Cross-articulation with the other data spaces, and notably with the European Open Science Cloud shall be foreseen, exploiting synergies and complementarities of the different approaches.
Participatory approaches, such as citizen science, could be appropriate modes of research for this action.
In area B in particular, projects results funded under the following topics should be considered: HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-03: Understanding and valuing coastal and marine biodiversity and ecosystems services, Topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-04: Assess and predict integrated impacts of cumulative direct and indirect stressors on coastal and marine biodiversity, ecosystems and their services and HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-01: Observing and mapping biodiversity and ecosystems, with particular focus on coastal and marine ecosystems. In addition, in area B, projects should coordinate their activities with objective 1 of the Mission ?Restore our ocean and waters?.
Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources to coordinate with existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms, in particular the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity. Collaboration with the European partnership on biodiversity Biodiversa+ should be explored, as needed.
This topic should involve contributions from the social sciences and humanities disciplines.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project would ensure that the approach proposed is compatible with the IAS policy implementation and that data and information generated is shared through EASIN.
International cooperation is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-2, Digital for nature,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 8.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 projects? results will contribute to the following impacts of the destination ?biodiversity and ecosystem services?: ?Plan, manage and expand protected areas and improve the conservation status of species and habitats based on up-to-date knowledge and solutions?; ?to understand and address drivers of biodiversity decline and ?mainstream biodiversity, ecosystem services, including through the development of Nature-based Solutions?.
The projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	A better monitoring (in terms of the number of species and habitats, more exhaustive territory coverage, more frequent in time, more accurate and cost-effective) of biodiversity in the EU by high-throughput methods (for example environmental DNA, sound/image/spectral analysis, lidar, usage of mobile platforms, space technologies, etc.), leading to a better implementation of the nature directives.
?	A better understanding of the state of nature and of the drivers of biodiversity loss (linked to direct human activity, to climate change, etc?) and of the state of conservation of nature through a better usage of existing data, and through the bridging of data gaps in order to support the implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and therefore to reverse biodiversity loss and to restore and protect ecosystems.
?	A more complete view of the state of nature and its evolution which is needed to support policy implementation and policy making, including the Member States? reporting obligations, supporting the definition and implementation of prevention and restoration measures and the monitoring of the achievement of their objectives, the extension of protected areas, the monitoring of invasive alien species, and the implementation of Nature based solutions and the assessment of their performance.
Scope: As quoted in a recent paper in Nature Communications, the growing amount of the collected environmental data is not optimally used: ?there is a mismatch between the ever-growing volume of raw measures (videos, images, audio-recordings) acquired for ecological studies and our ability to process and analyse this multi-source data to derive conclusive ecological insights rapidly and at scale? . In the European Union, there is already a range of group of experts monitoring species and habitats, including in the view of reporting under the Birds and Habitats directives. However, the generated datasets are not sufficiently accessible (too many small, isolated communities of practice, different servers, different data access methods, different formats, rarely accessible through web-services) and too often not well known or advertised outside of their original circle of experts: the access to the results (consolidated data, statistics, maps) of these field surveys should be significantly concentrated behind single entry points. Also, the access to modern technologies (e.g., image recognition, sound analysis, high-throughput DNA-based techniques, usage of AI, usage of space, etc.) too often represents an important effort for each group of experts, beyond their environmental expertise. As a result, the technological developments remain an important effort for each group, while the solutions should better be provided as a service (to be configured to the need of each group) and mutualised. The natural domain being very large and sometimes difficult to access, the existing databases are still not dense enough, in terms of spatial and temporal coverage: many species and habitats are insufficiently covered (and sometimes not monitored at all), resulting in information gaps. Also, scarce samplings do not allow to distinguish non-presence from a lack of/insufficient/inadequate fields visit. A massive use of automated, and potentially mobile, sensor technologies (such as, but not limited to, images, video, sounds/ultra-sounds recording, spectral signatures, structure description by lidar, environmental DNA sampling, etc.) the use of remote sensing technologies (e.g. to over large areas, monitor environmental condition) and associated with processing algorithms (in particular, but not limited to, deep learning and AI processing algorithms) is therefore needed. The goal of this topic is to facilitate the access to data, encourage the usage of automated/robotic/space data collection systems for data collection, encourage community approaches for the exchange of data and good practices (in particular for data processing).
Proposals should address Area A or Area B as follows. The Area should be clearly indicated on the application.
?	Area A: a project focussing on data harvesting through high-throughput methods (as described in the introduction, e.g. environmental DNA, sound/image analysis, lidar, spectrometry, usage of mobile platforms, remote-sensing, etc.), analysis and interoperability solutions, with the goal of concentrating the information in a single access point, and lowering the technical hurdle for the biologist and managers of natural sites, offering the best solutions in a ready-to-use form;
?	Area B: a project focussing on new robotic solutions, including mobile, to improve the efficiency of biodiversity related solutions, allowing to improve the performance of the field campaign, with denser information of species and habitats.
Area A: data harvesting, analysis and interoperability solutions
The successful proposal is expected to address the needs in terms of IT solutions, to increase information density, in terms of species and habitats sampled, territory coverage, timeliness, and accuracy.
As a result, much denser data collections should be available through a common data portal. The successful proposal should demonstrate the feasibility to combine different sources of information, for example to assess the conservation status of habitats or species. In that respect, several approaches could be tested, from data combinations defined by expert rules, and data storage formats, to machine learning or data-mining technologies. Such digital solutions could support the definition of conservation measures and management plans, and the monitoring and forecast (though model ingesting in-situ observations) of their progress to their objectives, at site, regional and national levels. Furthermore, the results could be used by member states for their formal monitoring and reporting obligations, or to check and enhance the performance of Nature Based Solutions.
The successful proposal should:
?	Ensure interoperability of available data, enabling EU-scale information systems by developing solutions to connect and harvest data from already existing data bases. This will guarantee information fusion and support third party usage of the data.
?	Develop cost-effective and easy-to use tools and software to collect and analyse different existing data sources and formats (in vivo data, photographs, sound recordings, lidar, spectrometry, eDNA, satellite images etc.), to facilitate cost-effective data analysis, map and link existing databases and provide algorithms to better analyse them.
?	Develop data hosting and data processing solutions to extract information on populations (such as diversity, counts, trends), habitats (such as identification, area covered, and area change in time), assessment of conservation status and trend, information of species and habitats health conditions, degradations, and destructions (natural or human-driven). The accumulation of information should allow synoptic analysis of species and habitats, allowing to detect hot spot of issues and trends. Innovative solutions, such as data mining, remote-sensing and AI approaches need to be considered.
?	Develop a solution to host, process, analyse and search available data in relation to protected habitats and species (including protected sites management information, their conservation objectives and measures, and restoration actions).
?	Analyse and define infrastructure solutions, that would let biologists and managers of natural sites quickly create a dedicated working framework, furbished with all data harvesting, processing, sharing solutions. In this approach, the future European Green Deal data space should be considered as a potential common solution, or part of the solution.
?	Develop tutorials for practitioners, based on academics and industry knowledge, on how to best use existing databases and data harvesting, data analysis and data sharing solutions. The tutorials should help the users to quickly set up and use their working environment.
?	Propose easy-to-use solutions to utilise robotic sensors and Internet of Things (IoT): automated sensors, automated sampler, including mobile sensors (terrestrial, aerial and under-water) and animals tagging solutions, data sharing through wireless communication systems, to support a systematic data collection. Such approach should help better mapping the known/unknown and significantly increase the density of collected data, spatially and temporally.
?	Analyse the conditions under which data, raw data acquired from sampling, data coming from existing databases and data resulting from processing can be shared. A clear data sharing framework, accommodating special needs, simple to use in practice, supporting open data policies, and enabling the broadest usage whilst encouraging the largest community to contribute, should be defined. Special attention will be paid to endangered species and sensitive species (in the sense of the Birds and Habitats Directives) for which the shared data needs to be controlled, and methods for effective detection of invasive species by high throughput search would be encouraged.
?	Enable EU Member States, Associated Countries, and accession countries to coherently set conservation objectives, preparing management plans, manage shared habitat types and species, deal with similar conflicts and socio-economic dimensions, permitting procedures, spatial planning, with a focus on implementing the Birds and Habitats Directives and their Natura 2000 network.
?	Fully exploit and build complementarities with the ongoing work regarding the establishment of the European Open Science Cloud and interact with relevant projects developing metadata standards and added value tools to ensure interoperability within and across fields of study.
?	Contribute to a web of FAIR data and supporting services that enable an interconnected disciplinary ecosystem that allows stakeholders to share digital objects and build on them in a seamless fashion.
?	The architecture for a unified EU web-GIS with all the data collected from the Directives should be considered. In that matter, the proposed system should allow the member states sharing their habitats and species maps, and in particular the habitats maps used to designate their Natura 2000 sites, as well as subsequent updates. Also, the platform should help collecting information to update habitats and species maps, in order to obtain a common knowledge database about habitats and species, and their evolution, in relation to the Birds and Habitats Directives. The platform should as well foster the implementation of open data best practices at European level and across boundaries.
?	Automatic translation functions should be offered by the platform to better connect EU Member States, Associated Countries and Accession Countries to support them in the implementation of the legislation on nature protection (such as the Birds and Habitats directives, the Invasive Alien Species regulation or the Marine Strategic Framework Directive).
Proposals should consider the possibilities offered by the future ?Green data spaces? (CNECT). The DEP CSAs on the ?preparatory actions for the European Green Deal Data Space? (exploring cloud-to-edge solutions, platforms and initiatives for data storage, exchange, and analysis as good practices for setting up the data spaces) are expected for Q4 2022-Q2 2024 and the ?data spaces support centre? will start delivering on architectural blueprints in late 2023 and onward.
Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for cooperation and networking activities. Proposals should link to other relevant Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects and initiatives, such as BiCIKL, EuropaBON, BioDT and connect to existing European Biodiversity data infrastructures including DiSSCo, eLTER and LifeWatch, where relevant. Proposals should also connect with relevant projects under Horizon Europe topics, such as HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-01: European participation in global biodiversity genomics endeavours aimed at identifying all biodiversity on Earth.?, HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-02: Data and technologies for the inventory, fast identification and monitoring of endangered wildlife and other species groups, HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-07: Ecosystems and their services for an evidence-based policy and decision-making and HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02: Protect and restore marine and fresh water ecosystems and biodiversity. Projects using satellite data should link to HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-14: User-oriented solutions building on environmental observation to monitor critical ecosystems and biodiversity loss and vulnerability in the European Union.
The possible participation of the JRC would help ensure that the methodologies proposed can support environmental compliance assurance, particularly by leveraging geospatial intelligence.
Collaboration with the European partnership on biodiversity ?Biodiversa +? should be explored, as needed.
Area B: new robotic sensors for biodiversity
To increase the density of species and habitats observations across the EU territory, new robotic, and possible mobile, solutions need to be developed.
The proposed innovative solutions should:
?	Be ready to use, easy to deploy and operate in natural environment.
?	Consider automated solutions, and mobile platforms (land, air, water and under water) carrying sensors (such as, but not limited to, image, sound, lidar, spectrometry, eDNA, etc.) should be designed with fields campaigns in mind, in particular in terms of autonomy (energy, autonomy of moving and sampling decisions). Improvements in terms of species tagging, and species-carried tracking or telemetry devices should also be considered.
?	The project should focus on innovative sensors that would allow significantly increasing knowledge in biodiversity, or bringing new information about the species and habitats conservation status, and increase spatial and temporal coverage, and to facilitate access to environments that are difficult to sample.
?	Propose a large degree of data collecting automation and compatibility with the system described in project 1.
?	The project should generate at least 1 innovative prototype of robotic/automated sensor and 1 innovative prototype of mobile solution, demonstrating improved performances compared to the currently available solutions.
?	The project should analyse the conditions and costs of the production of the robotic system, as well as the conditions and costs of its usage and maintenance.
The project ?Natural Intelligence for Robotic Monitoring of Habitat? could provide hints about the usage of mobile robotic sensors.
International cooperation is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-3, Dependence of society and the economy on pollinators,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 6.50-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and in particular with the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU pollinators? initiative, projects will contribute to mainstream biodiversity in society and the economy.
Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
?	Direct and indirect dependences of our society and the economy on pollinators are better understood and quantified;
?	Monetary and non-monetary valuation of ecosystem services provided by pollinators are advanced, and used to improve ecosystem accounting;
?	Tools for mainstreaming pollinator conservation into the food, health, energy, materials and land management sectors are developed, tested and promoted with public authorities, businesses and the general public;
?	Risks of reversible and irreversible cascading effects in natural and modified ecosystems due to pollinator decline, and their impacts on human wellbeing, are better understood and forecasted, and integrated into models for participatory scenario planning.
Scope: The importance of pollinators for humankind is common knowledge, featuring prominently outside of the scientific realm in popular culture and arts. Yet, even well-known benefits provided by pollinators such as crop pollination are still inadequately understood. Other benefits remain for the most part obscure, and thus unacknowledged, due to the lack of research targeting the complexity of pollinator niches and plant-pollinator networks. Amid the dramatic decline of pollinating species in Europe, these gaps hinder understanding of the character and full magnitude of threats to human wellbeing. Moreover, the gaps hinder mainstreaming of the conservation of pollinators, and more broadly biodiversity, in the public and private sector and thereby impede an effective societal response. This topic aims to address fundamental knowledge gaps in functional roles of pollinators in natural (natural plant-pollinators networks) and human-modified ecosystems (e.g. agro-ecosystem), and building on that i) advance research on far reaching consequences of their decline and scenario planning and ii) develop and disseminate tools that enable systematic mainstreaming in key sectors.
The proposed projects should build on the Assessment Report on Pollinators, Pollination and Food Production of IPBES , the first ever EU-wide Ecosystem Assessment 2020 , the INCA project , the European Red List assessments , and knowledge and experience gained through past projects supported under the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation . Furthermore, the projects should liaise with relevant ongoing projects under Horizon Europe  and EU funded monitoring initiatives .
The proposals should show how their results would contribute to the EU policies, as well as to the global sustainable development agenda (UN Sustainable development Goals.
Proposals should include specific tasks and envisage sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g., activities, workshops, as well as joint communication and dissemination) with all projects funded under this topic and to facilitate cooperation with the European biodiversity partnership Biodiversa+  and other platforms such as the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity .
For the implementation of the eligibility condition on the 'multi-actor approach', proposals should ensure adequate involvement of researchers, farmers and other land managers, businesses involved in the food, medicine, energy and/or materials sectors, decision-makers at local and/or regional level, civil society organisations and other relevant actors.
Successful proposals should:
?	Investigate essential functional roles of pollinators in natural and human-modified ecosystems, and associated ecosystem services. This should encompass ecosystem services underpinned by pollinators both directly and indirectly;
?	Fill knowledge gaps on animal pollination ecology (what pollinates what, how much, where and when) and investigate the full spectrum of animals that pollinate wild and cultivated plants in Europe, going beyond the well-known insects (bees, hoverflies, butterflies, moths). The structure and functionality of plant-pollinator networks should be analysed. The research scope should include the European continent as well as EU overseas territories;
?	Build a platform that will serve one-stop shop for information on animal pollination ecology. A database with systematised information on plan-pollinator interactions, including the spatial dimension of plant-pollinator networks, should be part of the platform. The platform should build on what already exists and should be devised in close collaboration with researchers and other potential users. Options to integrate this deliverable into the already existing platforms should be explored, with a view to ensure its long-term viability;
?	Assess the dependency of society and the economy on ecosystem services underpinned directly and indirectly by pollinators, quantify and map the risks associated with pollinator decline. Monetary and non-monetary valuation of those ecosystem services should be advanced, including their tangible and less tangible elements, and utilised to improve ecosystem accounts and scale up their use in the public and private sector;
?	Investigate biomass supply chains dependent on pollinators, build tools for businesses to assess their vulnerability to pollinator decline and improve guidelines on how they can help to reverse the decline and thereby mitigate future risks. This should in particular cover the food (including production of plants with mandatory cross-pollination), medicine, energy and materials sectors;
?	Build tools for land managers and planners to support spatial decision-making with regard to the conservation of pollinators and protection of the local flow of ecosystem services that they deliver, e.g., digital atlases, maps, applications. In particular, tools for farmers should be developed, enabling assessment of impacts on their income and overall business performance of farms, early warning of pollination-deficit as well as social impacts on farming communities;
?	Investigate the dependency of sustainable nutrition on pollinators and potential risks due to their decline. Particular attention should be paid to food with invaluable and irreplaceable properties for human health (e.g. with regard to micronutrients);
?	Investigate risks of cascading effects in natural (natural plant-pollinators networks) and human-modified ecosystems due to pollinator decline and their impacts on human wellbeing, and undertake scenario forecasting towards 2050 in the case of an unmitigated pollinator decline. Uncertainty and irreversibility of the effects should be well integrated in the build-up of models",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-4," Biodiversity, economics and finance:  Understanding macro-financial risks associated with biodiversity loss",2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities and in particular with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU strategy for financing the transition to a sustainable economy, the successful proposal(s) will help unlock financial flows needed for reversing biodiversity loss, and contribute to mainstreaming biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital in the society and economy.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	New knowledge to accelerate the ecological transition and socioeconomic transformation towards nature-positive economy across EU, in a context of erosion of natural capital and degradation of ecosystems and their essential services;
?	Enhanced understanding and quantification of the macroeconomic significance of biodiversity and implications of its loss at EU level as a basis for more coordinated and better organised responses by key economic actors and institutions, including key policy making processes (e.g., EU semester);
?	Information, tools and metrics to better integrate biodiversity and its loss into mainstream macro-financial analytical frameworks, risk assessment and management methods as a basis for enhancing natural capital and NBS;
?	Development of more comprehensive and more robust environmental risk management in the financial sector;
?	Mobilisation of mainstream finance to slow down, and reverse biodiversity loss in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development by catalysing nature-positive investments contributing to the objectives of the European Green Deal;
?	Evidence base to support the implementation of the EU strategy for financing the transition to a sustainable economy.
Scope: The erosion of natural capital combined with the collapse of ecosystems entails potentially far-reaching economic and financial implications, including risks for macroeconomic and financial stability of key institutions, countries and regions. The decline of ecosystem services poses physical risks for economic and financial actors that depend upon those services, while socioeconomic transformations could trigger transition risks. As more than half of the world's GDP relies on nature , it is estimated that the risks triggered by ecosystem degradation to human societies could be at least as high as those imposed by climate change. Furthermore, these risks are growing as biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates in human history, which calls for improved understanding, assessment and risk management approaches by key economic actors such as corporates, governments, central banks and financial supervisors. However, a wide range of challenges, including the complexity of ecosystem processes, uncertainty about tipping points and valuation problems, make it very difficult.
Actions should improve the state-of-art knowledge on the relationships between biodiversity, economy and the financial system including better understanding of the nature and degree of risks associated to biodiversity loss, how these risks interact with each other and are likely to evolve over time.
In particular, actions are expected to:
?	Expand the evidence base on the dependence of the EU economy and its financial sector on nature, including by producing relevant macroeconomic indicators, e.g., assessing the share of the EU GDP and employment that depends on nature and evaluate implications of biodiversity loss. As much as possible, research should also extend to country level analysis and/or prepare the ground for future more in-depth studies with increased geographical resolution.
?	Develop scenarios tailored to financial risk assessment, including identification of assets under highest risk from being stranded and sectors that represent the highest risk exposure.
?	Co-design principles for a more comprehensive and more robust environmental risk management in the financial sector, develop innovative methodologies and tools to support risk assessment that can better capture the specificities of nature and ecosystems.
?	Explore tools to assess the alignment of corporates and financial institutions with major European and global biodiversity-related goals, including by leveraging of the EU Taxonomy on Sustainable Finance.
?	Investigate how biodiversity loss interacts with climate change and other socio-environmental challenges in regard of macro-financial stability and how different risks can reinforce each other.
?	Identify possible response options and issue recommendations for EU institutions and Member States, investors, companies and other financial market participants about macro-financial risks of biodiversity loss.
In their research, actions should investigate various possible risk categories including both physical and transition ones, their transmission channels and cascading effects through sectors and supply chains, as well as adaptive capacity of economic and financial agents/institutions, with particular focus on the EU, its Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries. The analysis should extend to worst-case scenarios and include low-probability but high-impact biodiversity-related tail risks.
Actions should build on and/or establish synergies with the relevant work by initiatives/projects/studies including, but not limited to, the World Economic Forum?s New Nature Economy Report Series , Network for Greening the Financial System , Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures , The Finance for Biodiversity (F4B) initiative Accounting for ecosystems and their services in the European Union (INCA)  and EU Member States (MAIA)  projects, Indebted to Nature report  and the working paper ?A ?Silent Spring? for the Financial System? Exploring Biodiversity-Related Financial Risks in France? .
Actions are expected to involve and co-create with the end-users (financial institutions, non-financial corporations, governments etc.) to fully account for their respective views and needs. Actions should bring together from the start multiple types of scientific expertise in social sciences and humanities, in particular in economics and finance, as well as scientific expertise in biodiversity and natural capital.
Actions should envisage clustering activities with projects funded under this topic as well as with other relevant Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 projects working on links between biodiversity and sustainable finance and economics of biodiversity . To this end proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, joint activities, and joint deliverables",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-5," Transformative action of policy mixes, governance and digitalisation addressing biodiversity loss",2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 2.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, in particular with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the 2030 climate pact, successful proposals will develop knowledge and tools to understand the role of transformative change for biodiversity policy making, address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, and initiate, accelerate and upscale biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in our society. They will also help understanding the impacts of and the opportunities offered by digital transformation, new emerging technologies, and social innovation on biodiversity. Successful proposals will contribute to the following expected impact: mainstream biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital in the society and economy: integrate them into public and business decision-making; build approaches for enabling transformative changes to face societal challenges including through the deployment of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS).
Projects should address all of the following outcomes:
?	Foresight on society well-being based on realistic assumptions on careful use of natural capital and analysis of the consequences in terms of economic growth.
?	Evaluation of feasibility and limits of decoupling economic activities from natural capital use.
?	Knowledge and understanding of the transformative changes needed to address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss underpinned by societal values and behaviours, better design of policy mixes and governance.
?	Operational knowledge available to, and used by policymakers, on indirect drivers of biodiversity loss that are underpinned by societal values and behaviours, and on the transformative changes that are necessary to tackle these indirect drivers.
?	Improved and new systemic, sustainable policy mixes and governance approaches developed to enable biodiversity-relevant transformative change, based on a range of policy tools, economic research, instruments or regulations.
?	Methods and tools promoting win-win solutions for biodiversity and socio-economic objectives, the use and mainstreaming of ?green over grey? approaches and the application of the ?do no harm? principle are available and taken up across the policy spectrum, planning and investment decisions, business and finance, and civil society.
?	Approaches to facilitate the application of such methods and tools are identified and used, while factoring in societal and political processes (such as citizen engagement, political campaigns, science denialism). Solutions can include stocktaking of good practice, standards, agreements, charters, commitments, regulations, engaging society and incorporating lifelong learning.
?	A better understanding of the impacts on, risks and opportunities for biodiversity of digital transformation (for example data-driven technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, miniaturised sensors, citizen science applications, crowd sourcing), new materials (e.g., for biomimicry), the energy sector (e.g., through energy/electricity infrastructure), and new and emerging technologies.
?	Identification and assessment of how system-level change affecting biodiversity through social innovation happens.
?	Testing active intervention by R&I policy and sector policies (niche creation, reformulation of governance), also by empowering and endowing communities.
Scope: In line with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, successful proposals will develop:
?	operational knowledge and understanding of transformative change needed to address the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss underpinned by societal values and behaviours, which is available to, and used by policy makers.
?	improved and innovative governance tools and policy mixes that can effectively initiate, accelerate and upscale such biodiversity-relevant transformative changes in our society.
?	help understanding the impacts of and the opportunities offered by digital transformation, use of data and sensors, emerging technologies such as AI and robotics and social innovation on biodiversity.
?	Proposals should look at key indirect drivers of biodiversity loss (including production and consumption patterns, human population dynamics and trends, trade, technological innovations and local through global governance), the kind of transformative changes necessary to tackle these societal drivers, effective governance approaches, tools and policy mixes to enable these changes, and how to further mainstream biodiversity into policy making, science, and governance within and beyond socio-economic, climate and environmental agendas.
?	Proposals should generate knowledge on how to tackle biodiversity loss linked to technological and social innovation, which includes digitalisation. Proposals should explain how changes by technological/social innovation are impacting biodiversity ? for example by bringing in new and emerging technologies, new production processes, consumer products, regulations, incentives, or participatory processes.
?	Proposals should produce case studies on what transformative change means in practice and a collection of good and failed examples of developing and implementing policy tools, best practices and instruments, and on impacts of digitalisation, which could feed into the just transition process and inform and inspire transformative change through learning, co-creation and dialogue.
?	Proposals should develop methodologies to assess the impacts of their proposed solutions on policy and its decision making. This includes impacts from energy/electricity infrastructure related to digitalisation, on democracy and on trust in science on environmental, social and economic systems. Such assessments should focus on the direct and indirect effects of digital developments on biodiversity, intertwined with climate change and health.
?	This topic should involve contributions from the social sciences and humanities disciplines, as well as social innovation.
?	The proposals should build their analysis upon the synergies of multiple Sustainable Development Goals, to deliver direct and indirect biodiversity benefits, and of the role of biodiversity in reaching the set of Sustainable Development Goals, considering the importance of policy mixes, governance and digitalisation.
?	Proposals should include specific tasks and allocate sufficient resources to develop joint deliverables (e.g., activities, workshops, joint communication and dissemination) with all projects from the same topic and the portfolio of all projects on transformative change related to biodiversity funded under this destination since 2021.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-6, Promoting pollinator friendly farming systems,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy, the EU climate policy under the European Green Deal, successful proposals will promote a pollinator friendly agriculture, contribute to the transition to more sustainable practices in agriculture, and support biodiversity in agroecosystems.
The project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Farming systems are more pollinator-friendly and support (agro)biodiversity;
?	Pollinator-friendly varieties, rotations and combination of crops are promoted;
?	Farmers are more aware of the importance of pollinator-specific planning and measures available to enhance pollination services;
?	Breeding sector is adapted to develop varieties adapted to pollinator-friendly farming.
Scope: The production of many crops depends on pollinators. Different types of measures are needed to tackle the causes of pollinator decline, enhance crop pollination, and promote pollinators in agriculture. Many crops have specific traits, which have been identified to enhance crop?pollinator interactions. The development of crop varieties with specific traits to attract and reward pollinators is an appealing strategy to address needs of agriculture and pollinators. This could also improve crop yields, nutritional resources for pollinators and promote a pollinator-friendly agriculture.
Pollination activities are also impacted by variety (genotype), environment, and management practices (GxExM). Pollinator-specific planning needs to consider temporal and spatial crop management and other strategies of management (e.g., field margin composition and structure) to enhance pollination services.
Proposals should:
?	Increase the understanding of the crop-farming system-pollinator relationship in combination with the interaction between crop, environment and management (GxExM);
?	Identify crop traits that enhance crop-pollinator interactions, engage in breeding activities and contribute to the development of pollinator-friendly varieties;
?	Identify, test and demonstrate farming systems that take into consideration temporal and spatial diversification of crops as well as landscape features to match pollinators needs;
?	Promote and facilitate the uptake of farm-pollinator friendly practices;
?	Support capacity building, training and education enabling farmers/growers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices;
?	Develop strategies to create value of pollinator friendly approaches along the value chain.
Proposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and ensure collaboration with projects funded under the following call in Horizon Europe work programme 2021-2022: HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-02-01-two-stage: Maintaining and restoring pollinators and pollination services in European agricultural landscapes.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of researchers, the breeding sector, farmers, agricultural advisors and other relevant actors. The topic is open to all types of farming systems (e.g., arable farming, horticulture, fruit trees) in various geographical and pedo-climatic conditions. Result of activities should benefit both conventional and organic farming",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-7, Reintroduction of landscape features in intensive agricultural areas,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy and the common agricultural policy, successful proposals will contribute to develop and improve practices in agriculture to support and make sustainable use of biodiversity and a wide range of ecosystems services.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Drivers and challenges for the re-introduction of landscape features in intensive farming areas are better identified.
?	Strategies to reintroduce landscape features in intensive agricultural areas for national and regional policy- and decision-makers are built, contributing to the following key-commitments of the EU biodiversity strategy 2030: ?At least 10% of agricultural area is under high-diversity landscape features?; and ?Three billion new trees are planted in the EU, in full respect of ecological principles?.
?	Solutions for climate change adaptation and to provide ecosystem services, in particular carbon sequestration, are developed for areas of intensive agriculture.
?	The ground for possible future demonstration projects is prepared.
Scope: According to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, ?to provide space for wild animals, plants, pollinators and natural pest regulators,10% of agricultural area should be brought back under high-diversity landscape features, including, inter alia, buffer strips, rotational or non-rotational fallow land, hedges, non-productive trees, terrace walls, and ponds?. These should help enhance carbon sequestration, prevent soil erosion and depletion, filter air and water, and support climate adaptation. In addition, more biodiversity often leads to more agricultural production over the medium and long term.
In the EU there are large agricultural intensive areas where nature has almost disappeared. There is a need to reintroduce nature to improve the state of the environment by delivering ecosystem services and as a contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation. In particular it is needed to achieve ecological corridors, in conjunction with other multifunctional Nature-based Solutions. Landscape features may also be included as remedial measures to protect soil; their biogeochemical functions may counteract the spread of chemical pollutants from agriculture to groundwater and open waters, especially those derived from natural and mineral fertilizers.
The new common agricultural policy (CAP) may offer specific tools to support farmers who dedicate space for biodiversity rich landscape features, such as dedicated eco-schemes or area related interventions (such as agri-environmental interventions) or non-productive investment interventions (one-off costs arising from establishing landscape features such as hedges, ponds, wetlands or stone walls). The agri-environment interventions under CAP Strategic Plans will continue to be implemented on a voluntary basis. They have been used in a quite limited extent until now to promote the reintroduction of biodiversity-rich landscape features in areas of intensive agriculture. Eco-schemes are new tools to support farmers in the first pillar of the CAP (direct payments) in the form of incentives to farmers to adopt more environment-friendly practices. They may cover the reintroduction of biodiversity rich landscape features, but this will depend on a number of factors, notably the implementation choices of Member States in their CAP Strategic Plans and the level of support.
This topic intends to look into key-factors which may lead to the reintroduction of landscape features in areas of intensive agriculture beyond financial incentives.
Proposals should:
?	assess the increase of the environmental and economic value and the potential for land productivity linked to the increase of biodiversity rich landscape elements on agricultural land with intensive organization of production. They should address the valuation (monetary and social benefits) of the ecosystem services of landscape features, based on existing R&I projects, and assess the perception of land managers/owners of this value increase. Proposals could notably build on available knowledge on Natural Capital Accounting .
?	investigate into possible business models which can combine the reintroduction of landscape features with rewarding economic activities including possibly recreational ones. This could build on positive experiences with productive trees part of arable land agroforestry systems. Projects should address the need to build green corridors and consider where and why reintroducing landscape features makes sense for this. The need to restore water systems through the restoration of streams and small rivers should be included.
?	assess the decision-making process of land owners/managers which can lead to the reintroduction of landscape features in areas of intensive agriculture and analyse enabling mechanisms. This assessment should go beyond analysing available financial incentives and should include in particular factors such as social, generational and gender aspects, awareness about the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the importance of agricultural land for maintaining biodiversity in the natural landscape matrix in the context of climate change and persistent landscape fragmentation, the type of land exploitation (land in private ownership or lent, legal form of holdings?), etc,
?	identify possible pathways towards more diversified business models involving nature and what could be the right incentive(s) (beyond financial incentives) to lead to change.
?	formulate strategies to reintroduce landscape features in areas of intensive agriculture.
The topic is open to all types of farming systems (e.g., arable farming, horticulture, fruit trees) in various geographical and pedo-climatic and conditions.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.
Proposals should build on the results of relevant EU-funded research projects. They should use existing platforms and information sharing mechanisms notably the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity.
The JRC may provide expertise on landscape features identification, typology, quantification in the frame of EU policy.",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-8, Conservation and protection of carbon-rich and biodiversity-rich forest ecosystems,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the EU biodiversity and climate objectives, successful proposals will support the protection of biodiversity-rich forest ecosystems, at the species? distribution rear edges and margins that are at high risk of collapse in light of a rapidly changing climate.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Improved knowledge on the cross-impacts between biodiversity and climate change: drivers of biodiversity loss and the interrelation with forest-based adaptation and mitigation needs; impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity and forest species migration; and links between forest species diversity and forest resilience to climate change.
?	Identification of win-win management practices (including non-intervention, climate-smart forestry) and development and implementation of ecosystem protection and restoration methods and tools for resilient, carbon rich and biodiversity supportive forests.
?	Better understanding of the drivers and barriers for natural co-migration of forest communities and development of approaches and guidelines to foster co-migration.
?	Improved tools and indices for the joint monitoring of biodiversity and climate aspects on forests.
?	Empirical analysis of the current forest management and conservation practices in European forests of high ecological value, including governance (regulations and their impact), management responses to climate change and an assessment of drivers that determine management on the ground.
?	Strict protection of primary and old-growth forest in Europe by 2030.
Scope: Biodiversity-rich forest ecosystems, in particular at the species? distribution edges, are at a high risk in light of a rapidly changing climate. When not being in their optimal climate conditions, they are more fragile to biotic and abiotic damages and do not provide ecosystem services in an optimal manner.
While for tree species assisted migration and assisted gene flow is considered as a possibly solution in actively managed forests, the dependent forest communities (e.g., plants, fungi, insects, soil microorganisms etc.) might fail to follow the speed of habitat shifts what in turn may result in a loss of biodiversity. In addition, migration failure of mutualistic species (fungi, mycorrhiza) can jeopardize the success of tree migration.
Protected areas without the option for assisted migration, will particularly depend on the larger landscape context for community migration and adaptation, as many of them have not been designed to account for the long-term and large-scale dynamics.
Proposals will:
?	Set up case studies in European forests or tropical forests; particularly targeting forests of high ecological value, such as primary and old-growth forests, Mediterranean forests, peat swamp forests or mangroves.
?	Improve existing or develop new predictive models of biodiversity changes, advance the understanding of species connection with the forest habitat, and analyse to what extent species can survive in a changed and fragmented habitat with a view to establishing protected forest networks.
?	Analyse directions of assisted tree migration to maximize dynamic gene conservation (as form of ex situ conservation)
?	Assess the risk for biodiversity loss in protected areas and develop protection strategies that consider the larger landscape and regional context to allow for natural species and community migration.
?	Develop approaches and guidelines for forest managers and conservationists in a context of forest ecosystem migration and map scenarios of potential forest ecosystem migration routes.
?	Connect with relevant institutions at regional, national and EU-level as well as relevant stakeholders to regularly disseminate the research results.
?	Improve monitoring techniques, including remote-sensing and field-data methods integrating technologies such as AI, IoT, robotics or blockchain, to better assess biodiversity and climate aspects of forests.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.
The project must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain.
JRC will contribute with dataset on forest tree species distribution and support the development of satellite monitoring of forest metrics",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-01-9, Selective breeding programme for organic aquaculture,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities and in particular with the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the 2030 climate target pact, a selective breeding programme for organic aquaculture will be developed contributing to the impact ?develop and improve practices in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture to support and make sustainable use of biodiversity and a wide range of ecosystems services?.
The selected project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Contribution to a non-toxic environment, to a high level of biodiversity (including genetic diversity) and to high animal welfare standards meeting the species-specific behavioural needs;
?	Significantly boost in the quality of aquaculture products, improving traits of economic and welfare importance;
?	Increased feed efficiency that will also result in a reduced environmental impact through the minimization of feed residues in the natural environment;
?	Less disease outbreaks through genetic progression, i.e. greater disease resistance, increased feed efficiency, faster growth and improved traits of economic and welfare importance;
?	Increased knowledge and acceptance of organic aquaculture and its products in the general public through true stakeholder and consumer involvement.
Scope: Regulation (EU) 2018/848 lays down detailed production rules for organic aquaculture and requires the use of organic juveniles for on-growing purposes. Breeding under organic conditions is essential to achieve the objectives of organic aquaculture and respect its principles. Breeding is at the same time essential to allow the farmers to reach good productive results and efficient use of the resources under organic production conditions.
Proposals should plan breeding programs under organic aquaculture for the main European aquaculture finfish species, i.e. seabass, seabream, trout and salmon. They should breed organic juveniles under organic production conditions respecting high animal welfare standards (as set in regulation 2018/848 and Implementing Regulation 2020/464) and should aim to improve species resilience, diseases resistances and feed efficiency satisfying nutritional needs using as much as possible alternative feed materials to increase production sustainability.
Proposals should work on different species and/or different climatic areas tailored to the specificity of the organic aquaculture production and carefully analyse each solution not only in terms of performance but also in terms of the welfare of the farmed animals. They should work on preserving genetic diversity and adaptive potential by developing selective breeding programmes considering interactions between genotypes and rearing systems.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-02-1-two-stage," Demonstrating Nature-based Solutions for the sustainable management of water resources in a changing climate, with special attention to reducing the impacts of extreme droughts",2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 8.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, notably the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, as well as the EU climate adaptation strategy and the EU's climate mitigation ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposals will support the development of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) contributing to the sustainable management of water resources in a changing climate, with a special attention to reducing the impacts of extreme droughts.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	Cost-effective ways of implementing NBS at large scale for integrated water management are ready to use for relevant stakeholders and widely replicated;
?	Consolidated evidence of the contribution of NBS to sustainable water management and of NBS? cost and resource efficiency, notably concerning the reduction of impacts of droughts;
?	Enhanced implementation of EU policies, notably for water management (Water Framework Directive, as well as the Floods Directive, when relevant), climate adaptation (Article 5 of the European Climate Law, EU strategy for climate change adaptation), the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU soil strategy for 2030.
Scope: Due to the changing climate, many European regions are already facing more frequent, severe, and longer lasting droughts. Extreme droughts can have cascading effects; e.g., they reduce water levels in rivers and ground water, stunt tree and crop growth, increase pest attacks, favour the occurrence of sand drifts and storms and fuel wildfires. Moreover, impacts of extreme droughts accumulate over time across large areas, and the effect can linger for years. In areas with an intense demand for water supply, the impacts of droughts add up to the stress imposed to water systems by human activities.
In Europe, most of the losses caused by extreme drought (~EUR 9 billion/year) affect agriculture, forestry the energy sector and the public water supply. Extreme droughts in western and central Europe in 2018, 2019 and 2020 caused considerable damage. With global climate change deepening, the impacts will be even more severe in the future, including decreasing quality, occurrence and availability of standing and running water.
By deploying systemic thinking NBS utilise an understanding of the structure and functioning of local ecosystems over time to address a broad range of societal challenges, including having enough water of good quality, both in surface waters and in ground water. They also contribute to restoration of biodiversity and help carbon sequestration in the soil. As such, NBS are highly adaptable to respond to changing local conditions and are often more cost and resource efficient than purely technological approaches in the longer term.
The 2021 EU climate adaptation strategy underlines that NBS represent multipurpose, ?no regret? solutions, with environmental, social and economic benefits and help build climate resilience. They can have an essential role in land-use management and infrastructure planning to reduce costs, provide climate-resilient services, and improve compliance with Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements.
However, evidence on the cost-efficiency of these measures remains dispersed and incomplete, and do not address the whole catchment area in a holistic approach. River basin management plans are still limited in the recognition of NBS capacity to contribute to drought resilience. Furthermore, we are still missing more and longer-term evidence of the combined effects of different designs and combinations of NBS operating in different contexts (urban, peri-urban and rural) and/or at different scales and/or different climatic zones, in what regards the sustainable management of water resources to reduce the impacts of extreme droughts. At the same time, the co-benefit that these NBS may bring to reduce hydrogeological risks such as flood peaking and stabilising hydrographs for both droughts and floods is still to be demonstrated.
The successful proposals should:
?	Demonstrate innovative, systemic and locally attuned NBS (as single interventions or as a combination of them), for the management of catchment water resources and the reduction of extreme drought risks, in areas that are heavily impacted by temporary or lasting water scarcity and areas that are being increasingly exposed to this risk with the deepening of climate change.
?	Be incorporated into an integrated design concept for land and water management at the appropriate scales (preferably at landscape level, integrating water, soil and ecosystems as a whole), in accordance with WFD objectives, considering longitudinal connectivity of water flows, lateral connectivity with floodplains and adjacent grounds, and connections between surface- and groundwater.
?	Plan, co-design and co-deploy solutions in a transdisciplinary multi-stakeholder and participatory context with due consideration and integration of social and cultural aspects and climate change effects.
?	Building on the work of Horizon 2020 projects and their taskforces, develop an advanced monitoring programme for the demonstrated solutions and test and further develop as needed the EU Impact Evaluation Framework for NBS to assess the economic, social and ecological benefits of NBS and provide quantitative evidence, including positive and negative synergies, and analysis of trade-offs, for higher performance.
?	Identify and assess barriers related to: functional conflicts in land-use; NBS technical, commercial, social and cultural acceptance (e.g., farmers perceptions and values, the role of private landowners); and policy regulatory frameworks (e.g., the role of the common agriculture policy, urban, rural and regional development plans) - and propose ways to overcome them (for example through new business cases and governance approaches).
?	Develop methodologies and tools, adapted to end-users (e.g., farmers, forest owners, local authorities, engineers, spatial planners), enabling the replication and up-scaling of NBS.
?	To provide a long-term evidence as ambitious as possible, new interventions should be complemented with the analysis of established NBS. In this respect, opportunities to build up from relevant initiatives should be explored (e.g., LIFE, INTERREG, national funded projects, etc).
?	Develop protocols and standards for the design, operation and maintenance of NBS, building on existing work, considering:
?	The best solutions for different soil characteristics (as these determine the type and impact of droughts) and soil health, relief and geo-morphological conditions, including urban conditions;
?	The resilience of NBS, considering present and future climatic conditions and water regimes;
?	The ecological performance and resilience of NBS, to deal with both natural and human-induced hazards, such as extreme weather events, desertification, forest fires, plant- and animal diseases (pests), other human activities and socio-political approaches that could have an impact on land-use;
?	The long-term maintenance of NBS: also in relation to the adequate management of biomass, synergies with other approaches that affect the management of ecosystems like agroforestry, etc.
Proposals should address all of the above points.
Because of the substantial investments that might be necessary for implementing the NBS, additional or follow-up funding (private or public) should be sought, considering the EU taxonomy, including from relevant regional/national schemes under the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), or other relevant funds. Please note, however, that reference to such additional or follow-up funding will not lead automatically to a higher score in the evaluation of the proposal.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. This means proposals should bring together from the early start multiple types of scientific expertise in both natural sciences (e.g., ecology, climate, pedology) and social sciences and humanities (e.g., economics, geography, sociology) together with a variety of urban and/or rural community representatives, farmers, businesses, civil society organisations and citizens.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic and any other relevant topic/call, by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities. This includes notably the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio, including the European Green Deal Call, and its task forces; Horizon Europe projects Invest4Nature and Naturance and HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03: Network for nature: multi-stakeholder dialogue platform to promote nature-based solutions. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities without the prerequisite to define concrete common actions at this stage.
Proposals should ensure complementarity and foresee synergies with the activities of the Horizon Europe missions ""A Soil Deal for Europe?, ?Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030? and ?Adaptation to Climate Change?, as well as with the partnerships Biodiversa+ and Water4All.
Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outputs will be accessible through the Oppla portal (the EU repository for NBS). Where relevant, proposals should consider creating links, contributing to and using the information and data of other platforms such as NWRM, Climate-ADAPT, BISE and the European Drought Observatory.",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-02-2-two-stage," Demonstrating the potential of Nature-based Solutions and the New European Bauhaus to contribute to sustainable, inclusive and resilient living spaces and communities",2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the EU climate adaptation strategy, as well as the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050 and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the successful proposals will support the development of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) contributing to the resilience and the sustainable, balanced and inclusive development of urban, peri-urban and rural areas.
The overall aim of this topic and associated R&I activities is to leverage the New European Bauhaus (NEB) core values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics in Nature-based Solutions (NBS), in light of a wider transformation to enable a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient society.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	A transdisciplinary integration of NBS and the NEB is demonstrated in different contexts, contributing to the transformative change needed to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises, and drawing on inclusiveness and the pluralities of values, knowledge, cultural diversity and cultural heritage.
?	High quality, multifunctional, co-created public spaces that enhance sustainability, resilience and the well-being of communities, through the combination of NBS and the NEB, with digital, social and cultural innovation.
?	Greater understanding of the links between NBS and the NEB and how to better make these two approaches compatible and integrated in places and buildings, landscapes, industrial systems, policies and communities.
?	Communities benefit from the implementation of a new societal vision encompassing sustainability, resilience, health, well-being and inclusion, based on the demonstration of the combination of the NEB with NBS.
Scope: NBS can be an integral part of our living spaces that contribute to our well-being, promote togetherness and connect to our cultural heritage. There is growing evidence that NBS are a valuable entry for transforming behaviour towards sustainability, while contributing with multiple benefits that help communities address different societal challenges ? from microclimate regulation to climate change, water management, green job creation, tourism opportunities, urban regeneration, health and well-being.
The NEB aims to make the European Green Deal a positive and tangible experience for citizens, connecting it to our daily lives and living spaces. It is a bridge between the world of science and technology, art and culture and is about leveraging our green and digital challenges to transform our lives and society. By integrating the values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics/quality of experience, the NEB supports the development of holistic solutions to global challenges through a place-based, participatory, and transdisciplinary approach.
The systemic integration of social, cultural, digital and nature-based innovation in the design, development and governance of public space has a tremendous potential to transform these spaces into diverse, accessible, safe, inclusive and high-quality areas that increase well-being and health and deliver a fair and equitable distribution of the associated benefits.
It becomes important to analyse the potential of NBS in view of the NEB initiative and conceptualise and demonstrate how to link these two approaches, avoid trade-offs, and enhance synergies and complementarities, through local demonstration. In this regard, proposals should focus on the first transformation of the NEB (places), while also integrating, when possible, the other two transformations (ecosystem of innovation; diffusion of new meanings) in the process.
The successful proposals should:
?	Deliver visionary and integrated solutions combining nature-based innovation and social, cultural, or digital solutions, with the NEB approach, in order to increase sustainability and resilience of communities and citizens' well-being. These solutions should address environmental, social, cultural, economic determinants of resilience and well-being and support communities in reducing their exposure to climate-related risks, pollution (including noise) and social tensions.
?	Demonstrate how the integration of NBS and NEB in solutions for innovative land-use management, urban design and planning could enhance ecosystem services, foster equitable access to public spaces, enhance their quality and use, or promote sustainable mobility.
?	Considering the existing NBS portfolio, further demonstrate NBS, enriched with the new elements brought by the NEB (e.g., aesthetics, quality of experience), as well as with concerns on the circularity, ecodesign, origin and sustainability of materials used. These solutions should be applied in innovative configurations, e.g., in protected areas, eco-tourism sites, transport infrastructure, educational and cultural buildings, etc, notably contributing to urban regeneration, tourism opportunities, green job creation, social inclusion, or health and well-being.
?	Considering that NBS inherently should always enhance biodiversity, explore the connections and possible trade-offs (and propose ways to overcome them) between biodiversity targets in NBS and the NEB, including in what concerns functionality and aesthetics/quality of experience.
?	Propose solutions that involve innovative ways to make NBS compatible with built cultural heritage (e.g., cultural landscapes), and explore the possible role of NBS in increasing built cultural heritage?s resilience to climate change and natural disasters.
?	Propose and test guidelines and innovative tools for the implementation, maintenance, monitoring and evaluation of NBS integrating the NEB approach (e.g., addressing issues of design/ergonomics or quality of experience), as well as the necessary business and governance models for their implementation and upscaling (e.g. local incentives for NBS in public and private spaces; exploring different forms of engagement, inclusion and stewardship, etc).
?	Building on the approach of the NEB, develop place based NBS with strong citizen engagement (e.g., youth, elder, vulnerable communities), through social innovation, and the necessary tools for citizen participation and the co-creation of solutions.
?	Incorporate outreach, dissemination and cooperation activities with local communities, industry, educational institutions, research centres, professional organisations or museums and other cultural organisations, supporting challenge-based and experiential NBS with real-life NEB applications, promoting public debate and a change of behaviour.
?	Engage, through sustainable transdisciplinary collaborations, communities of practice that very rarely work together (e.g., architects, landscape architects, designers, artists, ecologists, spatial planners, psychologists, economists, or engineers), bridging epistemological gaps, while also contributing to the breaking up of silos in local/regional administrations.
?	Explore the role of NBS and NEB in transformative change to provide holistic solutions to address global challenges (climate, biodiversity, water, economic, demographic, etc), including through transformative and contemporary arts.
Proposals should address all of the above points.
For wider impact, proposals should ensure a diversity of demonstration contexts (e.g., urban, rural, protected areas) and geographical representation, as well as the inclusion of a diversity of actors for local demonstration: local and/or regional authorities, business, academia, and civil society.
Other than the critical role of ecological sciences, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. The involvement of disciplines such as psychology, behavioural science, economics, geography, anthropology, sociology, architecture, arts, cultural heritage, or design studies, is considered essential to the diffusion of new meanings, enhance social learning and promote the role of social and cultural innovation in transforming public spaces, with particular attention to inclusion, quality of experience and cultural perceptions of nature.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership, or market uptake.
Because of the substantial investments that might be necessary for implementing the NBS, additional or follow-up funding (private or public) should be sought, including from relevant regional/national schemes under the Recovery and Resilience Fund, the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), or other relevant funds.
Projects should envisage clustering activities with the projects of the same topic and with the Horizon 2020 NBS project portfolio and respective task forces and notably coordinate with Horizon Europe projects resulting from: HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-01-05: Assessing the socio-politics of nature-based solutions for more inclusive and resilient communities; HORIZON-CL6-2022-COMMUNITIES-02-02-two-stage: Developing nature-based therapy for health and well-being; HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-03: Network for nature: multi-stakeholder dialogue platform to promote nature-based solutions; and HORIZON-CL6-2023-BIODIV-01-8: Addressing biodiversity decline and promoting Nature-based Solutions in higher education. Collaboration with the European Biodiversity Partnership (Biodiversa+) should also be explored. To this end, proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and appropriate resources for coordination measures, foresee joint activities and joint deliverables.
Proposals should build on existing outcomes of the Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe NBS project portfolio and other NEB related projects funded in Horizon Europe and ensure the proposed activities are complementary. Complementarity should also be sought with Horizon Europe Missions, notably ?100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030?, ?Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030? and ?Adaptation to Climate Change?.
Projects are expected to contribute to the NEB initiative by interacting with the NEB Community, NEBLab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practice, and, where relevant, results.
Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information, and project outputs will be accessible through the Oppla portal (the EU repository for Nature-based solutions).

HORIZON-CL6-2024-BIODIV-02-3-two-stage, Promoting minor crops in farming systems,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies, successful proposals will promote diversification in agriculture as a means to increase the resilience and sustainability of the sector vis-a-vis challenging environmental, climatic and economic conditions. By increasing agrobiodiversity, activities will contribute to food security, adaptation of the agricultural production to the effects of climate change, and thereby support implementation of the farm to fork strategy, the common agricultural policy and the EU climate policy under the European Green Deal.
Successful proposals will contribute to the following outcomes:
?	Increased evidence of the environmental benefits of minor crops;
?	Farmers make use of a wider range of crops, and combination of crops;
?	Minor crops are integrated in farming systems promoting their environmental benefits;
?	Increased resilience and climate adaptation of farming systems vis-a-vis biotic and abiotic stresses;
?	Feed and food industry make use of minor crops;
?	Creation of new avenues for farmers and value chains through a wider range of products.
Scope: Farmers face increasing pressure to shift production towards lower input systems, while continuing to ensure sufficient supplies of food and non-food products. The European Green Deal in particular has set ambitious targets to reduce by 2030 the overall use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers, reduce nutrient losses and increase organic farming . Activities shall release the value of minor crops and promote their broader use in breeding, farming and in food/non-food value chains. For the purpose of this topic, minor crops are defined as underutilised and/or genetically diverse crops  (including landraces and varieties).
?	Promote the access to minor crops engaging in breeding activities;
?	Improve agronomic management practices for minor crops;
?	Explore the effects and benefits of minor crops and demonstrate the ecosystems services supported by farming system diversification and the integration of minor crops (if applicable, including novel crop rotations).
?	Identify and test avenues for marketing and processing of more diverse farming outputs across the value chain;
?	Promote the uptake of minor crops through the development of guidelines and wide-spread practical demonstrations taking into account a range of farming systems, pedo-climatic conditions and value chains;
?	Support capacity building, training and education enabling farmers/growers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices.
The topic is open to all types of farming systems (e.g., arable farming, horticulture, fruit trees) in various geographical and pedo-climatic conditions. Result of activities should benefit both conventional and organic agriculture.
Activities must implement the multi-actor approach, thus ensure an adequate involvement of researchers, farmers, advisors, food industry, and other players in the value chain and consumers. Communication and outreach to a wide range of stakeholders is essential. This topic should include the effective contribution of SSH disciplines.
Where relevant, proposals should seek complementarities and synergies, while avoiding duplication and overlap, with relevant actions funded under Horizon 2020 . Proposals should specify how they plan to collaborate with other proposals selected under this and other relevant topics, for example by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to cover these activities.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-1, European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition ? agroecology living labs and research infrastructures,4/12/2023,COFUND,12/22/2022,,,Around 60.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal, this partnership will contribute to the objectives and targets of the new common agricultural policy (CAP), and of the EU farm to fork strategy for a transition to fair, healthy, environmentally-friendly and more resilient food systems from primary production to consumption, and in particular pursuing the ambition to boost agroecology. Moreover, the Commission Communication ?Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems?  highlights innovation through agroecology as one of the tools that can mitigate pressure on input costs without hurting production capacity, leading to long-term progress in productivity. Agroecology is a dynamic and holistic approach that contributes positively to healthier ecosystems and biodiversity, including in soils. Agroecology aims at supporting the transition of agri-food systems towards more sustainable practices by connecting science, practice and society and by triggering the adoption of a set of policies to promote sustainable agricultural practices. Given the potential of agroecology to deliver positive impacts for the transition towards environmental, climate, economic and social sustainability of Europe?s farming systems, the partnership will deliver solutions that will support the implementation of several other European Green Deal strategies and initiatives, notably: the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030; the action plan for the development of organic production; the EU zero pollution action plan; the 2030 climate target pact; the EU soil strategy for 2030, the sustainable carbon cycles, and the EU bioeconomy strategy. The partnership will constitute a unique instrument that will help connect agroecological research across Europe. Its expected outcomes will contribute to the impacts of various Destinations under Cluster 6 of Horizon Europe, notably Destination ?Fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption?, as well as to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDGs 2, 3, 6, 12, 13 and 15.
The partnership?s activities are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased capacities of farmers and actors of the land-based primary production value chains across Europe to implement agroecological practices that contribute to sustainable ecological, climate, environmental and productivity impacts, and to inclusive, competitive and resilient agri-food systems.
?	A Europe-wide network of existing and new agroecology living laboratories and research infrastructures is set. Knowledge sharing and multi-stakeholder co-creation of agroecological innovations at various scales is ensured. A framework for data management, indicators, and tools to monitor agroecology transition is put in place.
?	A robust European R&I system for agroecology integrating science and practice is put in place. The direction for expanding existing and building up new collaborations, boosting knowledge creation and sharing, and co-creating place-based and tailored solutions through agroecology living laboratories (?living labs?) and research infrastructures is set. The understandings of the technical and socio-economic performance and the uptake of agroecology in Europe are improved.
?	The science-policy dialogue on agroecology is strengthened. Scientific support and technical demonstrations for the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of relevant EU policies is provided. Evidence-based, systems-oriented and transformative governance and policy-making are supported.
?	EU and national/regional agroecological research and innovation agendas from the EU and Member States and Associated Countries are complementary, leading to the co-creation and implementation of a long-term pan-European strategic research and innovation agenda.
Scope: The European partnership on ?Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures? is one of the actions included in the farm to fork strategy, which calls for the promotion of agroecology as one of the sustainable farming approaches with capacity to help meet the European Green Deal objectives in relation to agri-food systems. Living laboratories are multi-stakeholder, real-life settings that place the user at the centre of innovation and operate as instruments for farmers, research organisations, companies, citizens, local and regional authorities, etc., for the co-creation of solutions following a multi-method approach. Agroecology living labs are characterised by very strong local embeddedness, multi-stakeholder involvement by a large diversity of origins, and knowledge intensiveness in the pursuit of and the innovations needed and produced. They can operate at different scales: typically farm, landscape or regional levels. Research infrastructures provide a wide range of services for research communities working in a long- term perspective.
The partnership should coordinate research and innovation programmes on agroecology between the EU and its Member States and Associated Countries and trigger combined actions. It should mobilise key partners and stakeholders, including ministries, funding agencies, research performing organisations, regions, local authorities, research infrastructures, living laboratories, farmers, advisors, industry, consumers, etc.
The partnership?s co-created Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) should include calls for research projects and activities to boost place-based and multi-stakeholder co-creation of solutions. As such, it should boost fundamental research on agroecology through to applied research, and should give rise to ready-to-use solutions for scaling up in real-life environments. The partnership should cover issues pertaining to the transition to agroecology in all agricultural production systems, including but not limited to conventional agriculture, organic farming, agroforestry, permaculture, regenerative agriculture, urban farming, etc. Ultimately, the partnership should significantly contribute to filling existing knowledge gaps on agroecology, addressing geographical/territorial specificities in the EU and Associated Countries.
Delivering on the partnership?s ambitions requires the implementation of the following portfolio of activities to be achieved during the partnership?s lifetime:
?	Support transnational research and innovation activities, as defined in its SRIA, on the challenges and potential of agroecology in addressing biophysical, climate, social and economic dimensions of sustainability, as well as for reducing environmental impact and resource use, at farming, local environment and broader societal levels. This should include supporting research in and on agroecology living labs as tools to foster agroecology transition.
?	Build a European network of new and existing living labs and research infrastructures for knowledge sharing and co-creation of agroecology innovations, at various scales. The network will constitute a key platform for the development and co-creation of innovations to address the technical, economic, institutional and policy-related challenges of agroecology transition for both individuals and collectives across Europe.
?	Improve access to and use of services provided by research infrastructures and other relevant initiatives, for long-term measurement, observation and experimentation in support of agroecology.
?	Improve the sharing and access to knowledge and innovation on agroecology, and improve the capacities of farmers and actors of the agri-food chain to take up agroecology innovations, as well as reinforce the agricultural knowledge and innovation systems for agroecology across Europe, considering culture, gender, and youth aspects.
?	Build a monitoring and data framework with indicators and tools to monitor and measure the progress of agroecology transition, its social, economic, environmental and climate performances and impacts, and improve data valorisation and sharing.
?	Put in place robust mechanisms for science-policy dialogue to support the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies (research and sectorial) with a view to contributing to improved governance and policies, as well as institutions that are better equipped to support agroecological transition.
?	Design and implement communication, knowledge sharing and dissemination activities to improve stakeholder and wider public engagement in agroecology transition.
The partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to Countries Associated to Horizon Europe. Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contribution, in line with the level of ambition of the proposed activities. The partnership should be open to include new partners over its lifetime. Its governance should allow for engaging a broad range of stakeholders, together with the full members of the partnership. Guidelines, standards and legislation in the field should be taken into consideration, to facilitate the marketing of the methods and products developed in the partnership.
To ensure that all work streams are coherent and complementary, and to leverage knowledge and innovation investment potential, the partnership is expected to foster close cooperation and synergies with the Horizon Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?, with the existing European Partnership Biodiversa+, and with other relevant future partnerships, in particular Sustainable food systems, Agriculture of data, and Animal health and welfare.
Cooperation with the JRC may be envisaged, in particular for actions related to monitoring and measuring progress of agroecology transition, as well as for improving data valorisation. The JRC may provide expertise on EU-wide data and indicators to monitor agroecology transition.
The partnership should allocate resources to cooperate with existing projects, initiatives, platforms, science-policy interfaces, and/or institutional processes at EU level, and at other levels where relevant to the partnership?s goals.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. The partnership will provide financial support to third parties as one of the means to achieve its objectives. To explore the full range of financing options available under Horizon Europe, the general annexes of the main Work Programme setting out the general conditions applicable to calls and topics for grants should be considered.
To achieve the international cooperation objectives, and given the global dimension of agroecology, collaboration with strategic third country partners with proven added value in the field of agroecology transition is strongly encouraged. In particular, the participation of legal entities from international countries and/or regions, including those not automatically eligible for funding, is encouraged in the joint calls and/or in other activities of the partnership. Cooperation with international organisations may be considered.
Applicants are expected to describe in detail how they would carry out this collaborative work in practice.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-3, Improving yields in organic cropping systems,4/12/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal should support the objectives of the farm to fork strategy to transition to fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption, notably the objective to promote and increase organic farming  in Europe, in line with the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies? target of at least 25% of the EU?s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030 and a significant uptake of agroecological practices. Activities will support the implementation of specific actions in the action plan for the development of organic production . Given the potential of organic farming to contribute to the EU?s climate ambition, this topic will contribute to the objective of a climate-neutral land sector by 2035 and a climate-neutral economy by 2050.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased and accelerated availability, accessibility and adoption of strategies and approaches that improve yields of crops grown under organic conditions, including organic-targeted plant breeding
?	Enhanced climate, environmental and economic performance of organic farming systems
?	Increased networking and knowledge exchange among all relevant actors in the Member States and Associated Countries, contributing to a strengthened research and innovation ecosystem of organic production in Europe
?	Provision of data, scientific support and recommendations for the development, implementation and evaluation of EU policies and initiatives relevant for organic production
Scope: Promoting the use of more sustainable farming practices is a EU policy objective enshrined in the European Green Deal and its related strategies. Boosting organic farming, one of the objectives of the farm to fork and of the EU biodiversity strategies, can greatly contribute to achieving this ambition. Moreover, the Communication ?Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems?  highlights the role that organic farming can play in reducing EU?s dependence on external inputs.
Reaching at least 25% of the EU?s agricultural land under organic farming will require among other elements, a significant increase in current conversion rates. One of the obstacles that hinders conversion to organic farming is the fact that several crops grown under organic conditions achieve lower yields per hectare as compared with those produced under conventional farming practices. Closing the yield gap is therefore important in order to further improve the economic competitiveness and resilience of the sector, as well as to increase farmers? adoption of organic production
At the same time, closing of the yield gap should not compromise the principles and objectives of organic farming, in particular with regard to the recycling of nutrients. Moreover, it is important that approaches and strategies aiming at bridging the yield gap in organic farming are holistic and take into consideration the implications on the entire farming system.
By using a participatory approach, proposals should set up a European-wide network of testing, experimentation and demonstration sites to test, co-create and showcase practices and strategies that improve yields of crops produced under organic conditions. In this context, proposals should:
?	Identify the most relevant crops in organic production for which yields can be sustainably improved in the short term, and propose crop-specific strategies with due attention to local and site-specific practices. This should consider cost-effectiveness analysis comparing with conventional farming production, in order to evaluate the economical sustainability of the strategies proposed.
?	Give due attention to holistic approaches, such as those that contribute to improving organic-tailored plant varieties and appropriate use of breeds and varieties, and building soil fertility and optimal nutrient management (e.g., integrated plant-animal production systems, use of manure as fertiliser, nutrient recycling, introduction of crop rotations and intercropping, use of leguminous crops, circular approaches for maintaining and increasing soil organic matter, locally-specific optimization of water use, etc.). Nursery techniques for the production of suitable organic plant reproductive material should also be considered.
?	Organise and implement advisory activities, exchange of knowledge and best practices as well as dissemination of results, including the development of practical guidelines and decision-support tools for farmers. These activities should also engage farmers involved in low-input farming, agro-ecological or circular farming, to facilitate cross-fertilisation and mutual learning.
?	Identify remaining gaps (including normative gaps where relevant) and prepare a research and innovation roadmap to boost yields of crops produced under organic conditions. For these activities, proposals should ensure collaboration with relevant activities carried out under other actions in Horizon Europe, and ensure coherence with and contribution to the Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda of the future partnership ??Accelerating farming systems transition: agro-ecology living labs and research infrastructures?? and its successive updates.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach? and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders (farmers, breeders, researchers, advisors, industry, etc.). Proposals should cover a representative range of pedo-climatic conditions across Europe and a wide range of crops (arable and perennial) reflecting the diversity of the European organic plant production sector. Proposals should ensure synergies and build on the results from previous and/or ongoing research projects. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, including under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE: ?Developing an EU advisory network on organic agriculture?, HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE: ?Organic farming thematic network to compile and share knowledge ready for practice?, and the future partnership ?Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures?. In order to better address some or all of the expected outcomes, as well as to promote learning and cross-fertilisation with activities carried out outside of Europe, international cooperation is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-4, Towards research and innovation beyond farm to fork strategy targets for pesticides after 2030,4/12/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 1.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal should support the implementation of the farm to fork strategy, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU climate policy under the European Green Deal. Activities will contribute to the transition to fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food systems from primary production to consumption, notably the target to reduce by 50% the overall use and risk of chemical pesticides and reduce the use by 50% of the more hazardous pesticides.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved understanding of main knowledge gaps as well as of drivers and barriers to go beyond the farm to fork targets for chemical pesticides;
?	Increased networking and knowledge exchange across Europe promoting a reduction in pesticide use and risk beyond the farm to fork targets;
?	Research needs for further reductions or phasing out chemical pesticides in agriculture are identified.
Scope: The use of chemical pesticides in agriculture harm non-target organisms including humans, contaminates the soil, water and the wider environment, and cause biodiversity decline in agricultural areas. The European Green Deal has set new targets and defined a roadmap to reach its objectives through multiple strategies and action plans, including the farm to fork and the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030. Ambitious targets have been set for agriculture, namely the goal of reducing by 50% the use and risks of chemical pesticides, as well as the use of more hazardous pesticides, by 2030.
Research has shown that well-designed integrated pest management programmes can control weeds and pests in an ecologically friendly manner; however, today?s farming still relies significantly on chemical treatments to ensure farm yields and profits. A key challenge is to assess the impact on sustainability (environmental, social, economic) of going beyond these 2030 targets of pesticide reduction aiming for further reductions or even phasing out chemical pesticides in EU agriculture, starting with the most hazardous ones, while sustainably coping with the consequences of climate change, such as heat, drought and extreme precipitation, or pressure from invasive pests and diseases. In order to achieve this, a stronger R&I ecosystem should be put in place that would be able to contribute with sustainable solutions, assess the challenges of further reductions or phasing out chemical pesticides on food systems, including food security and affordability, and connect the different ongoing efforts and initiatives.
Proposals should:
?	Establish a network that promotes close cooperation among relevant research and innovation actors (including social sciences) and networks across the EU and Associated Countries;
?	Provide a comprehensive analysis and understanding of knowledge gaps and new research paradigms to be addressed towards a sustainable (and beyond farm to fork targets) agriculture;
?	Identify, map and foster pesticide use and risk reduction related activities in the EU, Associated Countries and worldwide, including programmes and demonstration facilities, all along the agri-food chain;
?	Identify the challenges and opportunities for primary producers and other actors of the agri-food chain to drive the transition towards a sustainable (and beyond farm to fork targets) agriculture;
?	Provide recommendations on the future research needs in agricultural sciences, as well as in technical, social, economic and policy sciences, aiming for further reductions or phasing out chemical pesticides in agriculture taking in consideration climate change, increased pressure from pests and diseases, and other challenges.
Proposals should consider arable and perennial crops. Proposals should build and capitalise on the outcomes of other relevant EU-funded research projects and initiatives under Horizon 2020 , Horizon Europe , and other programmes/initiatives (such as COST actions, PRIMA). Activities should ensure alignment and complementarity with those carried out under the future partnership ?Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures? and the European Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?. Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sector, researchers, farmers, advisory services, agri-food industries, consumers and NGOs are brought together",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-5, Advancing vaccine development for African swine fever,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will support research and innovation to help policy makers and economic operators reduce the burden of African swine fever (ASF), thus contributing to a safeguarding animal health and the economic resilience of the sustainable livestock industry.
Activities under this topic will contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved capacity to develop ASF pilot vaccines and their companion DIVA tests for the possible prevention and/or eradication of the disease in domestic pigs and wild boars;
?	Vaccination strategies for both wild boar and domestic pigs, addressing different objectives and needs (e.g. eradication in wild boar; emergency or preventive use in domestic pigs).
?	Increased international cooperation on a possible ASF vaccine.
Scope: ASF is a devastating viral disease that has showed its potential for very serious and rapid spread, not only in Europe, but throughout the world. It has a serious socio-economic impact on farming sector and is of major importance in the international trade of animals and animal products. While strict control measures including in particular biosecurity, culling of infected pigs, appropriate management of wild-boar populations, have contributed to reduced spread of the disease, concerns are raised on the possibility to eradicate the disease without vaccination in the long-term.
Global research efforts are starting to show some promising results, but further work on the development of effective and safe ASF vaccines is needed, as an additional tool to re-inforce control and eradication strategies currently in place.
All the following elements should be incorporated:
?	Address the necessary steps for developing pilot vaccines against ASF for domestic pigs and wild boars;
?	Address the necessary steps to develop companion DIVA tests, where feasible.
?	Decipher pathogen genetics/genomics and immune response of the host, to develop innovative approaches to African swine fever vaccine development, at least including those virus types circulating in Europe. Study different types of vaccines and modern techniques to develop novel ASF vaccines;
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged in particular with North America.
The selected project should take into consideration the EU animal health regulatory framework.
Proposals should ensure adequate involvement of stakeholders from the European Medicines Agency, veterinary authorities, farmers and hunters. Involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is highly recommended.
While it is expected that proposals will present innovative approaches to ASF vaccine development, the projects could consider the relevant activities and outputs of past or ongoing EU funded research, such as VACDIVA  and DEFEND , and of other international projects on ASF vaccine and build on them where appropriate. They should contribute to the relevant objectives of the Star-Idaz International Consortium",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-6, Towards sustainable livestock systems:  European platform for evidence building and transitioning policy,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Increasing sustainability, viability and resilience of climate friendly agricultural production are key objectives of the farm to fork strategy. The adoption and enhancement of more biodiversity-friendly farming systems is among the objectives of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030. In line with these objectives, the successful proposal will support policy makers with science-based evidence on the impacts and externalities of livestock farming as part of the food system and wider ecosystem.
Activities under this topic will contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Assembled collation of comparable and sound data on positive and negative impacts and externalities from the terrestrial livestock sector in accordance with internationally agreed methodology
?	Quantitative, qualitative and monetized evidence of the social, economic and environmental impacts and externalities of different livestock production systems (extensive, intensive, organic, different animal species), and their relation to particular food systems (e.g., short supply, circular, market oriented?) as well as trade-offs/synergies assessed at farming and landscape scale
?	Recommendations/policy advice on more effective tools in mitigating negative externalities and increasing positive externalities in different terrestrial livestock production systems
?	Ensured more intensive and broader communication and dissemination of evidence-based knowledge in the EU and beyond, and make it accessible to all stakeholders groups, citizens and civil society at large.
Scope: The current debate on positive or negative impact and values of animal production is based on abundant contradictory data and on the difficulties in quantifying natural processes linked to agricultural production and land use. Negative and positive impacts and externalities, including potential trade-offs, should be deeply investigated in different types of farming systems, practices and environments. The project will build on a wide range of scientific information, reports, expert opinions and other available material such as databases.
The following elements should be incorporated:
?	Provide a comprehensive study on the positive and negative impacts and externalities of terrestrial livestock farming systems in different social, economic and environmental contexts across Europe at farm, landscape and regional levels
?	Mapping of research and innovation projects as well as complementary initiatives, vision papers and reports on impact and externalities of different terrestrial livestock farming systems (extensive, intensive, organic, different animal species) within different food systems
?	Develop methods and indicators to measure the scale, range and degree of identified externalities in different livestock systems
?	Generate data on the aggregated effects of environmental, social and economic externalities available to allow the assessment of net global impact. Elaborate potential scenarios at national, regional levels through the use of existing or improved modelling
?	Improve the understanding of the co-benefit of livestock systems for biodiversity and ecosystem services, land use/change, circularity, GHG emissions/savings, energy consumption, air/water/soil quality, human diet/health, animal health and welfare, food and nutritional security
?	Provide new and improved evidence to support decision makers, public authorities, other organizations and stakeholders in the assessment of the socio-economic and environmental impacts and externalities of terrestrial livestock production systems around Europe, building on the specific elements above
?	Communicate sciencebased evidence of the impacts of terrestrial livestock systems on climate, environment, biodiversity and ecosystem services as well as potential for improvement towards sustainable livestock systems. The socio-economic dimension should be considered.
In order to better address some or all of the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The project will seek to engage a dialogue with and feed into any relevant structure or organization at European level and beyond such as Standing Committee on Agricultural Research (SCAR) , FAO, Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance Partnership (LEAP, FAO) , Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock (GASL) , etc.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach? and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in terrestrial livestock production systems and their sustainability (e.g., farmers, advisory services, policy makers, producers, land managers, ecology and nature conservation experts, social scientists and other relevant actors).
This topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-7, Innovations in plant protection:  alternatives to reduce the use of pesticides focusing on candidates for substitution,4/12/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal should support the farm to fork strategy to transition to fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption, notably the target to reduce by 50% the overall use and risk of chemical pesticides and reduce the use by 50% of the more hazardous pesticides by 2030.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased availability of widely accessible and cost-efficient alternatives for prevention and (bio)control of plant pest with improved environmental performance (e.g., reduced effects on non-target organisms, natural resources, humans and the environment);
?	Reduced reliance on hazardous plant protection products and favour low risk plant protection solutions, to sustain crop productivity and food security while contributing to sustainable agriculture and/or forestry;
?	Minimized pesticides impact on human and animal health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, drinking water, soils and the food chain.
Scope: The use of chemical pesticides in agriculture contributes to soil, water and air pollution, biodiversity loss and can harm non-target plants, insects, birds, mammals and amphibians. The Commission is taking action to reduce the overall use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50% and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50% by 2030. Significant efforts are required to develop alternatives to critical active substances used in plant protection. Active substances with certain properties defined in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are considered as candidates for substitution . For Plant Protection Products (PPPs) containing these active substances, Member States are required, when assessing an application for authorisation, to evaluate if these PPPs can be replaced (substituted) by other adequate solutions (chemical or non-chemical). Proposals should target one or more pesticides candidates for substitution in the EU and those pesticides which have been reported to be losing their efficiency due to the emergence of resistant pests.
Proposals should:
?	Develop and test alternative approaches, tools, strategies, agents, and/or substances (either conventional, natural-based, or biological) for prevention (promoting prophylaxis measures) and/or (bio) control of plant pest  with improved environmental performance (e.g., reduced effects on non-target organisms, natural resources and the environment) and acceptable efficacy, enlarging the toolbox of integrated pest management (IPM);
?	Improve current agronomic, ecological, cultural, and traditional practices to increase the resilience of agricultural production against biotic stresses;
?	Assess the social, economic and environmental issues associated with the proposed innovative solution, including trade-offs, the impact on labour, safety culture, and risk management on farms;
?	Demonstrate the safety of alternatives in accordance with established scientific risk assessment methodology and relevant EU regulatory frameworks related to their manufacturing and placing on the market.
?	Set up demonstration sites in Europe to promote participatory demonstration activities, and the exchange of knowledge and best practices among farmers.
?	Support capacity building, training and education enabling farmers/growers to the proposed solution reducing the use and risk of pesticides.
Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as researchers, farmers, advisors, and industry including SMEs are brought together.
Where relevant, proposals should seek complementarities and synergies, while avoiding duplication and overlap, with relevant actions funded under Horizon 2020 . Proposals should specify how they plan to collaborate with other proposals selected under this and other relevant topics , for example by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to cover these activities.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of supporting the assessment of the social, economic and environmental issues associated with the proposed innovative solution, including trade-offs, the impact on labour, safety culture, and risk management on farms.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-8, Using automatic species recognition and artificial intelligence to fight illegal fish discards and revolutionise fisheries control,4/12/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal objectives, both the farm to fork strategy and the common fisheries policy aim to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are ecologically, economically and socially sustainable and provide a source of healthy food for EU citizens. The successful proposals should unequivocally contribute to phase out the practice of discarding unwanted fish and improving catch-reporting data by using automatic species recognition and artificial intelligence to analyse data sources, such as video footage, rapid DNA-based assays and sensor data in real-time through, for example, internet of things or similar monitoring systems.
To ensure that fisheries are ecologically, economically and socially sustainable and provide a source of healthy food, the EU needs to close the possible loopholes in the legislations that could potentially allow for illegal and unsustainable fishing practices. To be successful, the EU needs to have in place a technologically advanced and effective fisheries monitoring and control system and the digitisation of fisheries is a key element (notably through the use of techniques such as artificial intelligence, sensors and robotics). This objective will also contribute to the headline ambition ?A Europe fit for the digital age?.
The selected project is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Effective methods, tools and systems for species automatic recognition, analysis of Remote Electronic Monitoring video footage, rapid DNA-based assays and sensor data in real-time, and enhanced integration of results into the reporting systems used by fishers to report catches to competent authorities;
?	Enhanced capability to monitor and control illegal discarding practices at sea and increased ability by EU Member States to fully implement the Landing Obligation;
?	Implementation of ad-hoc sensors for the detection of discards and take advantage of the data from the Copernicus network, namely from its Maritime Surveillance Service;
?	Optimal fishing operations and fishing processing and enhanced EU ability to collect, exchange and analyse data;
?	Improved monitoring capabilities, including processing activities on board fishing vessels, and ultimately support to a sustainable management of marine biological resources.
Scope: Proposals should develop innovative and cost-effective solutions for automatic species recognition and quantification and assessment of health status of species (e.g., presence of parasites), and automatically analyse Remote Electronic Monitoring video footage, rapid DNA-based assays and sensor data in real-time. They should also develop mechanisms to ensure that the data collected by the cameras and sensors to be automatically analysed cannot be tampered with and that the system can automatically identify cases of system malfunction or missing information. Additionally, proposals should test the suggested solutions in real conditions, including the development of at least three pilot cases in three different European seas. They should also analyse vulnerabilities, dependencies and critical infrastructure in expanding the use of the solutions to Europe and worldwide (e.g., Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements).
Moreover, proposals should investigate possibilities for the integration of the results of the artificial intelligence analyses for the purposes of automated catch recording and reporting recommend effective designs of remote monitoring systems to cover processing activities on board of fishing vessels, and explore the possibilities of the system to contribute to the identification of parasites in processed fish (e.g. via DNA-based assays). They should also recommend standardised remote electronic monitoring formats for the exchange of the information between different control authorities or to be used for scientific purposes, including standards based on FLUX that could be potentially proposed for recognition by UN/CEFACT.
Also importantly, proposals should analyse how fisheries data, containing private information, can be shared in an anonymized and safe way complying with EU data protection rules (General Data Protection Regulation).
Finally, they should explore and recommend strategies to overcome possible resistance, by all stakeholders/parties, to the implementation of the innovative solutions and propose different ways for effective implementation.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-9," European partnership on sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate",4/12/2023,COFUND,12/22/2022,,,Around 45.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Food systems are among the central leverage points for the transition; they are inextricably linked with the well-being of people and planet. This is reflected in the farm to fork and EU biodiversity strategies, which are at the heart of the European Green Deal. They identify ambitious targets and objectives for redesigning parts of the food system, outline actions, and pledge to monitor the progress towards them. The UN Global Food Systems Summit 2021 has addressed these issues globally. A successful proposal will contribute to the European Green Deal priorities, especially to the farm to fork strategy, and will deliver co-benefits on each of the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities. The Partnership will also contribute to the common agricultural policy / common fisheries policy, circular economy action plan / blue economy, sustainable aquaculture, single market for green products, Europe?s digital decade, 2030 climate target plan, Waste Framework Directive, bioeconomy strategy and action plan, and the EU zero pollution action plan.
The Partnership will coordinate, align, and leverage European and national R&I efforts to future-proof food systems for co-benefits through an integrated and transdisciplinary systems approach. The Partnership will provide the scientific evidence, as well as the collaborative experience among practitioners and citizens, to support the transformation of local, national, European and global food systems.
The partnership is intended to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Accelerated transformation of local, national, European and global food systems, making them safe, sustainable, within planetary boundaries, healthy, fair and trusted ? for everyone;
?	Sustained multi-stakeholder EU partnership for R&I on food systems transformation with global-to-local linkages and a core strategy on food systems;
?	Enabled EU-wide committed food innovation policy and a strong foundation for a European Research Area for food systems;
?	Enhanced changes in the way we eat: safe, healthy and sustainable food are standard for all in the diverse food environment, via dietary shifts; changes in the way we process and supply  food: supply-side and process innovation towards carbon neutrality, product diversity and circularity, changes in the way we connect with food systems: Citizen engagement and consumer trust in reoriented food systems; and changes in the way we govern food systems: Leverage points for local, national, EU and global transition pathways ? incentives, boundary settings and co-creation.
Scope: The future health of Europe?s people and the planet lies on our plate. The way in which food is produced on land, in fresh water and in oceans, as well as in aquaculture systems, fished, processed, packaged, distributed, valued, prepared, consumed, wasted and recycled should change to ensure that environmental, social and economic sustainability of food become core assets of EU?s food systems, along with food safety and food security. Research and Innovation (R&I) is a critical resource for the EU in the transformation towards Sustainable Food Systems  for People, Planet & Climate (SFS). The prime condition for success is that a wide diversity of actors join forces in a Partnership ? with a mission for change and willingness to contribute to joint actions.
There is consensus about the need for transformation of the current types of production, processing, distribution, and consumption in linear food chains towards circular food systems functioning within planetary boundaries. The sustainable food systems will provide food that is safe, sustainable healthy, fair and trusted for/by everyone. This transition needs an overarching food systems approach to address several challenges in an integrative manner and empowering all relevant stakeholders, diverse voices and geographical regions. This partnership does not address primary production as growing food, agricultural production and other specific aspects related to it, will be covered in the Horizon Europe Partnerships on Agroecology and Animal Health and Welfare.
This Partnership will provide a food systems R&I platform connecting local, national and European platforms, R&I programs and combining in-cash and in-kind resources in support of the transition to sustainable European food systems by 2030.
The European Partnership under Horizon Europe Sustainable Food Systems for People, Planet & Climate should be implemented through a joint programme of activities. These should target high impact, relevance for stakeholders and capacity building, ranging from research, innovation to coordination and networking activities, including training, dialogue, communication and dissemination activities in all research and innovation projects of the Partnership. Emphasis should be given to demonstration, upscaling and experimentation calls that strengthen collective intelligence and effect meaningful transformations through informing all of the stakeholders on the best science, data and insights from across the food systems:
The Partnership should aim to achieve the following objectives:
?	Develop work programmes as implementation steps of the high-level Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) defining key activities;
?	Pool R&I resources by joint calls for R&I projects based on commonly developed Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) and a Roadmap;
?	Establish a Food systems knowledge Hub of hubs with a central Hub (or Platform) for understanding when food systems are evolving sustainably (in what contexts, with which actors, etc.), and a network of transformative research and innovation labs (FS-labs or ?hubs?) for systemic innovations at different scales;
?	Provide place-based solutions in the FS Labs, exploring them as living labs to test sustainable food systems pathways, like policy and city labs, experimental restaurant environments, etc.;
?	Provide the frame for developing system approaches with sustainable outcomes in the Hub of hubs;
?	Enable knowledge sharing, and scaling - adapting knowledge systems, innovation platforms and science-policy interfaces for ensuring impact; while making use of data and technology where it adds value. The science based collective intelligence will effect meaningful transformation. Proposals are encouraged to cooperate with actors such as the European Commission?s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The JRC may provide expertise on how to strengthen the relationship between scientists and European policy makers and to promote research and collaboration on food systems science.
When it comes to food systems, it is important to recognize that all food producers, including aquaculture and fisheries, as well as retailers and processors have a key role as intermediaries between production and consumption. Alignment of private and public goals is a condition for success of public strategies. In particular, innovative food businesses implementing the European Green Deal, farm to fork and bioeconomy objectives could play a lighthouse role. Stakeholders from the quadruple helix  (i.e. policymakers, businesses/industry, researchers, and civil society), from different sectors of the food system, should be brought together on this overarching platform, with the aim of strengthening science-policy-society interfaces and increase transformative potential.
Partners are expected to provide financial and/or in-kind contributions for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination. The partnership is expected to mobilise EU, national and regional capacities to leverage investments, including from the private sector and foundations, increase up-scalability and market accessibility for the developed solutions and thus increase the return to investments.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The Partnership is part of a ?partnership landscape? that needs to avoid overlaps and build synergies for win-win collaboration and solutions, in particular with the Partnerships Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures, Agriculture of Data and Animal Health and Welfare. Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The Partnership should allocate resources to cooperate with existing projects, initiatives, platforms, science-policy interfaces, institutional processes at EU level, and at other levels where relevant to the partnership?s goals. Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing coordinated calls for transnational proposals that provide grants to third parties.
This topic should involve contributions from the social sciences and humanities disciplines.
The expected duration of the partnership is seven to ten years.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-10, Eradicate micronutrient deficiencies in the EU,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 9.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food systems, and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to eradicate micronutrient deficiencies in the EU and Associated Countries. It will contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, dietary shift, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
The main objective of this topic is to contribute to the eradication of micronutrient deficiencies and reduction of nutrition inequalities across EU and Associated Countries at different levels (e.g. countries, regions, urban/rural/coastal areas) and for different communities of vulnerable groups such as infants, elderly, pregnant women, people with food intolerances/allergies, people with metabolic disorders on the one hand, and migrants and low income groups on the other hand.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Improved knowledge of the true prevalence of human micronutrient deficiencies across EU and Associated Countries and development of proposals for optimal interventions to eradicate micronutrient deficiencies in different target groups;
?	Improved knowledge and understanding of micronutrient functionality and metabolism during food digestion at different critical periods of life;
?	Reduction of nutrition inequalities by providing solutions at a general population level across EU and Associated Countries;
?	Eradication of micronutrient deficiencies by providing solutions particularly for the vulnerable population groups in shifting towards healthier diet;
?	Better understanding of the health costs resulting from micronutrient deficiency.
Scope: Globally, more than 820 million people have insufficient food intake and many more consume low quality diets that cause 2 billion of people with micronutrient deficiencies and 2 billion of people overweight or obese. Micronutrient deficiencies have a direct impact on individuals and on societies, resulting in poorer health, lower educational attainment and decreased capacity to work and earning potential. The elderly, pregnant woman, children, people with chronic disease and poorer population groups or people socially isolated are particularly at risk. Even if modern food distribution has largely eliminated seasonal gaps in fruits and vegetables, only a limited number of edible crops (2 %) are currently used for the human diet. Therefore, it is still possible that individual diets are not varied enough to ensure adequate dietary quality and prevent micronutrient deficiencies. Climate change and increased atmospheric CO2 can directly alter (micro) nutrient content of crops and livestock products. Processing also alters the nutrient composition of foods (e.g. by removal of the part of the grain that contain beneficial nutrients such as fibre, protein and micronutrients) and, potentially, nutrient bioavailability (e.g. change of structure with treatment with high pressure/temperature). In Europe, studies suggest substantial variability in micronutrient intakes such as vitamins D and E, iron, iodine, magnesium, potassium, selenium and zinc according to sex and among different population groups and countries.
Micronutrient deficiencies are preventable and the choice of interventions should be based on the root cause, the scope and severity of the micronutrient deficiencies. Proposals for interventions/solutions need to be coherent with national/Associated Countries and EU food and health laws and policies. Where relevant, activities should build on and expand the results of past and ongoing research projects and collaborate with relevant initiatives.
Standardized methods should be used for collecting missing data and/or for updating them using existing data/studies/cohorts to generate better quality data on population micronutrient statuses to plan and target proposals for policy makers to develop intervention programs and propose them mechanisms to monitor their progress.
Proposals are expected to address all of the following R&I activities:
?	Develop specific micronutrient biomarkers to facilitate screening of high-risk populations/individuals and to identify the optimal intervention.
?	Map and monitor the specific vulnerable groups suffering from micronutrient deficiencies at national/regional/rural/urban/coastal levels for different gender, age, socio-economic and cultural groups in EU and Associated Countries to determine the root cause and the true prevalence of the micronutrient deficiencies, identify their specific needs for optimal health/development.
?	Explore the determinants and barriers of micronutrient deficiencies in different geographical zones. Utilize big data and artificial intelligence to elucidate the complex links between micronutrients, diets, health and development of diseases.
?	Further study the functionality, bioavailability, risk/benefits of the micronutrients during critical periods of life. Understand the specific mechanism of food digestion (e.g. the effect of the matrix, role of the gut microbiome, interaction with other ingredients/nutrients) to enable to advise for optimal combinations of foods to maximise bioavailability, or to incorporate, where appropriate, micronutrients in food products in order to be taken efficiently.
?	For the vulnerable groups, develop innovative solutions/strategies/programme, through an integrated food-based approach instead of food supplementation and fortification (e.g. fresh and diversified food naturally rich in (micro)nutrients of concern which are under-consumed including old/neglected fruit and vegetable crops) for different geographical zones and for different communities and evaluate their effective impact on micronutrients deficiencies.
?	Develop innovative and effective tools to improve education, communication and training on healthy nutrition and diets in order to avoid micronutrient deficiencies which are adapted to various socio-economic groups of the populations in respect of cultures, ages, gender, needs at different level (e.g. public authorities, health care providers, education systems). These tools should be available to policy makers, responsible national authorities to support their efforts for health promotion, disease prevention and care.
?	Provide recommendations, guidelines and cases studies underpinned by scientific evidence that are coherent with relevant national and EU food law and policy and that could be used by policy makers to design coherent, safe and sustainable micronutrient deficiency programmes. Provide evidence in the form of a cost/benefit analysis of the proposed measures and the costs of not acting.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of academia, research-technology organizations, food businesses and other relevant actors of the value chain and take into account sex and gender analysis. Relevant advice of European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has to be taken into account",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-11," New detection methods on products derived from new genomic techniques for traceability, transparency and innovation in the food system",4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal will be in line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as with the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050. The farm to fork strategy aims to accelerate the transition to sustainable farming and food systems. It recognises the role that new innovative techniques may play in increasing sustainability, provided they are safe for consumers and the environment while bringing benefits for society as a whole. In addition, one of the strategy?s main priorities is to ensure traceability and authenticity, and to enhance transparency. In this context, the successful proposals should contribute to ensuring traceability and authenticity, enhancing transparency and promoting innovation in the area of new genomic techniques.
Although existing detection methods may be able to detect even small alterations in the genome, this is sometimes not sufficient to confirm the presence of a genetically modified organism/product (GMO) regulated under Directive 2001/18/CE or Regulation 1829/2003, as the same alteration(s) could have been obtained by conventional breeding, which is not subject to the GMO legislation.
The existing approaches for the detection of GMOs cannot be applied in all cases. Various products obtained with new genomic techniques, as defined by European Commission, Joint Research Centre 2021 , do not contain targets (e.g., promoters/terminators for screening purposes or event-specific sequences) on which GMO detection is largely based.
The challenge to identify certain genetically modified products is not always related to the available methodologies, but rather to the difficulty to differentiate against non-regulated products.
Some of the above mentioned challenges have been identified by recent literature  and the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL) report of 26 March 2019 (JRC116289) which, referring to gene editing derived plant products, concluded that validation of an event-specific detection method and its implementation for market control will be feasible only for products carrying a known DNA alteration that has been shown to be unique.(i.e. the alteration should be specific for the gene edited organism/product). The same consideration might apply for cisgenesis applications combined with gene editing. Under the current circumstances, market control will fail to detect unknown genome-edited plant products. The report notes that several issues regarding the detection, identification and quantification of genome-edited products will require further consideration, as its findings are currently based on theoretical assessments.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Reliable detection methods to address the challenges described;
?	Development and validation of detection tools for enforcement authorities as well as for developers and agri-food operators;
?	Empower enforcement authorities, developers and agri-food operators for the authenticity and traceability of products obtained through new genomic techniques;
?	Enable informed consumer choices by enhancing transparency and traceability across the food chain;
?	Enable innovation in the food system linked to new genomic techniques.
Scope: Proposals are expected to contribute to the development and validation of detection methods of products obtained through new genomic techniques, including all of the following activities:
?	Examine innovative ways and/or specific markers that would allow for distinction between products resulting from new genomic techniques subject to the GMO legislation and products that are not subject to the GMO legislation. This should not only entail the detection of specific mutations, but also of other markers in the genome that are specific for the genotype containing the mutation/s. The methods should be able to distinguish between identical mutations obtained through different techniques;
?	Development and validation of reliable detection methods including when possible quantification. Such methods could focus on products with known mutations (i.e. DNA sequence known) or on products with unknown mutations;
?	The proposed detection methods should focus on a wide applicability of all or a subgroup of products, allowing for a screening approach. These methods should be assessed on pure products as well as on mixtures typical of food or feed products in the market. Proposals should always include plant-based products and may include also animal and/or microorganisms-based products.
?	The proposal could also focus on the detection of unintended mutations or insertions (foreign DNA, CRISPR-Cas sequences, etc);
?	The proposals could also include digital/virtual/AI modelling aspects along with the detection methods alternatives;
?	The development and validation of standardized methodologies and the contribution to future standardisation processes is encouraged.
Proposals are encouraged to cooperate with actors such as the European Commission?s Joint Research Centre (JRC) Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality, which provides expertise in food science, authenticity and quality of food supplied in the EU. Proposals could also foresee the involvement of the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL).
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-5 by the end of the project. Proposals should define clearly the TRL starting point for each involved technology and the plan to reach more advanced TRL.
Applicants should seek synergies and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects (including projects under the same topic) in the areas of food and feed chain traceability and new genomic techniques. Therefore proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under e.g. the topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-08. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-12, Thematic network ensuring food safety by translating research and innovation into practice,4/12/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 2.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the farm to fork strategy the successful proposals will support food safety in the food system. Despite the continued generation of new knowledge and innovative solutions through funded European projects on how to ensure food safety in the food supply chain, they are often insufficiently exploited/known and widely applied by end-users for different reasons (official control authorities, food business operators, food safety risks assessors, etc.). Innovative ideas from practice are also insufficiently captured, exchanged and spread. Food safety knowledge and innovation ecosystems are insufficiently connected.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Widespread use of existing new knowledge and innovative solutions by end-users (practitioners) on the ground ensuring food safety;
?	Improved flow of knowledge and innovative solutions with end-users through more dynamic interactions and new collaboration methodologies to ensure food safety along the food supply chain;
?	Better incorporation of end-users needs into the activities of research and innovation ecosystems, which would generate a better targeted and shared research agenda for innovation-driven food safety research, including the multi-actor approach. Greater user acceptance and adoption of the collected solutions generated;
?	Improved skills and long-term availability of training and education material and on-line communities for end-users on how to ensure food safety
Scope: Proposals are expected to contribute to the creation of a thematic network in the area of food safety, including all of the following activities:
?	Development of a community of practice to foster knowledge exchange between end-users and research and innovation ecosystems who will work together. Traditional and local food products should be taken into consideration in this community of practice;
?	Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of academia and research-technology organizations, etc. with end-users (official control authorities, food businesses, industrial clusters, etc.) and other relevant actors of the food chain;
?	Compilation of a comprehensive description of the state of food and feed safety practices, procedures, systems and technologies (including not only technologies for food safety hazards detection but also preventative approaches as well as food equipment/systems hygienic design best practices, and existing big data and/or artificial intelligence tools applied to food safety). Proposals should focus on the cost/benefit aspects of the practices and innovations collected and build on existing and new available knowledge, data and models enabling the practical implementation of solutions;
?	Creation of tailor-made communication materials summarizing, sharing and presenting, in a language easily understandable for end-users, existing best practices and innovations that are close to implementation into practice, but not sufficiently known by end-users;
?	Identification and mapping of possible relations and synergies with other networks, projects, initiatives and policy and funding instruments at regional, national and European level, that could help disseminate and exploit knowledge and results showing the added value of these inter-connections as well as to put in place mechanisms ensuring the future sustainability of the community of practice. Dissemination via public events, publication of case studies, dissemination papers and reports, and the creation of an on-line collaborative space that remain active in the long-term including the availability of materials for training and education;
?	Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-07, HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-16 and HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-17.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-13, Cultured meat and cultured seafood ? state of play and future prospects in the EU,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food system, the biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to promote the production, provision and safe consumption of alternative sources of protein, and dietary shifts towards sustainable healthy nutrition, contributing to the transformation of food systems to deliver co?benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction, empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Cell-based agriculture, and especially cultured meat (also called in vitro meat, lab-grown meat, artificial meat, cellular meat or cell-based meat) and cultured seafood, could be considered as a promising and innovative solution to help achieving the objectives of the farm to fork strategy for fair, safe, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems. However, the potential environmental impact and impact on sustainability aspects need to be thoroughly assessed and safety established.
As such, the objective of this topic is to develop knowledge on the sustainability aspects relevant to this subject (i.e. environmental, economic, and social). It does not aim to help developing the market of cultured meat and cultured seafood in the EU.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Full understanding and up-to-date knowledge provided to food system actors on environmental, economic and social aspects of cultured meat and cultured seafood, including on ethics.
?	Additional knowledge provided on potential challenges of and opportunities offered by cultured meat and cultured seafood to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air, water and soil pollution, resource depletion and impact on ecosystems, generation of wastes, and on human health.
Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Scope: In 2020, cultured meat and cultured seafood knew a boost in interest outside Europe, with the first authorisation for marketing cultivated meat products in Singapore and a large increase in investment. In Europe, this sector is starting to attract investments as well (the EU invested through REACT-EU in lab-grown meat ). At present, cell-based food products are not marketed in the EU. Such products require a pre-market authorisation before they can be placed on the EU market and, depending on the techniques used, this authorisation may need to be via either the GMO legislation or the novel food regulation. Once an application for the authorisation of these products is submitted to the Commission, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will carry out the safety evaluation of these products, including whether they are nutritionally disadvantageous.
Few studies have been developed to understand the impact of the cultured meat cycle (production, consumption, waste) on the environment, and its link to social and cultural aspects. Rough estimates based on a life cycle assessment suggest lower GHG emissions, land requirements and water use compared to conventional meat. Conclusions on energy use depend on the methodology used and assumptions made. Cultured meat and cultured seafood also face social and cultural challenges.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
?	Study the social aspects related to cultured meat and cultured seafood (potential benefits and risks): including the consumers? perception on cultured meat and cultured seafood, animal welfare, religious and ethical aspects, health aspects (for example impacts on obesity or NCDs, nutrition aspects) beyond safety risks eventually assessed by EFSA, etc.
?	Study the economic aspects (potential benefits and risks): including how to reduce the high infrastructure costs and high-cost raw materials, as well as scaling up in a cost-effective way (including through reaching out to start-ups in this field to understand the difficulties and potential); and the ?cost of inaction? (economic impact of not having such investments in the EU and Associated Countries).
?	Study the environmental aspects (potential benefits and risks) considering the entire life cycle by using the Environmental Footprint methods, including elements on carbon footprint, pollution, impacts on biodiversity, resource use, and considerations on how the released land from livestock production could be utilised within the bioeconomy system, etc. and develop a comparison of the overall environmental impact of cultured meat/seafood vs. conventional meat/seafood. Particular attention should be given to the assessment of the energy intensiveness of cultured meat and cultured seafood production. Livestock co-products, such as leather, pet food, cosmetics, fertilisers, other chemicals, etc., should also be considered, as well as food waste and packaging issues.
?	Study technical problems relating to the production of cultured meat and cultured seafood and identify possible solutions that could improve the economic viability, circularity and overall sustainability.
?	Identify new sources of ingredients for the cultured meat and cultured seafood to increase the sustainability aspects of the products (including the nutritional value).
?	Identify, explore and study scenarios of market penetration and consumer acceptance of cultured meat and cultured seafood and conduct LCA analysis to assess the environmental and sustainability impact/benefits each scenario would result in (considering issues such as the availability of energy for different levels of uptake of this technology).
?	Explore the current and possible future impacts for the farmers (including aqua-farmers) and industry, including economic viability, challenges and opportunities for the farming sectors, etc.
?	Proposals should involve a multi-disciplinary consortium of independent researchers that should organize conferences and meetings gathering a wide range of food system actors. International cooperation is strongly encouraged. Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects (e.g., Meat4all, CCMeat). The proposals should also consider projects selected under HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-12 and HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-01-07. The project should have a clear plan as to how it will collaborate with any other relevant project funded under other relevant topics. They should participate in joint activities, workshops, focus groups or social labs, and common communication and dissemination activities, and show potential for upscaling. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-14, Providing marketing solutions to prevent and reduce the food waste related to marketing standards,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, and the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, and the Commission communication ?Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems?, the successful proposals will support R&I to prevent and reduce food losses and waste . They should therefore contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable food consumption, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Better understanding of the impact of food marketing standards on the generation of food waste along the supply chain , including the food waste generated between stages of the supply chain, and for various commodities.
?	Improved market access to foods that do not meet marketing standards but are still safe to eat.
?	Better understanding of the purpose and nature of private marketing standards and the underlying reasons for establishing such standards.
Contribution to the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities.
Scope: Food marketing standards are standards individuals and businesses comply with to be able to put food on the market or to sell to a particular buyer. These standards include or may include requirements about technical definitions, classification, presentation, marking and labelling, packaging, production method, conservation, storage, transport related administrative documents, certifications and time limits, restriction of use and disposal, ?
As these standards focus on quality, they are different from food safety standards (foods that do not comply with marketing standards can still be safe to eat).
The marketing standards applied to food marketed in the EU exist at different levels and in different forms:
?	International standards .
?	EU marketing standards, contained in the Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation, the CMO secondary legislation and the ?Breakfast Directives?.
?	National marketing standards set up by governments of Member States
?	Private marketing standards.
Proposals should address all the following points:
?	Provide estimates of the amounts of food waste resulting from the application of the above-mentioned marketing standards along the food supply chain. In particular, estimates of the amounts of food waste due to interactions between the stages and actors of the value chain should be provided. These estimates should be differentiated according to the responsible marketing standard(s).
?	Assess trade-offs between food waste prevention/reduction objectives and other objectives pursued by marketing standards (e.g. keeping food of unsatisfactory quality off the market, providing clarity and transparency on the market, facilitating the functioning of the internal market; responding to consumers? and society?s expectations).
?	Assess the underlying reasons for setting up private marketing standards, including aspects related to consumers expectations.
?	Identify solutions that would enable to improve the business potential for suboptimal foods not meeting market standards yet still safe to eat. This should include the identification of alternative marketing channels or models (including processing and other destinations), whilst ensuring the highest possible value for their valorisation and considering trade-offs between the different valorisation options. The most promising interventions and good practices already in place for similar foods or food categories should be considered.
?	Provide recommendations/solutions to food businesses, owners of marketing standards and regulators on how to prevent/reduce food waste due to marketing standards.
?	Some recommendations may help design marketing standards or support future policy development, in order to prevent and reduce food waste.
?	Implement the multi-actor approach (see eligibility conditions) by conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide range of food system actors.
The proposal activities should be performed at least for fruits and vegetables. Applicants may choose to cover additional commodities from the following food types: cereals, fish, meat, dairy and eggs.
The proposal activities should be performed across several Member States, in different parts of the EU.
Proposals should build on past or ongoing research projects and ensure synergy with relevant initiatives, including the Commission?s EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste  and the evaluations already carried out by the European Commission in view of the revision of EU marketing standards and date marking rules. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and any other relevant topic, e.g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, etc. Selected proposals under this topic will thus need to work together and adapt their initial work plan. Communication and dissemination activities should also be grouped and coordinated in a complementary manner.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-15, Fostering resilient European food systems in a changing world,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 8.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the recent communication on ?Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems?  and the farm to fork strategy, the successful proposal will support the implementation of the communication ?Contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security in times of crisis?,  thereby enhancing the resilience of European Union food systems in a changing world, as well as taking into account developments on the farm to fork strategy?s proposal for a legislative framework for sustainable food systems.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better understanding of the short- and long-term drivers of change that may affect food systems at different levels (global, national, regional, urban/rural areas level) and put food security at risk.
?	Better understanding of the vulnerabilities, dependencies and critical infrastructures of the food systems in the EU and worldwide, where this may have implications for the EU and Associated Countries.
?	Improved preparedness to deal with risks that may threaten the nutritionally appropriate EU and Associated Countries? food supply and food security by making use of available data and platforms (including on weather, climate, biodiversity, socio-economic and markets data).
?	Enhanced resilience of nutritionally appropriate food supply and improved food security in the EU and Associated Countries, in a changing world.
?	Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Scope: Food is necessary to sustain life. Ensuring food supply is an objective set out in Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The food systems in the European Union have been reliable and supplied more food than demanded. They proved to be resilient to large-scale disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the surge in global commodity prices, further accelerated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, highlights again the need for EU agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and food supply chains to become more resilient and sustainable. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, which is already experiencing unprecedented environmental and climate changes, and in which the state of global geopolitical tensions is high, sustaining the ability of food systems to provide enough food for all that is as nutritious and meets dietary needs is likely to be a substantial challenge for Europe in the future.
Understanding what drives our food system, both externally and internally, on a short-term basis and in the long-term, and how we can measure or monitor the drivers of change and their impacts on the food supply and food security is vital if we want to give policymakers and businesses better tools for making food systems more sustainable and more resilient to diverse shocks and stresses (such as pandemics, geopolitical disruptions, conflicts and economic sanctions, extreme climatic conditions, environmental changes, natural disasters or energy price increase). The project should not only point to some serious vulnerabilities, (inter)dependencies and critical infrastructure of the food systems, but also offer indications for policymakers and businesses about where to direct efforts and investments to improve resilience.
Proposed activities should cover all of the following aspects:
?	Analyse vulnerabilities, (inter)dependencies and critical infrastructure of the EU and Associated Countries? food systems in the global context.
?	Establish an observatory for the main socio-economic, political, health, technological and environmental drivers of change, including short-term shocks and long-term stresses, to which the food systems were/are/might be exposed and develop an early warning system. For long-term developments, use of foresight is encouraged.

Regional integration, including through greater trade in goods and services, is one of the key aspirations of the African Union?s (AU) Agenda 2063. The launch of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has the potential to significantly accelerate growth and sustainable development, doubling intra-African trade and food trade in particular. While strong local food systems are a backbone of food security, trade contributes to resilient food systems by balancing between markets. The promotion of trade needs to take a start from the local, national and regional level to integrate food safety practices into all aspects of food production, distribution, marketing and consumption. Food safety is a pre-condition for food trade. It aligns with the recent AU decision to establish the Africa Food Safety Agency to ensure the coordination of food safety at the continental level

HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-1, Agro-pastoral/outdoor livestock systems and wildlife management,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the farm to fork strategy for a transition to fair, healthy and environmentally friendly livestock production systems, and of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, including the conservation status of certain habitats and species, the successful proposal will help policy makers and other actors to monitor and improve the management of farming and terrestrial wildlife relationships, thus contributing to sustainable agriculture and ecosystem services.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Innovative and sustainable practices and tools at landscape level to prevent and control negative consequences of interactions between livestock and wild animals to protect wildlife and pastoral/outdoor production systems
?	Recommendations/policy advice on optimal management at EU level of wildlife and agro-pastoral systems
?	Decision-making process on wildlife management and land planning participated by relevant stakeholders
?	Improved coordination across Europe in terms of wildlife management, surveillance and data collection systems
Scope: Agro-pastoral/outdoor livestock farming systems, which include a large number traditional activities in Europe such as grazing systems, mountain livestock farming, transhumance, silvo-pastoral and agroforestry systems, offer beneficial effects not only to animal production, e.g., in case of scarce fodder resources, or to animal welfare, but also to habitat maintenance, carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation and soil protection.
The increased demand for natural resources by human population with the consequent fragmentation of wildlife habitat, together with the increased population of wild animals and the change in land use have often resulted in human-wildlife conflicts. The interactions between livestock farmers and wildlife are more frequent and cause damages to both sides with conflicts in the management of farming systems and natural resources.
Wildlife population, which is worth protecting, occupies wide geographic area and extend across administrative borders, and public administrations face difficulties with regards to the reduction of the impact of wildlife on livestock farming. The implementation of a common and integrated approach at EU level is required to optimize the management of the co-existence of terrestrial wildlife (large carnivores, ungulates) and agro-pastoral/outdoor livestock systems at landscape level.
The following elements should be incorporated:
?	Review of current wildlife management approaches in agro-pastoral/outdoor production systems in the different EU Member States and Associated Countries and assessment of the effectiveness of different prevention measures
?	Map the most common types of damages caused and the positive externalities created by wild animals with respect to livestock and crops in Europe. Create an inventory of good practices and infrastructures at farms and regional levels, within a wider wildlife management approach.
?	Improve or develop tools/technologies for (real time) data collection and analysis to assess, monitor and control (wild) animal behaviour and damages
?	Cost/benefit analysis of current and new farming strategies that preserve, protect and valorise wildlife and pastoralism in different regions and ecosystems. Socio-economic, environmental, cultural and political aspects should be considered.
?	Assess stakeholders? (farmers, hunters, conservationists, general public, policy makers?) perspectives and needs (participatory approach) and improve or develop effective instruments to reduce conflicts between livestock farming and wildlife. Identify the most effective measures to mitigate damages and the most common (monetary, non-monetary) compensation mechanisms across Europe.
The proposal should take into account projects funded under the LIFE programme, and interact and engage a dialogue with relevant EU organizations such as EU Platform on Coexistence between People and Large Carnivores .
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach? and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in managing wildlife/livestock interaction (e.g., farmers, hunters, game farmers and producers, agricultural advisory services, land managers, ecology and nature conservation experts, animal behaviour scientists, social scientists and other relevant actors).
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-2, New healthy and sustainable food products and processes,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 6.00-3,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food system, and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to develop new food products and processes in conventional or organic production systems. These new products should be healthier and overall more sustainable and based on natural ingredients, tasty appealing to the consumer, affordable and minimally processed.

?	Alignment in goals of consumers and food solution providers with more healthy, tasty, minimally processed, affordable and sustainable food.
?	New market and job opportunities for sustainable food SMEs and industries.
Scope: Several studies in adults found a strong scientific concordance between consumption of ultra-processed foods and a higher risk of developing cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Evidence is accumulating from mechanistic studies of the plausible causal pathways by which the physical structure and chemical compositions of these foods might cause harm. Additives or cocktail of additives could play a role in the incidence of NCDs and further R&I are needed. It is now widely accepted that a diet rich in plant-based food, such as fruits, vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes and nuts, may reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and is also beneficial against obesity and metabolic diseases. Further research is necessary to determine how the structural characteristics of plant-based foods deliver health benefits in modulating digestibility and in improving bioavailability of nutrients and how the physical structure may be modified by processing.
An increasing number of people pay attention to environmental, health, social and ethical issues and they seek value in food more than ever before. Therefore, a food systems? transformation is needed with a shift towards more healthy, safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable food for all, coupled with a respective change in the food production, distribution and consumption involving all the actors of the food chain.
A move to a plant-based diet with less red and processed meat, less salt, sugars, saturated and trans fats and additives, with more whole-grain cereals, fruit and vegetables, legumes and nuts, as well as processing efficiency and reduced losses and wastage along the food supply chains is needed. Where relevant, activities should build on and expand the results of past and ongoing research projects and collaborate with relevant initiatives.

?	Develop and optimise new efficient methods/processes to reduce costs (e.g. energy, water, food raw materials) and impact on the environment to produce minimally processed functional food ingredients and food products and assess their nutritional, sensorial, structural and functional properties to enhance health and well-being, including the values provided by the plant/produce microbiome for nutritional qualities and its effects on the human gut microbiome.
?	Develop new healthy, sustainable, diversified, minimally processed, reformulated, tasty and affordable food products and assess their nutritional, structural, sensorial and functional properties to enhance health and well-being and to improve nutrition status.
?	Demonstrate the safety of the developed food products in accordance with relevant EU regulatory frameworks related to their placing on the market, and generate relevant data for pre-market authorisation,
?	Investigate, assess and develop improved predictive realistic models for quantifying effects on human health (risks/benefits) of processing and food ingredients (and/or mixture of them).
?	Study and optimise the role of the food matrix structure to make specific ingredients available or not (in case of caloric control) to our digestive system to reach the desired health effects/to combat non-communicable (NCDs).
?	Ensure societal acceptance and the consumer buy in of new food products and processes in involving consumer at all stage of the product development process.

This will contribute to the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities. The EU?s farm to fork strategy states that: ?European diets are not in line with national dietary recommendations, and the ?food environment?  does not ensure that the healthy option is always the easiest one?.
The overall aim of this topic and associated R&I activities is to enhance healthy and sustainable diets aligned with national dietary advice by empowerment of citizens and their capacity to eat and cook at home in line with budgetary and time constraints as well as their living situation. The activity will develop tools that can be considered by national competent authorities for implementation. Interventions should not target citizens directly, as full alignment with national policies and advice on nutrition and health needs to be ensured.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Empowered citizens supported by tools and applications to make healthy and sustainable food provision, cooking and eating, and treating of food at home the easiest choice;
?	Enhanced uptake of beneficial tools and applications by citizens, especially those who need it most, considering socio-economic characteristics and differences across EU and Associated countries.
Scope: Urban lifestyles have led to more consumption of ultra-processed and packaged food . Cooking skills may enhance healthy and sustainable diets, so supporting consumers provides potential . There are also indications, that social change might be enhanced by encouraging minorities to publicly challenge unsustainable norms during social interactions . This potential can be exploited to drive change in behaviour by citizen engagement.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
?	Develop tools and applications that enhance citizens to have a healthy and sustainable food provision, diet and treating of food at home/ or discourage unhealthy and unsustainable choices that can be considered by national policy makers and private actors;
?	Include in approaches ?culinary culture dimension? such as based on nationality, religion, culture, regionality and seasonality etc., and time and financial constraints;
?	Engage citizens in solutions to create inclusive and sustainable solutions for broad uptake;
?	Ensure that national nutritional policies and advice are respected as well as food safety;
?	Link solutions to the issue of food waste and to the need to reduce household wastes generally, notably plastics, as part of a circular economy to include all aspects of sustainability tools that can be considered by national policy makers for implementation;
?	Take a holistic approach, e.g., delivery (including prepared meals, micro deliveries, decentralised pick-up points) including transport and distribution aspects, short supply chains, marketing, sustainable packaging, recycling and reduction in food waste;
?	Develop a sample plan to make available to Member State and Associated Countries authorities for several countries on how to enhance uptake of beneficial tools and applications considering different socio-economic characteristics of citizens and national laws.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of among others health actors, such as nutritionists, doctors and nurses.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-15: ?Transition to healthy and sustainable dietary behavior?.

Data-driven solutions in food systems also benefit the European Open Data Directive to share public data  and envisioned data spaces  as well as provide a base of AI deployment as enablers of the European Green Deal objectives.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Better understanding of citizens? food consumption behaviour, the factors influencing choices and drivers that would facilitate changes in behaviour in an inclusive manner towards healthy and sustainable food consumption practices;
?	Contribution to positive changes in individual behaviour towards healthy and sustainable food consumption and sustainable food system transformation.
Scope: Currently, consumers are sceptical to share data, least to the government . As there is a need for more data-driven decision making, engaging citizens in research through the provision of data on their practices, choices and attitudes towards the food system provides potential for a more direct citizen engagement in transforming food systems. The approach allows to exchange ideas, solutions, and opinions to encourage Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in driving sustainable food system transformation.
Citizen?s science  is a fast-growing mode of research and innovation  that can allow for enhanced food system transformation driven by engagement, trust and transparency. It can leverage relevant private relevant data to take stock of current citizens? behaviour towards the food system, including aspects such as food consumption, marketing and food environment influence, health, mobility, regionality/locality, food-related waste generation and management, etc. by using collective intelligence.
Proposals are expected to address all the following:
?	Explore the potential of ?citizen?s science? in the food systems domain by engaging and empowering citizens in using and providing data and technology to ensure inclusive solutions to drive sustainable food system transformation by promoting sustainable food consumption, reducing food waste, and creating a resilient food system;
?	Identify the challenges and drivers encouraging citizens to share data to ensure inclusive food system transformation;
?	Develop and test tools by using data and technology to enhance uptake of healthy and sustainable diets and foster sustainable food system transformation;
?	Explore which data types are most useful to share (behavioural data, data from private providers, such as data gathered by relevant apps, stated data?etc.) and how to meaningfully harmonize data to use data for food system transformation by different actors, and which tools to best make use of, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) while analysing how consumer data can be shared in an anonymized and safe way complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules;
?	Make concrete efforts to ensure that the data produced in the context of this project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly in the context of real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide ?FAIR-by-design? data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation;

HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-7, Impact of the development of novel foods based on alternative sources of proteins,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 3.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment-friendly food system, and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will support R&I to promote the production, provision and safe consumption of alternative sources of protein, and dietary shifts towards sustainable healthy nutrition, contributing to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable healthy nutrition and safe food, food poverty reduction, empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Novel foods are foods that have not been consumed to a significant extent in the EU before 15 May 1997. They can be newly developed, innovative foods, foods produced using new technologies and production processes, as well as foods that are or have been traditionally eaten outside of the EU. Alternative sources of proteins (i.e. other than conventional sources of proteins such as meat and dairy or mainstreamed from classical crops) may be considered as novel foods. Novel Foods can only be authorised in the EU market if they do not pose any risk to human health, the food?s intended use does not mislead consumers and are not nutritionally disadvantageous.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better and complete information provided about the impact this specific innovation, i.e. the development of novel food (e.g., insect protein, micro and macro algae-based products, microbial proteins, food/aquaculture by-products) would have especially for the food system in terms of sustainability (particularly economic and social aspects).
?	Solutions that can help achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal, especially the farm to fork strategy, and Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, zero pollution, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Scope:
?	Assess the potential of insect protein, micro and macro algae-based products, microbial proteins and/or food/aquaculture by-products in terms of market development taking into account the farm to fork strategy objectives based on up-to-date/new knowledge about them.
?	Assess their economic impact (e.g., price, production cost, share of market, etc.) and assess the impact such development will have on other sectors, across the food and the bio-based systems.
?	Assess their social impact (e.g., health aspects, consumer acceptance including considering gender and age aspects, cultural aspects).
?	Assess their potential (as well as related risks and trade-offs) to address the most relevant European Green Deal objectives, including environmental ones, compared to conventional sources of proteins (e.g. meat and dairy), and the need to shift to sustainable and healthy diets.
?	Implement the multi-actor approach by involving a wide range of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research.
?	International cooperation is strongly encouraged.
?	Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing research projects (especially related to environmental aspects developed by the projects funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-12 and HORIZON-CL6-2022-FARM2FORK-01-07, and projects funded under other relevant topics in this Work Programme). Projects should have a clear plan as to how they will collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (if funding of more than one project is possible) and any other relevant topic. They should participate in joint activities, workshops, focus groups or social labs, and common communication and dissemination activities, and show potential for upscaling. Applicants should plan the necessary budget to cover these activities.",

They should therefore contribute to the transformation of food systems to deliver co-benefits for climate (mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity, environmental sustainability and circularity, sustainable food consumption, food poverty reduction and empowerment of communities, and thriving businesses.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Reliable data on the environmental impacts related to food waste, in particular GHG emissions;
?	Better understanding of the food waste prevention efforts that will accelerate EU?s progress to reach climate targets and will help reduce environmental impacts (including on biodiversity) across the food supply chain;
?	Integration of actions related to food waste prevention/reduction into emission reduction instruments, national energy and climate plans and other relevant EU initiatives;
?	Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and to the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities.
Scope: Climate change and environmental degradation are recognised as the main challenges to tackle in the European Green Deal. Food waste prevention and reduction could contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution reduction, better air quality, biodiversity preservation...
The 2030 climate target plan sets out to raise the EU?s ambition on reducing greenhouse gas emissions to at least 55% below 1990 levels by 2030.
Member States have prepared integrated national energy and climate plans (NECPs) to achieve their 2030 targets.
The Commission brought support and expertise to Member States in the elaboration of their NECP and will continue to do so by supporting the full implementation of the plans, and prepare their update due in 2023 .
Key policies within the framework of the European Green Deal also include the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy, and the EU zero pollution action plan.
Proposals should address all the following points:
?	Provide reliable quantitative data for several Member States/Associated Countries on the environmental footprint of food waste, based on Life Cycle Assessments, and more specifically the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method developed by the European Commission.
?	A specific focus on the following Environmental Footprint (EF) impact categories identified in the PEF method is required:
o	Climate change (main focus)
o	Land use
o	Water use
o	Resource use
o	Other relevant categories that could help assess the impacts on biodiversity.
?	Combined data for the entire food supply chain but also data for each stage of the food supply chain  are expected, including a focus on sorting, storage, logistics and waste treatment. A detailed analysis for relevant food products is also expected.
?	Concerning the climate change category in particular, provide estimates on the life cycle GHG emissions due to food waste. Potential double counting of avoided emissions should be analysed. If possible, these data would have to be compared to GHG reductions assumed by Member States in the NECPs ? in order to enable measuring of potential impact from food waste prevention measures towards reaching the objectives of NECPs.
?	Elaborate different pathways of food waste prevention/reduction interventions and assess their potential for climate change adaptation/mitigation, reduction of pollution and preservation of biodiversity. The analysis should be carried out for several types of stakeholders.
?	Assess the potential for rebound effects due to food waste reduction .
?	Carry out mapping activities of relevant emission reduction and funding instruments and other EU initiatives in which food waste prevention/reduction could be well integrated.
?	Establish a set of recommendations on how to integrate food waste prevention/reduction in those instruments and initiatives (including NECPs).
?	Implement the multi-actor approach (see eligibility conditions) by conducting inter- and trans-disciplinary research and involving a wide range of food system actors (including possibly food start-ups).
Proposals should also build on past or ongoing research projects and ensure synergy with relevant initiatives. In particular, they should build on the work done by the Commission?s Joint Research Centre in support of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food Waste  and be aligned with the Environmental Footprint method developed by the Commission. The possible participation of the JRC in the project would consist of gathering data collected in the projects into a consistent framework for modelling food waste. It will also ensure that the proposed approach will be compatible with existing databases for the assessment of environmental impacts and aligned with the Environmental Footprint method, helping translating results into policy relevant outputs.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and any other relevant topic, e.g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, etc. Selected proposals under this topic will thus need to work together and adapt their initial work plan. Communication and dissemination activities should also be grouped and coordinated in a complementary manner.

Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved availability of qualitative and quantitative data pertaining to the contribution of agroforestry to climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity preservation, and to sustainable agriculture;
?	Improved management of agroforestry systems (conventional, agroecological and/or organic), including agro-pastoral systems, in Africa;
?	Enhanced capacities to evaluate the socioeconomic and environmental performance of agroforestry for climate change resilience;
?	A strengthened agroforestry innovation ecosystem for better user acceptance and implementation of agroforestry in the African Union (AU).
Scope: Achieving sustainable agricultural production that fosters both climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity preservation and enhancement is a policy objective that implies finding a balance with farm productivity, socio-economic viability and wider sustainability goals. Agroforestry systems include both traditional and modern land-use systems where trees are managed together with crops and/or animal production systems in agricultural settings. These systems have the potential to increase ecosystem services ? including soil carbon sequestration, water retention, erosion control, soil nutrients, pollination, pest- and disease-control ? and biodiversity, while improving farming productivity, profitability and sustainability of farmers? incomes. Implementation of agroforestry in the EU and the AU needs to be boosted in order to maximise this potential. The management of agroforestry systems is critical for their positive impact on climate and the environment as well as to ensure a balance with productivity and profitability for farmers. This is essential to promote the uptake and long-term sustainability of agroforestry.
Proposals should address the following:
?	Identification of the most suitable plant and animal species and breeds to be used in agroforestry for different geographic regions in Africa, generating sustainable ecosystems with positive impact on local communities, and on women, looking for models where this impact is greater. In vegetation management systems preference should be given to local species, to avoid potential unintended consequences linked to the introduction of alien species;
?	Assessment of local multi-purpose agroforestry species and breeds with benefits for food, pharmaceutical uses as well as ecosystem functions for the soil, biodiversity and their functions in a vegetation mosaic;
?	Assessment of specific agroforestry management measures aiming at preserving/enhancing biodiversity;
?	Assessment of the potential of carbon farming  as a possible future business for farmers and foresters, and analysis of its potential to contribute to reaching climate-neutrality in a few decades;
?	Identification of the structural needs of agroforestry crops and animals in different geographical regions in Africa, including the analysis of production burdens, suggesting solutions and addressing traceability of all steps in the production chain to measure the effectiveness of solutions;
?	Supporting this new value chain with knowledge and capacity building to be efficient, fair, and easily adopted, or not abandoned, by landowners and farmers;
?	Establishing local agroforestry pilot plots.
Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a wide range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors, such as research, farmers/foresters, advisory services, are brought together.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-11," EU-African Union ? towards climate-neutral, social just fair trade food systems",2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 4.50-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food system, and in support of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, the successful proposal will contribute to the AU-EU High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on Science, Technology and Innovation, and its first priority on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture.
The farm to fork strategy aims to accelerate the transition to a sustainable food system that should have a neutral or positive environmental impact, help to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. New opportunities in EU-African trade are opening-up for trade regimes with co-benefits for producers, climate and citizens. Innovative Information and Communications Technology (ICT) based, traceability and certification schemes should maximise co-benefits while helping to keep the effects of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) in particular administrative and transaction costs low.
The African countries signed the African Continental Free Trade Agreement and launched an action plan for Boosting Intra-African Trade with a view to strengthening regional integration. It is also one of the key priorities of the Africa Agenda 2063 and a major step towards African continental economic integration.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved assessment systems for sustainable food trade regimes with co-benefits for producers, climate and citizens, biodiversity, assessment of certification schemes (organic, carbon neutral, de-forestation free, conventional), testing innovative solutions with food systems/certification actors;
?	Provide data and recommendations for improved Non-Tariff Measure (NTM) regimes;
?	Provide solutions to food trade, Ministries in charge, border regime management (digital solutions).
Scope: Proposals are expected to address the following:
?	Study the tipping points to scale-up climate-neutral, fair and just food supply;
?	Explore the climate, biodiversity and social impacts of food supply (organic and conventional) and linked products due to land-use change;
?	Better understanding of the aim, collection, quantification and modelling of NTMs relevant for intra-African and EU-AU trade relations;

HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-1-two-stage, Increasing the availability and use of non-contentious inputs in organic farming,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal should support the objective of the farm to fork strategy to transition to fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption, notably the objective to promote and increase organic farming in Europe, in line with the target of at least 25% of the EU?s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030. Activities will support the implementation of concrete actions in the EU action plan for the development of organic production  and of Regulation (EU) 2018/848 on the rules on organic production and labelling of organic products . Activities will also support the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies? objective to reduce the risk and use of chemical pesticides by 50% and the use of more hazardous pesticides by 50%.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased availability, accessibility and adoption by farmers of cost-efficient alternatives to contentious inputs used in organic farming;
?	Fair, reliable and implementable rules on the use of inputs in organic farming;
?	Significantly reduced environmental impact of practices and input use in organic farming systems and enhanced organic crop and livestock production;
?	Provision of scientific support and recommendations for the development, implementation and evaluation of EU policies and strategies relevant for organic production, in particular on the reduction of contentious inputs as well as on the increased use of alternative products, strategies and solutions;
?	Increased networking and knowledge exchange among all relevant actors for organic farming, contributing to a strengthened research and innovation ecosystem on organic farming in Europe that also supports the spreading of research outcomes to farmers involved in low-input farming and/or agroecological production.
Scope: Promoting the use of more sustainable farming practices is a policy objective enshrined in the European Green Deal and its related strategies. Boosting organic farming, one of the objectives of the farm to fork and of the EU biodiversity strategies, can greatly contribute to achieving this ambition, and thereby also contributing to climate ambition as, as organic farming contributes directly and significantly to carbon storage in soils and biomass. Moreover, the Commission communication ?Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems?  highlights the role that organic farming can play in reducing the EU?s dependence on external inputs, since organic farming is recognised, among others, for the limitation in the use of off-farms inputs.
The organic legislation authorises the use of a specific set of products with a lower impact on the environment and on the soil. However, some of these substances have a harmful effect on terrestrial and aquatic species, which calls for the need to replace these substances either by lower impact products or methods or by resistant varieties. It is important to continue exploring ways to phase out and replace contentious inputs used in organic farming, and to increase the availability, accessibility and use of alternatives to these products. In doing so, due attention should be given to system approaches that consider the entire farm system, and its relation with the territorial and landscape levels. Moreover, in order to address farmers? needs in this specific area, socially innovative solutions are required.
Proposals should develop scientifically robust and transparent methodologies, building on achievements from previous research activities, notably those funded under the Horizon 2020 call ?SFS-08-2017 - Organic inputs ? contentious inputs in organic farming? (projects Organic-PLUS and RELACS).
Proposals should address all the following activities:
?	Develop, test and put in the place alternative products and solutions, including to the use of copper fungicides, mineral oils, external nutrient inputs (e.g. manure from conventional agriculture, recycled nutrients) in organic plant production, and to the responsible use of anthelmintics, antibiotics and synthetic vitamins used in organic livestock production.
?	Among the alternatives, consider those containing biologically active substances (microorganisms and other naturally occurring substances), invertebrate biological control agents, (micro)biological agents for soil amelioration or cultivation techniques, and considering effective functional biodiversity systems.
?	Building on existing demonstration sites and experiments where available and relevant, test the alternatives and, if relevant, their combinations.
?	Further develop toolboxes, strategies and technologies for the minimisation or phasing-out of the use of contentious inputs in organic farming.
?	Demonstrate the safety of the alternatives, in line with the EU regulatory framework related to their placing on the market, and generate data to enable the registration of the alternatives.
?	Deepen analysis and produce data on the efficacy, resource efficiency, climate and environmental impacts of the alternatives developed, compared to the contentious inputs they are to replace. This should include analysis of impact on non-target species and on human health.
?	Analyse farmers? and consumers? acceptance of the alternatives developed and consider new governance models/relations among food chain actors. This should include the development of business plans, with the support of Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS), and assessment of stakeholders? (farmers, policymakers, researchers, advisors, companies, consumers, etc.) perspectives and needs to improve already existing policy instruments to reduce the use of contentious inputs and increased availability of alternatives.
?	Set up demonstration sites that are representative of the diversity of organic farming systems in Europe, to promote participatory activities, and the exchange of knowledge and best practices among farmers.
?	Develop training packages targeted to farmers and other actors of the organic agri-food chain, and awareness raising activities towards citizens and consumers, engaging with existing initiatives where relevant.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach? and ensure adequate involvement of the main stakeholders involved in finding alternatives to the use of contentious inputs used in organic farming (farmers, breeders, researchers, advisors, industry, etc.). Proposals should cover contentious inputs used in a range of organically-grown crops (in- and out-door), both arable and perennial, as well as the organic livestock sector. Sectors with high economic relevance in different pedo-climatic conditions and various biogeographical regions should be targeted in a representative way. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, and ensure coherence and synergy with other relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, including under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE: ?Developing an EU advisory network on organic agriculture?, HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE: ?Organic farming thematic network to compile and share knowledge ready for practice? and the future partnership ?Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures?.
To ensure trustworthiness, swift and wide adoption by user communities, and to support EU and national policymakers, actions should adopt high standards of transparency and openness, going beyond ex-post documentation of results and extending to aspects such as assumptions, benchmarks, models and data quality during the life of projects.
Concrete efforts shall be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable), particularly in the context of real-time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide ?FAIR-by-design? data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-2-two-stage, Sustainable organic food innovation labs:  reinforcing the entire value chain,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 5.50-2,"Expected Outcome: By producing high quality food with low environmental impact, organic farming plays an essential role in developing sustainable food systems in the EU, an objective that is at the heart of the European Green Deal. Under the European Green Deal?s farm to fork and biodiversity strategies, the European Commission has set a target of ?at least 25% of the EU?s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030 and a significant increase in organic aquaculture?. To achieve this target and to help the organic sector reach its full potential, the Commission has put forward a new action plan for the development of organic production in the EU .
In 2020, 9,1% of the total EU?s agricultural land was under organic production. This number hides substantial differences between Member States as regards the share of agricultural land dedicated to organic farming: from 0.5% to more than 25%. These differences are partially due to the lack of structures adequate for organic farm products in some countries. In line with the EU action plan for the development of organic production, the successful proposals will support the establishment of adequate structures that enable the proper channelling of organic production in supply chains allowing farmers to fully benefit from the added value of organic production.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Reinforced local and small-volume processing of organic food;
?	Boosted innovative sustainable packaging solutions resulting in reduced waste (in particular of non-renewable and fossil derived plastics);
?	Fostered innovative supply and distribution models and short trade circuits;
?	Added value to organic agricultural products, improved organic farmers? incomes and their positioning in agri-food value chains;
?	Enhanced market orientation and capacity of organic farmers and small and medium scale processors to meet consumer demand for sustainable and healthy diets based on organic food;
?	Increased availability, affordability and accessibility of organic food with positive impacts on sustainability, including on biodiversity, on climate, ecosystems services and public health.
Scope: Organic farming has developed mainly at the primary production level, while the processing of organic farm products is less developed and regulated. Besides, the organic sector is characterised by its scattered nature, with imbalances in the food value chains limiting the bargaining power of organic farmers and producers still having access to a limited number of processors and retailers. Therefore, investing in innovative careful processing techniques and sustainable and reusable packaging, streamlining the distribution and logistics of organic produce and agricultural input networks, and achieving a better understanding of quality and safety issues in organic supply chains, in combination with regulations, is important for creating new value for consumers.
This will enable small organic producers, in particular those located in remote areas, to find an outlet for their production and benefit from the added value of their organic certification. However, operators are often reluctant to convert to organics due to the lack of organised and efficient organic commercial supply chains. In addition to the cross-cutting problems faced by agri-food supply chains, organic distribution can entail high operating costs and an imbalance between supply and demand. Exchanging experience and knowledge can encourage the creation of local food markets and short supply chains, and uphold the integrity of the organic quality of the product.
Proposals should establish and animate locally-driven, multi-actor organic food innovation hubs, bringing together researchers, innovators, farmers, processors and others, to:
?	Develop, test and pilot innovations in organic small-scale food processing, in particular careful processing, and new, sustainable and reusable packaging (avoiding non-renewable and fossil-derived plastics), optimising the preservation of nutritional quality, reducing perishability and ensuring food safety;
?	Foster diverse innovative solutions/approaches that are tailored to the needs of farmers and SMEs, while ensuring links between food processing and primary production, and adapted to the seasonal character of raw material production and processing in small(er) batches;
?	Develop and explore innovative supply and distribution models (including business models, market outlets and marketing strategies, short trade circuits, public procurement, food services), that are adapted to proposed innovative solutions;
?	Assess the impacts of the innovative solutions on sustainability (climate, environmental, social, including health, and economic);
?	Build a community of practice to share learnings, build capacity and support adoption of innovations at scale.
Proposals should cover a range of crops (indoor and outdoor), both arable and perennial, representative of the organic sector in Europe, as well as the organic livestock sector.
Projects must use the 'multi-actor approach', ensuring adequate involvement of all relevant actors, including farmers and SMEs. Proposals may build on existing research infrastructures, where relevant. Proposals are encouraged to build on past and ongoing EU-funded research and innovation projects, and are strongly encouraged to cluster with ongoing and upcoming projects. Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, in particular the topic in this Work Programme HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-20: Developing an EU advisory network on organic agriculture? and the future partnerships ?Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures? and ?Sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate?",

Activities will support Regulation (EU) 2016/2031  on protective measures against pests of plants.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Enlarged availability and accessibility to cost-efficient and user-friendly tools and methods for the detection of plant pests to assist plant health inspectors during import controls;
?	Increased the effectiveness of detection of plant pests at import points, by decreasing time and overall costs;
?	Knowledge exchange and uptake of the innovative tools are promoted;
?	Support plant health inspections and import controls.
Scope: Plant health is of global importance for agriculture, forestry, natural ecosystems, ecosystem services and biodiversity. Plant health is threatened by species injurious to plants and plant products, which now present a greater risk of being introduced into the Union territory owing to globalisation of trade and climate change. The current EU plant health legislative landscape aims at a proactive approach ensuring safe trade and mitigating the impacts of climate change on the health of the crops and forests in Europe.
Research activities should support these measures by contributing to the development of more rapid, reliable and economic innovative solutions and devices that can assist plant health inspectors at the borders. Technologies such as e-noses, acoustic devices, scanners, and portable devices for molecular identification of plant pests  within hours/minutes of the specimen?s sampling often using limited amounts of plant or plant product material, and other relevant solutions, are included within the scope of this topic.
Proposals should:
?	Deliver more rapid, robust, and innovative solutions appropriate for detecting and identifying plant pests during import controls;
?	Make use of innovative technologies for the detection of a broader spectrum of plant pests;
?	Prove cost-benefits of the innovative solutions;
?	Promote a wider use of new detection technologies for plant health diagnostics.
Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as research, plant health services, industry including SMEs are brought together. Proposals should take due account of dissemination to relevant stakeholders to facilitate the uptake of results.
Proposals should specify how they plan to collaborate with other proposals selected under this and other relevant topics, e.g., by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Find adequate responses for EU quarantine plant pests;
?	Enhance capacities to prevent, monitor and (bio)control plant pests following under the scope of this topic;
?	Support to relevant EU and Associated Countries? plant health policies.
Scope: Plant health is of global importance for agriculture, forestry, natural ecosystems, ecosystem services and biodiversity. Plant health is threatened by species injurious to plants and plant products, which present a greater risk of being introduced into the Union territory due to globalisation, trade and climate change. The current EU Plant Health legislative landscape helps protect the EU against the introduction of new plant pests as well as tackling existing plant pests more effectively. The prevention of entry and, if arrived within the EU territory, early detection and eradication are part of the plant health policies to avoid significant impacts in agriculture, forestry and environment by plant pests.
Proposals should target one or more plant pest(s)  that are either Union quarantine plant pests  present in the EU or Union quarantine pests which are priority pests   in the EU, and that are of concern for agriculture and/or forestry , with the exception of plant pests targeted in Horizon Europe . Research activities should improve methods for an effective implementation of the principles of integrated pest management (IPM), whilst reflecting the move towards innovative biological and other non-chemical control and resistance breeding.
Proposals should:
?	Contribute to the understanding of the drivers of plant pest introduction, spread and establishment including the biology of the pest and its interaction with host plants and antagonists, the influence of climate change, ecosystem degradation, and globalisation;
?	Develop efficient surveillance methods and strategies for early-detection and (bio)control of the pest(s);
?	Extend the range of tools and technologies available for the development of economically and environmentally sound solutions for an effective pest prevention and outbreak management, and if relevant pursue in line with the principles of integrated pest management and taking into account the use of non-chemical or biological control methods;
?	Analyse the social and economic implications for farmers, foresters and other economic operators affected by the outbreaks of the plant pest(s) and developing approaches whereby those affected can best cope with the situation;
?	If relevant, analyse the ecological impact of plant pest(s) spread and establishment based on the experience obtained from existing outbreaks.
International cooperation with countries affected or threatened by the same pest(s) is strongly encouraged in particular to capitalise on existing knowledge. Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as research, plant health services, farming/forestry sectors, advisory services, and industry are brought together. Results of activities should benefit both conventional and organic farming.
Proposals should specify how they plan to collaborate with other proposals selected under this and other relevant topics , for example by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to cover these activities.
The possible participation of the JRC in the project will consist of supporting the analysis of social and economic implications for farmers, foresters and other economic operators affected by the plant pest(s) and developing approaches whereby those affected can best cope with the situation.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-5-two-stage, Animal nutritional requirements and nutritional value of feed under different production management conditions,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will support the objective of the farm to fork strategy to transition to a fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly European agriculture, and contribute to strengthen the resilience and sustainability of specific farming sectors and preserve biodiversity. It is expected to contribute to limit the reliance of the European agricultural sector to imported feed materials.
The proposed project will enhance the use of locally produced and more climate-friendly solutions for animal feed without compromising animal performance and productivity. It will focus on existing or alternative source of nutrients using value chain approaches to maximize feed production and feed use efficiency, supporting the local environment and farm circularity.
Activities under this topic will contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Guidelines for processes and policies for improved resource-efficient production, use, and diversification of safe feedstuffs;
?	Optimised use of feedstuffs, new plants, forage species and associations at local level;
?	Uptake by farmers of practices to diversify sources of feedstuffs and use of natural resources on rangeland, where appropriate;
?	(Alternative) Feed production/supply strategies that facilitate self-sufficiency and ensure safety of feed; closed nutrient cycle at local level and diminished environmental and climate footprint;
?	Improved systems for facilitating the planning and calculation of the rations/diets of feed adjusted to specific livestock and individual/group animal requirements, and for mitigating the risk of anti-nutritional factors or contaminants in feedstuffs.
Scope: Feed resources are important components of livestock production systems, and their efficient use is the primary determinant of animal performance and productivity. The availability and use of local feedstuffs, including new and underused sources, including alternative protein sources, is a challenge in many livestock farming systems and it has several implications in terms of farm economics, product quality and safety, animal health and welfare. Furthermore, there is the need to design more precise and resilient feeding systems while ensuring requirements of biodiversity protection and restoration.
The aim is to optimise the use of local feedstuffs, shorten supply chains and rely more on local resources. It is important to investigate content, availability and digestibility of nutrients in locally available feedstuffs in different pedo-climatic regions and livestock systems, without compromising feed safety and efficiency.
The following elements should be incorporated:
?	Determine and adjust net energy-based nutritional requirements (macro and micronutrients) for local breeds and different management conditions, addressing both conventional and organic livestock farming;
?	Assess on-farm practices and equipment to use feedstuffs more efficiently (post-harvest technologies, crops mixture, foraging strategies, rangeland management);
?	Take advantage of between and within breed genetic diversity to optimize the use (acceptance and feed efficiency) of local feedstuffs;
?	Evaluate the impacts of processing technologies on the efficiency of local feedstuffs
?	Improved knowledge on the effects of functional additives (enzymes, gut flora stabilisers, natural plants, vitamins, etc.) on farm-scale animal performance, health and welfare;
?	Assess and minimize the risk of anti-nutritional factors or contaminants such as biotoxins in feedstuffs,
?	Analyse and monitor the performance of the animal production systems and the quality of animal-based products under novel feeding strategies;
?	Determine better indicators of animal nutritional requirements and the nutritional value of locally produced feedstuffs
?	Assess the economic sustainability and environmental impact of identified resilient feeding systems and related structural changes (at local level)
If necessary, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under other topics and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China. This topic is within the scope of the Administrative Arrangement between the European Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People?s Republic of China on a Co-funding Mechanism for the period 2021-2024 to support collaborative research projects under the Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) and the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiatives.
Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs. Interaction with other actions developed under the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Research Flagship and the Flagship on Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) is encouraged if relevant",

?	Understanding of the resilience potential to climate change of exploited resources and build up the adaptive capacity for fisheries management;
?	Preparation of the seafood sector to seize opportunities to harvest shifting stocks in the most sustainable manner, taking into account environmental, social and economic considerations.
Scope: Proposals are expected to investigate the impacts of climate change on biological and ecological processes such as shifts in stocks distribution, abundance and density, fish health, stock productivity, habitats, regime shifts in ecosystems and altered growth, reproduction rates, seafood safety and overall changes in the ecosystem potential production. They should also explore and test innovative measures to mitigate climate change (such as new designs of fishing gears or new fishing strategies that do not resuspend carbon from the seabed or new fishing strategies which improve energy use efficiency or strengthen circularity aspects) and adaptive solutions (such as valorisation of new catches or building resilience actions).
Proposals should include studies representing the whole spectrum of European fisheries, including small-scale fisheries, and the related biotic, abiotic, social and economic conditions. They should follow an interdisciplinary approach and cover both scientific and socioeconomic aspects.
They should build on the work of Horizon 2020 projects ClimeFish and CERES and others and provide applicable approaches and tools to the fishing sector. They should also build on the work of initiatives such as the EMFF-funded studies on ?Climate change and the Common Fisheries Policy: adaptation and building resilience to the effects of climate change on fisheries and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from fishing?, and ?Adapting postharvest activities in the value chain of fisheries and aquaculture to the effects of climate change and mitigating their climate footprint through the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions?.

?	Contribution to technologically-advanced aquaculture production (indicatively through the use of techniques such as artificial intelligence, sensors, internet-of-things and robotics), fully embedded in natural, social, ethical and economic sustainability.
Scope: Proposals are expected to enhance knowledge of the impacts of climate change on aquaculture production at environmental, social and economic levels. They should identify, forecast and assess the main effects of climate change on different aquaculture production systems and on their ecological carrying capacity.
They should consider impacts of climate change such as water availability (e.g., rise in evaporation, decrease in rainfall, extreme weather events like droughts or floods), water quality (e.g., acidification, eutrophication, pollution, contamination), temperature rise, sea level rise, spread of diseases (e.g. recrudescence of endemic and emerging diseases in traditional and recirculating aquaculture systems), reduced fish welfare, invasive species, and other climate related risks.
They should also investigate adaptation and mitigation solutions and opportunities such as technological, social, economic, and biological/ecological aspects, selection of suitable sites, culture methods (including the contribution of organic production and integrated multi-trophic aquaculture), species plasticity and adaptability to changing environments as well as breeding and selection techniques for a more sustainable, productive and resilient production.
Furthermore, they should address aspects of circularity in terms of more efficient use of resources and less negative impacts on marine environment, including reduction, valorisation, and reuse of waste. Indicative aspects could include Life Cycle Assessment approaches such as of feeding systems and valorisation of non-food biomass for feeds and fertilisers.
Proposals should build on the work of Horizon 2020 and EMFF projects, such as ClimeFish and CERES, and provide applicable approaches and tools to the aquaculture sector.

?	Enhanced knowledge transfer and exchange of best practices between organisations that support circular economy at the local and regional scale;
?	More widespread dissemination of circular innovation, including technological, business, governance and social innovation, which lead to an uptake and easier replication, scalability and visibility of circular systemic solutions and hence multiplication of their economic, social and environmental benefits at the local and regional scale;
?	Increased contribution of the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) scheme to the policy targets of the European Green Deal, particularly the circular economy action plan, the industrial strategy and the bioeconomy strategy at local, regional, national, European and international levels.
Scope: As part of the EU circular economy action plan, the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI)  supports the implementation of circular systemic solutions at the local and regional levels by providing financial and technical assistance to cities and regions in the EU and Associated Countries. The CCRI Coordination and Support Office (CCRI-CSO) is responsible for facilitating the implementation of the CCRI and supporting the cooperation, synergies and complementarities between the CCRI Pilot Group and Fellows, CCRI Projects and Associated Partners. In particular, the CCRI-CSO is responsible for providing practical and tailor-made support to the Pilot Group. The CCRI-CSO also helps to identify and analyse the main R&I gaps as well as the (technical, regulatory and financial) barriers and drivers to a local circular economy.
There is a wide range of organisations in Europe that focus on circular economy at the local and regional scale and have the potential to contribute to CCRI, by implementing activities ranging from political engagement, networking, dissemination, research, support to the development and implementation of circular economy action plans and other circular innovative solutions on the ground.
The objective of this topic is to strengthen the collaboration between various relevant initiatives and organisations that support circular economy at the local and regional scale, enhance their capacity to contribute to CCRI, while avoiding overlaps and duplications in their activities. Proposals should build on the activities of the CCRI-CSO, and ensure the proposed activities are complementary. Proposals should set out a clear plan on how they plan to collaborate with the CCRI-CSO, CCRI Pilots and Fellows, CCRI Projects and Associated Partners, for example by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities and/or providing additional technical expertise through dedicated support activities. Selected proposal will thus need to work together with the above-mentioned CCRI counterparts and, if needed, refine their work plan together with the Commission. All the proposals? activities must be coordinated and implemented in close cooperation and coordination with the CCRI-CSO, as well as explore the possibilities to further build on and make use of outputs produced, in order to ensure complementarities.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-01-2, One hundred circular model households:  making European households sustainable through inclusive circular practices,3/28/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00-3,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to the following Destination impacts: i) accelerate regional, rural, local/urban and consumer-based transitions, and ii) improve on consumer and citizen benefits.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Significant, well-documented increase in material efficiency in participating households;
?	Significant reduction of emissions of GHG and other pollutants, including micro- and nanoplastic fibres from covered households, and increase of carbon removals;
?	Improvement of living conditions in participating households;
?	Multiplier effect regarding the replication of the approach and its benefits; leading by example;
?	Lessons learnt for a European rollout strategy and integration with sectoral strategies such as Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI).
Scope: The transition from a take-make-waste society to sustainability, resource-efficiency and circularity will have to happen on the ground in the living environment, i.e. at the consumers? homes, or it will not happen at all. We therefore should reduce the environmental footprint of households, and think about an ambitious GHG reduction target for households that could be tested at large scale via research and innovation funding. Areas to be addressed are e.g., household electronics, textiles, food, packaging and the respective waste, furniture, housing, modes of consumption in general, at the level of individual behavioural decisions. The feasibility of this approach should be demonstrated in pilots with NGOs and CSOs that directly target transformation in a certain number of individual households.
Although technology can contribute, the overall goal can only be achieved through behavioural change. Social and gender aspects are relevant. Proposals should demonstrate how sustainable products and/or services can better meet the real needs of citizens with regard to entertainment, communication, mobility, housing, etc., and how in return this will positively influence consumer behaviour.
This initiative complements the envisaged circular and biobased transition activities in cities and regions at a micro level, as it aims to target individual households. In this way, it will also target social disparity. It will experiment with different behavioural approaches in a scheme of 100 circular households. This R&I initiative will also support the Commission?s commitment in the 2020 circular economy action plan (CEAP) to present measures to make circularity work for people, regions and cities, to develop a sustainable product policy framework, to empower consumers and public buyers, and to focus on areas where the potential for circularity is high.
Through this initiative, a cost-free circular economy advisory service shall be provided to selected households. As a first step, all available knowledge on the measurement and calculation of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts from households, with particular attention to the above-mentioned consumption areas, will be screened and consolidated. A simple and robust method for a quick comparison of environmental impacts, using in particular PEF expertise, will be established.
Proposals shall define the exact scope of demonstration projects, e.g., to transform X households in Y Member States into model circularity/sustainability cells, with a focus on a limited number of material flows, and set reduction benchmarks that are ambitious and plausible, and that can be validated using the above-mentioned knowledge. In a second step, a support service directly targeted at citizens will be established. Similar to energy advisory services, material efficiency advisors will contact households and identify individual needs and optimisation potential. This can build on the infrastructure of the upcoming Circular Cities and Regions Initiative and other projects that operate at macro level, and on ongoing environmental NGO advisory activities. While the focus is on material flows, trade-offs between material and energy efficiency are to be avoided. All proposed measures have to respect the principles of non-toxicity and zero-pollution. The impact of all measures should be assessed from a lifecycle perspective.
The advisors will be the link between retailers/service providers, insurances etc., where necessary also public services and administration, and households. All proposed measures need to be easy to implement and at least cost-neutral for households. Measures will range from environmentally friendly purchasing, shared product use, swaps to optimised maintenance, upgrade, repair, down to waste disposal. Financing of significant expenses that can be a barrier to transition at household level, and amortisation issues need to be addressed in the context of the advisory service. The aim is also to debunk the notion that sustainable living is a privilege of the wealthy.
In a third step, results will be analysed and presented in a robust way that allows multiplication both through media initiatives and on the ground, via public authorities or directly by individual actors who want to replicate and implement successful circular measures in their remit. With regard to the territorial aspects of all proposed solutions, proposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission?s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) . Joint activities with CCRI projects are encouraged.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-01-3, Harnessing the innovation potential and market uptake of successful circular economy water related projects,3/28/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 2.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In support of the European Green Deal and EU water-related policies, successful proposals will contribute achieving sustainable and circular management and use of water resources, as well as prevention and removal of pollution, in particular the expected impact of the Destination ?Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors' to ?Accelerate transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive, just and clean circular economy based on enhanced knowledge and understanding of science?.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Boost the uptake of the most promising systemic solutions, innovative recovered products and related business models for sustainable wastewater treatment, recovery and reuse, removing relevant barriers and create a level playing field for innovative companies;
?	Change perception and behaviour of European citizens, removing social barriers with regard to wastewater management, recovery and the reuse of resources and energy
?	Enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing on water reuse and recovery, education, awareness, and professional skills development;
?	 Support the implementation of relevant EU policies (e.g., water and marine related policies, water reuse regulation, sludge and industrial emissions directive, climate change adaptation strategy, circular economy action plan, EU bioeconomy strategy and its action plan, EU zero pollution action plan).
Scope: The water sector is facing important transformations in order to ensure resource efficiency, food and water security and meet relevant targets of the EGD. Transitioning to a circular economy and bioeconomy present a big opportunity for that.
Past and ongoing EU funded projects demonstrated the benefits of applying circular economy and bioeconomy principles to water systems and provided interesting case studies on various circular water management approaches and business models, and insights on how materials, water, energy, products and components can be managed in such a way, they can maintain their highest possible intrinsic value. However, the uptake of innovative circular water solutions (e.g., recovered products) is hindered by the lack of a common understanding of benefits of systemic solutions and the lack of a systematic analysis of the various, technological, regulatory and social barriers. Raising, for instance, public awareness, stakeholder and business engagement on the use of recovered products (water, nutrients, other resources) is crucial for overcoming social barriers and other regulatory ones as well as for enabling policy developments.
There is therefore the need to create a critical mass for knowledge exchange, to further promote the dissemination and exploitation of EU funded research results, to remove social barriers, facilitate their use by various stakeholders, reduce unnecessary duplication of efforts, ensure/demonstrate public and stakeholders engagement in developing business opportunities of circular use of water and identify wider policy implementation opportunities as well as, opportunities to accelerate and scale-up various scientific and technological advances that support greater water efficiency and reuse in various sectors and promote innovation and business development.
This action should bring together relevant business representatives, investors water utilities, policy makers, researchers, technology providers, water utilities, and other water users and citizens from past and ongoing successful EU funded R&I projects on the circular use of water, to take stock of the outcomes of major results with regards to technologies, eco-innovative solutions and related business models for sustainable treatment and practices of stakeholders and water managers involvement, recovery and reuse of relevant resources from wastewater and sewage sludge (e.g., nutrients, metals, energy, etc.). The involvement of relevant EU water EU associations and supporting platforms should be encouraged, as they play an important role in bringing together different stakeholders (industry, science, regulators, consumers and downstream users) and different sectors (recycling technologies, waste industry, user industries and agriculture) for knowledge transfer, dialogue and confidence building utility associations. The inclusion of relevant SSH expertise would be also needed to help achieving the social related expected outcomes of this action.
For achieving these objectives the action should analyse relevant results and experiences and provide guidance related to the transition pathways that would enable water management authorities and utilities to navigate through water, material and energy pathways. Various business models for future replication, use, policy and market uptake of project results, should be also analysed, as well as related regulatory and/or market barriers. Recommendations for best practices to engaging the public and user industries (such as the food industry for nutrients or the biobased industry for biomasses) in co-design and co-creation processes that can speed up the market uptake of the solutions should be provided, as well as recommendations for future research needs.
The action should:
?	Assess how digital business models can further support water reuse, energy and resource recovery along the water cycle and help to increase awareness of the water sector operators concerning the water-energy-carbon nexus and longer-term impact of their day-by-day activity and promote actions for their market uptake.
?	Assess the social, environmental and economic impacts of various project results and their contribution the aims of various related EU policies. The full cost of service should be considered within the water sector. This includes the capital and operating expenses, cost savings from recovered products, the environmental and social aspects of water cycle management.
?	Propose a roadmap, recommendations and guidance on the standardisation of water products, in relation to secondary raw materials from wastewater treatment plants, including standardized key performance indicators and product certification schemes. In this context it would be also useful to assess to what extent, the development of niche markets and decentralised logistics/business models could further support the market uptake of recovered products.
?	Propose a roadmap and action plan to address the social perception and related biases of water reclamation and reuse with a view to increasing awareness among various water users and citizens in general.
?	Develop new education and training programmes to upskill young professionals in relevant sectors in relation to the circular use of water along the water cycle.
?	Define and propose national and EU-harmonized end-of-waste criteria for the recovered materials.  ",

It will also contribute via research on biotechnology and other enabling technologies, as a prerequisite and driver of future solutions for the bioeconomy transition.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Enhanced understanding of terrestrial biodiversity and the limits and potentials of its valorisation;
?	Addressing the need of sustainable sourcing and development of novel natural, sustainable and ?eco-friendly? (including ?climate-friendly?) materials and product ingredients for various sectors and applications. These will eventually deliver clear-cut benefits for consumers by being more effective and/or eco-friendly, cheaper, better for climate, and more readily accessible than existing fossil-based alternatives;
?	Improved sustainable exploitation, cultivation and processing methods based on promising species/organisms (including complex inter-species communities), and chosen production routes; leading to a diminished pressure on the natural resources (especially biodiversity) in situ.
?	Increased competitiveness of European biotechnology, in particular the SMEs sector.
?	Increased public knowledge and awareness of connections between biodiversity and biotechnology and its potentials, leading to increased trust in the scientific approaches based on informed and robust communication and mutual-learning efforts.
Scope: Global terrestrial biodiversity remains a largely untapped source of natural bioactive molecules and compounds, often combined with interesting potential functional properties of high economic and social value. Such chemical diversity and structural complexity may be matched with biological potency and selectivity. While some of the natural biochemical diversity has been studied , the potential for developing new applications and products is far from exhausted . There are still significant opportunities to improve the biodiscovery process as well as understanding of specific biochemical pathways leading to high-value applications, especially with those with a reduced Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, in various sectors, based on novel biochemicals and functional bio-based materials.
This will increase capacity in the European biotechnology sector and other industries to respond to society?s needs. The challenge is to match sustainable sourcing and processing with efficient and cost-effective use. This calls for close cooperation between industrial and academic partners, with due consideration for health/safety and environmental legislation, and informed public engagement.
Activities should address:
?	Technical improvements of the bioprospecting of any land-based organisms for potential bioactive compounds and functional materials, based on identified suitable sources of feedstock. The bioprospecting may be ?bio-guided? by the study of chemical ecology interspecific interactions (symbiotic/defence) such as, for instance, plant-insects, or microbial-insect/plant/fungus interactions.
?	Addressing sustainable biodiscovery, including by advanced detection methods, such as in silico database analysis, microfluidics/lab-on-chip, high-throughput screening, machine learning, etc, overcoming the issues of low concentrations of target molecules, and their general scarcity, and use of natural biological resources from diverse terrestrial environments and ecosystems, allowing better assessment of the selected bioactivity/functional property potential.
?	Defining and assessing the optimal further production routes via innovative approaches and systems/platforms (e.g., biotechnology, hydroponics, bioreactors), as well as economic feasibility assessment of these options for resulting bioactive compounds and functional materials, ensuring full valorisation of biomass and all by-products in the production routes, and biomass? sustainable supply, and, if appropriate, proposing an outline of continuation of the end-product development beyond the project timeline and its present resources.
?	Assessing and clearly communicating, by inclusive communication and dissemination strategies, the environmental and climate benefits (e.g., by lowering the pressure on the natural habitats (decrease of harvesting in situ), supporting nature conservation, and increase overall resource efficiency and sustainability), while expanding the range of natural ingredients for the new applications in industrial sectors.
?	Covering the environmental, climate and safety/health impacts of the developed ingredients or processes, using Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies based on available standards, certification, and accepted and validated approaches. Estimate of possible negative environmental impacts and trade-offs should be provided. The need to guarantee biodiversity preservation and compliance with relevant international rules on access to biological resources, their sustainable use and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from their utilisation, with the national regulations in the source countries and with the Convention on Biological Diversity and its Nagoya Protocol.
?	Food, biofuel and bioenergy applications are not in scope. Agricultural crop protection products (chemical pesticide substitutes) are also not in scope, to avoid overlaps with a parallel topic . Marine and aquatic ecosystems are also out of scope to avoid overlap with parallel topics  and projects funded under the recent call . For any health-related applications, complementarities with Horizon Europe Cluster 1 ?Health? should be carefully explored, to avoid duplications, and seek synergies.
Where relevant, and to increase impact, proposals should seek links and synergies as well as capitalise on the results of past and ongoing research projects  (including under the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) / Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU)).

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-01-5, Broadening the spectrum of robust enzymes and microbial hosts in industrial biotechnology,3/28/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to Destination ?Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors? impacts, in line with the European Green Deal, the EU bioeconomy strategy & its action plan as well as the EU industrial strategy. A proposal is expected to address in particular: i) developing innovative and sustainable value-chains in the bio-based sectors and ii) enhancing European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence. Expected impacts will be achieved via research and innovation on industrial biotechnology and other enabling technologies, as a prerequisite and driver of future solutions for the bioeconomy transition.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Enhanced EU bio-based sector competitiveness, sustainability and resource independence, including SMEs. More specifically, successful projects will contribute to a paradigm shift from enzymes and industrial microbial-hosts dependent processes to evolved microbial hosts and enzymes, for improved (bio-based) process/production robustness and flexibility.
?	Enabling environmental performance improvements of bio-based processes (encompassing climate-neutrality, circularity and zero pollution) through resource efficient valorisation of sustainable biomass feedstock, while addressing pollution issues in production processes.
?	Long-term benefits to the bio-based sector, consumers and end-users, by more environmentally-friendly as well as more technically and economically feasible applications in diverse value chains, also underpinned by progress in industrial biotechnology.
Scope: The overall scope focuses on widening the range of known robust enzymatic catalysts and industrial microbial hosts,  as well as on the potential of scaling up their deployment and thus exploring their potential to offer significant gains in bio-based processes and their flexibility against variable process parameters, namely: resource efficiency, energy efficiency and other process metrics. These efforts will then eventually aim for development of novel, or significantly optimised, sustainable (bio-based) processes and products (e.g. chemicals, materials).
Proposals should address:
?	Identification and bioprospecting of novel natural enzymes and/or microbial hosts, including though the use of existing sequencing data, from all types of environments (especially terrestrial but also marine).  The identified solutions must especially address extreme habitats (relevant to bio-based processes conditions/ challenges-see next point).
?	Optimisation of enzymes? and/or microbial hosts? properties for industrial use, addressing (bio-based) process conditions barriers. Such barriers comprise of physical parameters (e.g., temperature, pH) and chemical parameters/stressors (e.g., solvents, variable biomass feedstock composition, contaminants etc.). Optimisation efforts may include understanding, modification and control of microbial hosts and enzymes, (e.g. via Synthetic Biology methodologies).
?	Testing and demonstrating of novel concepts for industrial enzyme-catalysed or microbial host-based processes (e.g., engineering of enzyme cascades/multi-enzyme reactions, co-factor regeneration, broader range of functional activity etc.) to valorise biomass and produce high-value bio-based products.
?	Demonstrating optimised process design, development and control aspects, with considerations for implementation of automation, integration of unit operations, robust and precise process analytical technologies (PAT), and the horizontal incorporation of enabling digital technologies, where necessary for improving process efficiency but also achieving environmental performance improvements.
?	Assessment of the tested, optimized enzyme-catalysed or microbial host-based processes with respect to biotechnological, economic, environmental performance (lifecycle assessment) as well as safety parameters and standards.
?	Linking to the ongoing work on sustainability improvements via industrial biotechnology , if underpinned by the thematic focus on enzymes.
?	Beneficiaries should pay attention to the delivery of FAIR data, results and methodologies.
Where relevant, proposals should overall seek links and synergies as well as capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU research projects  of Horizon 2020, LIFE, Horizon Europe (including the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) /Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU)).

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-01-6, Bio-based solutions for humanitarian applications,3/28/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 1.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Successful proposals will contribute to Destination ?Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors? impacts, including: i) accelerating transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive, just and clean circular economy and bioeconomy, ii) developing innovative and sustainable value-chains in the bio-based sectors as well as iii) improving citizen benefits by establishing circular and bio-based systems based on sustainability, inclusiveness, zero pollution.
More precisely, successful proposals will provide humanitarian aid operators and bio-based sector stakeholders, with science-based information on the application potential, sustainable performances and circularity of bio-based solutions and options, suitable for humanitarian purposes. Projects? results will thus contribute to further improve on the social benefits of bio-based systems, in line with the European Green Deal, the bioeconomy strategy, the EU circular economy action plan and the EU zero pollution action plan.
Projects results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Identification of sustainable bio-based solutions of applicable performance under humanitarian aid contexts, addressing the technical challenges posed by diverse environmental, social and economic conditions.
?	Improved way to address waste management and waste-related challenges in humanitarian aid contexts.
?	Significant reduction/minimisation of waste (e.g., plastic or fibres waste) littered in the environment.
Scope: The global solid waste management crisis (and any related pollution) is increasingly urgent to address and it can disproportionately affect countries that commonly receive humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian aid, including EU-funded aid, is delivered both within EU boundaries and beyond, including to remote areas, posing logistics challenges of waste management. This call would contribute by examining on how bio-based products and systems could contribute to managing environmental challenges relevant to waste in humanitarian contexts. For example, based on existing assessment studies , issues pertain with durability of materials compared to the timeframe needed for their integrity to guarantee necessary quality, cost effectiveness of managing waste, prevention of littering, safety to end-users and operators as well reuse, recycling, or biodegradability and composting of waste materials in humanitarian settings.
Proposals should:
?	Assess the scope for which bio-based innovative technological solutions as well as bio-based systems have more environmentally sound applicability (including zero pollution and climate change considerations) for different and relevant applications,  under humanitarian contexts (scoping exercise).
?	Evaluate socio-economic/governance aspects, including the replication potential of appropriate solutions.
?	Include appropriate lifecycle assessment methodologies to examine the potential to reduce the environmental impact (accounting also for biodiversity, ecosystems preservation and enhancement, zero pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions) of proposed solutions, under relevant humanitarian aid conditions (variable environmental, social and economic conditions).
?	Develop guidelines and recommendations to policy makers, bio-based sector actors as well as humanitarian aid operators/practitioners (e.g., NGOs). Such guidelines can address further R&D&I needs and socioeconomic considerations, detailing on the potential of bio-based products and bio-based systems for uptake, based on the scoping exercise and a SWOT analysis. For all aforementioned aspects, humanitarian context specificity is crucial and must be taken into account for the analysis.
?	Implement multi-actor approach (MAA) by involving a wide range of bio-based sector actors, humanitarian aid actors as well as other relevant stakeholders, accounting also for trans- and inter-disciplinary research.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links and synergies as well as capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU research projects   (Horizon 2020, LIFE, Horizon Europe, including the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) / Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU)).

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-01-7, Symbiosis in the bio-based industrial ecosystems,3/28/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 1.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Successful proposals will enable the bio-based industries in the Union to contribute to the enhancement of European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence, developing industrial symbiosis and circularity by design and to the development of innovative and sustainable value-chains in the bio-based sectors as a prerequisite and driver of future solutions for a circular economy and the bioeconomy transitions. Projects results will contribute to deliver bio-based solutions with reduced environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, in line with the EGD objectives, the EU circular economy action plan, the bioeconomy strategy and the implementation of the transition pathway for the EU chemicals industry.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Innovative processes and industrial symbiosis approaches in the bio-based industrial value chains, enabling local security of supply chains and the maximum valorisation of biological resources while minimizing the use of hazardous substances and waste streams;
?	Monitoring systems of the industrial symbiosis in the bio-based industrial value chains.
Scope: In the transition towards an effective circularity and zero pollution within the industrial ecosystems in the Union, the production of goods and services must optimize the use of any resource. Industrial symbiosis is instrumental to this goal, as it is based on the sharing of resources between facilities when wastes or by-products from an industry or industrial process becomes the raw material for another. A well-developed symbiosis across bio-based facilities aims at zero-waste value chains, ensuring more local supply chains, minimizing the use of input material resources, while reducing all the environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, of all the processes involved. This should also bring an increase in the economic value of final products and a better distribution of economic and social benefits among the stakeholders. Industrial bio-based facilities within the scope of this topic include those producing bio-based materials and products (e.g., paints, coatings, inks and dyes, polymers, construction materials, fibres, personal care products, plasticisers, adhesive, lubricants, platform chemicals, solvents, surfactants, etc.).
To improve the knowledge for the implementation and scaling up of industrial symbiosis in the bio-based industries proposals should:
?	Analyse the applicability of existing methods and approaches individuating and assessing technical solutions enabling the symbiosis to specific sectors/facilities within the bio-based industrial ecosystems (but also their symbiosis with non-bio-based industrial assets), including supported by digital innovation and AI, based on existing studies  and on the knowledge collected and elaborated under the European Community of Practice  (ECoP);
?	Improve existing and/or develop new methods to assess the circularity and symbiosis of bio-based industrial ecosystems, taking into considerations specific KPIs developed in the above-mentioned ECoP;
?	Assess and optimize the environmental sustainability of symbiotic processes in terms of (decreased) impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate;
?	Evaluate the economic and social benefits of the industrial symbiosis assets in terms of increased economic value of final industrial products, better distribution of economic and social benefits among the stakeholders, improved utilisation of local supply chains, and integration in local (national and regional) strategies supporting circular approaches;
?	Individuate high-potential regions/areas, or specific industrial hubs for the demonstration of the developed symbiotic approach. Criteria for the individuation of such sites should focus on process level, symbiosis process implementation, commitment level of the local authorities and communities, regional specificities (business/industrial policy and strategies), additional funding, potential private investors, etc., also taking stock from the EU Hubs for Circularity (H4C) experiences ;
?	Engage with stakeholders, including local authorities and communities to disseminate the social and economic benefits from innovation in industrial symbiosis, bio-based industries, universities or other educational institutions to facilitate the training of circular practitioners;
?	Develop a targeted reporting system of the effectiveness of the technical solutions, based on ad-hoc monitoring capacity along the bio-based value chains working in symbiosis.
Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative by interacting with the NEB Community, NEB Lab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practices, and, where relevant, results.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU funded projects, including under the Circular Bio-based Europe JU and other partnerships of Horizon Europe and beyond.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Higher environmental sustainability, including on the climate targets (primarily reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and accessorily increase of carbon removals), and zero pollution demonstrated by LCA approaches of bio-based materials and products for construction applications, allowing their intensified sustainable use, under the New European Bauhaus Initiative  and the Renovation Wave ;
?	Demonstrated non-toxic and zero-pollution properties of the construction materials, as well as their recyclability and/or reusability, to respond to the higher societal demand and the objectives of the European Green Deal;
?	Increased competitiveness of European industry, including SME sector, and involving various actors of bio-based value chains; while ensuring affordable and sustainable end-products for the consumers and society, including via integration of digital solutions;
?	Improved innovation potential in regard to biotechnology, and its potential contribution to the sustainable, circular bio-based materials and biochemicals, with safe, environmentally-friendly and functionally performing applications;
?	Improved societal innovation and creativity, with inclusive engagement of all societal actors, especially professional bodies, policymakers, designers, architects, consumers and end-users, for the bio-based construction product segments. This is expected to contribute, e.g., by developing recommendations or guidelines, or public engagement/dialogue, to the policy-feedback on innovative construction materials, and to resolving related regulatory bottlenecks.
Scope: Bio-based construction materials offer major opportunities to contribute to the climate-neutral and zero-pollution objectives of the European Green Deal, replacing fossil-based alternatives, and so, reducing the environmental footprint, while offering economic benefits to the actors involved. However, care needs to be taken to ensure sustainability of sourcing and production process, while guaranteeing safety and positive user experience. This calls for high level of innovation and creativity, ensuring full inclusiveness of participation for all actors.
Proposals will focus on:
?	Identification and upscaling of bio-based materials suitable for the construction sector, understood as bio-based feedstocks, e.g. agro-forestry  residues, fibres, recycled organic materials, industrial by-products etc, obtained especially by higher circularity of available biomass, under the cascading use of biomass principle. However, the selected materials can also be found in other bio-based resources that, due to their specific genetic / physiological / biochemical backgrounds have functional properties, which can be further improved or upgraded by fermentation, biomanufacturing, or biotechnology approaches. Also, the hybrid integration of living organisms into traditional or bio-based construction materials (e.g., plants, algae, fungi) might be considered, if leading to higher quality and improved environmental impact. The range of final construction materials is broad and may cover composites, insulation materials, interior or exterior elements, adhesives, etc., depending on the construction value chain selected.
?	Innovating in terms of bio-based production improvements (e.g., additive bio-based manufacturing, nature-based solutions, or composite materials with added functionalities), leading to new construction-oriented consumer applications. This effort should benefit from innovation developed both from the technical angle, but also from social innovation and from inclusive participation of all actors, including development of recommendations for pre-normative or/and regulatory actions, related to new (recyclable/reusable) bio-based construction materials, as appropriate.
?	The safety and user experience aspects should be duly considered and included in the developed solutions.
?	Communication and dissemination will form an essential part of the projects, especially as related to the sustainability, ?reconnection with nature? and inclusiveness aspects.
?	Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and other relevant topics.
?	International cooperation is encouraged to benefit from exchange of best practices, while taking care of European (industrial) competitiveness.
?	SSH aspects should be considered and covered, as well as the contribution from digital solutions",

?	Diversification and enhancement of agricultural incomes (organic and conventional farming) and transition towards sustainable food systems in line with the farm to fork strategy.
?	Enhanced cooperation between primary producers and other key actors along the value chain in the bio-based economy.
Scope: The circular use of waste, by-products and residues from agriculture, forestry, and the agri-food industry can lead to the creation of new economic opportunities in rural areas. However, primary producers are often not fully integrated in bio-based value chains, and thus, benefits are not sufficiently distributed among value chain actors.
This topic addresses diverse forms of cooperation among primary producers and suitable business models to create high-value bio-based products in vertically integrated value chains via advanced biorefineries.
Proposals will:
?	Examine the potential of contractual agreements or fully developed shareholder/ownership concepts (e.g., cooperatives) to create sustainable and competitive innovations in the bio-based economy through the conversion of by-products, residues and wastes from agriculture and forestry.

?	Expansion of the potential offered by marine or other aquatic biological resources through advances based on the greater knowledge of the functioning, processes and ecological interactions of marine and other aquatic organisms;
?	Development of aquatic biotechnology solutions in cultivation and optimisation of production yield;
?	Increased bio discovery of products through sustainable methods for robust aquatic bio-based production, including possibly production of chassis cells, as an alternative to wild harvesting;
?	Support to green industrial bioprocessing and more sustainable bio-based products through new biotechnology processes and applications;
?	Contribution to the development of circular processing.
Scope: The biotechnological exploitation of both pelagic and benthic marine and other aquatic (such as the ones living in fresh waters, transitional waters and ice ecosystems) organisms often requires their cultivation and the optimisation of production yield for the compounds of interest. Aquatic biota, and in particular marine ones (bacteria, algae, fungi or invertebrates such as sponges, corals and molluscs), cannot be easily cultured. It is believed that just a fraction of 1% of marine bacteria can be cultured using existing methods, and viruses and bacterial and viral phages, present even greater challenges. The culturing of aquatic organisms offers a sustainable alternative to wild harvesting. The potential environmental footprint and impact on health, sustainability and biodiversity aspects need, nevertheless, to be thoroughly assessed and safety established, through risks analysis linked to possible dissemination of newly developed organisms in nature. Culturing methods should be developed in sealed conditions, such completely in vitro or in aquaria and mesocosms, with particular attention to avoid spread of non-indigenous species in the natural aquatic environment.
Proposals under this topic should:
?	Develop culturing methods (including for mixed cultures) for vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines for the production of active compounds particularly based on co-metabolism between community members that represent a radical change from the conventional ?isolate and enrich? approach to cell culture;
?	Develop bio-engineering tools for the use of marine and other aquatic model organisms to improve the availability of metabolites for industrial applications;
?	Optimise culturing conditions so that the relevant metabolites are appropriately expressed and can be recovered with selective downstream processing techniques.
Selected projects should collaborate with each other. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement",

Scope: European forests belong to around 16 million owners, whereby about 60% of the forest area is privately owned, the majority being small properties, often lacking proper attention by their owners mainly due to fragmentation and non-profitability. Knowledge on small-scale private forest owners? expertise, skills, motivations and needs to manage forests sustainably, including both traditional and non-traditional owner types, is limited.
Genuinely trans-disciplinary approaches in research and innovation are needed that combine the environmental and socio-economic dimensions and closely engage with broader stakeholder communities.
This topic addresses sustainable production potentials with a view to securing and promoting small-scale forest management for the sustainable use of wood and non-wood products, while fully respecting the cascading use principle and contributing to biodiversity objectives, including forest ecosystem restoration and protection.
Proposals will:
?	Create a better understanding of the circumstances of small forest property owners and behaviour for both traditional and non-traditional owner types.
?	Explore, analyse, and develop innovative forest management approaches, including silvicultural practices, carbon farming, digital tools (for example blockchain, robotics, AI or IoT/sensors), organisational, cooperation and business models, advisory services, education and training concepts, policy frameworks and social and institutional models that take into account different ownership types.

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Improved integrated management concepts with a focus on market-oriented approaches to meet the growing demand for ecosystem services, including carbon removals through carbon farming.
?	Development of decision support and management tools (including digital technologies such as AI, sensors or robotics) that will facilitate the joint delivery of multiple ecosystem services.
?	Increased long-term resilience of forest production and use systems and associated value chains.
?	Improved guidelines on carbon farming and PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services) design and implementation in Europe formulated and implemented.
?	Accelerated uptake of sustainable business models in the primary production sector.
Scope: Forests provide invaluable benefits to people and the planet. They are biodiversity hubs and habitats, vital for climate and water regulation, soil stabilisation and the purification of air and water. Their carbon sequestration and storage capacity make them an important alley in the fight against climate change. Also, forests and the forest-based sector provide multiple socio-economic functions and benefits, including jobs and development possibilities in rural areas. Their role in providing food, medicines and materials and their value for recreation and learning from nature is indispensable for the transition to a circular bioeconomy and a healthy society.
However, there is an increasing demand on European forests to provide a high diversity of goods and ecosystem services at the same time. The choice of forest management can produce different outcomes for ecosystem services and productivity in the short and the long-term. Forest owners should consider possible trade-offs and synergies with regards to the multifunctional role of forests, their interaction with climate change and their role for biodiversity. Therefore, there is a need for balanced and integrative approaches to ensure ecosystem services in the long-term and to provide sufficient resources for a sustainable and circular bioeconomy, while at the same time, contributing to GHG emissions reductions and carbon removals to contribute to 2030 and 2050 EU climate targets.
This topic addresses new opportunities for primary producers to diversify the income by developing new sustainable business models.
Proposals will:
?	Set-up a transdisciplinary forum at the science-policy-society interface to regularly disseminate research results, discuss options for upscaling promising approaches (including technological needs and possible solutions) and collaborate with relevant policy makers, stakeholders and the wider public.
?	Explore the evolving societal demands under changing climate conditions for different forest goods and services in an interdisciplinary and integrative approach to improve the knowledge that will help to balance the demands while safeguarding forest?s capacities to deliver them in the best possible way.
?	Based on previous research results (.e.g., InnoForest , Sincere , etc.), improve the understanding of ecosystem service interactions at different temporal scales both short-term and long-term and consider relevant social, environmental and economic interdependencies and path dependencies.
?	Identify region and national specific market-driven approaches to create new or reactivate value chains and business models based on co-operation between forest owners, policymakers and users of ecosystem services with a view to develop tailor-made solutions and strengthen interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation.
?	Select a set of representative European PES cases, including carbon farming cases, with sufficient implementation length and data availability for a holistic impact evaluation.
?	Analyse and compare the data for contextualizing results vis-a-vis the existing literature on PES design and implementation, including carbon farming.
?	Improve existing and develop new business models to determine the value and possible funding of sustainable forest management, including through the valuation of ecosystem services such as biodiversity, non-wood products, carbon sequestration and storage, clean water supply, soil protection, recreation, health amenities etc.; and develop standardized methods for their valuation where needed with the goal to maximise sustainable benefit across ecosystem services.
?	Propose standards for measuring, assessing and valuating ecosystem services in different regional settings, which could lead to more efficient market mechanisms across Europe in support of forest management practices ensuring sustainable use and biodiversity conservation and restoration.
?	Promote and provide advice for the set-up of adequate payment schemes through private and public funding instruments at national and EU-level (including the CAP).
The project must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-01-14, Monitoring the multi-functionality of European forests,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 4.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic supports the implementation of the new EU forest strategy for 2030 by addressing the design of a comprehensive forest information system that align information on forest and soil state, the provision of ecosystem services (including biomass, biodiversity and carbon removals) and socio-economic demands on ecosystem services.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Development of a comprehensive information base for all stakeholders involved in forest matters, from policy making, through forest restoration and conservation planning and funding of such activities, to practical forest management.
?	Successful implementation of forest-related policy objectives under the European Green Deal, including the building of a forest-based bioeconomy, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the increase of carbon removals, the contribution to climate change adaptation, the provision of ecosystem services and the conservation and restoration of forest biodiversity.
?	Better understanding of the quantity and quality of European forests, their multifunctional role and resilience needs under climate change and contribution to halting the loss of biodiversity.
?	Efficient implementation of possible certification schemes in relation to forest multifunctionality (e.g., closer-to-nature forest management practices, carbon farming).
Scope: In the context of climate change impacts, accelerated biodiversity loss and the need to adjust our socio-economic system to a more sustainable alternative, forests play increasingly a double role as victim and part of the solution. While their resilience and potential are under threat, they help to mitigate climate change (e.g., through carbon sequestration), and contribute to climate change adaptation (buffering thermal variations or variations in water flows), harbour large parts of terrestrial biodiversity and provide feasible solutions to support the transition to a bioeconomy.
To adequately manage forests and the services they provide, reliable, up-to-date, and coherent European forest information is more important. However, one of the challenges remain how to integrate information from different sources on the many functions that forests fulfil and the benefits they provide to society. Currently, data are scattered and often focusing on a limited set of indicators, which do not adequately represent the multi-functionality of forests.
This topic addresses the design of a comprehensive forest information system that aligns information on forest state, ecosystem services (including biomass) provision and socio-economic ecosystem services demand.
Proposals will:
?	Develop a list of parameters relevant for monitoring of a range of ecosystems services provided by forests.
?	Consider the latest scientific knowledge and technology (e.g., through the use of AI, IoT/sensors, robotics and blockchain) for the development, combination, and utilization of reliable data from multiple sources (e.g., national forest inventories, remote sensing, environmental monitoring, large scale societal surveys, national or smaller-scale economic data etc.)
?	Assess and propose suitable solutions to make these data available, also by considering issues related to the governance and funding of a fully harmonised monitoring system at EU-level.
?	Engage in a structured dialogue with institutions and stakeholders, including the European Commission, national competent authorities, representatives of the forest-sector, as well as data providers to align the needs and possibilities of data collection, provision, and use.
The project must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties e.g. to primary producers, academic researchers, start-ups, SMEs, data providers, national administrations, and other multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate developed applications. A maximum of ? 60 000 per third party might be granted. Conditions for third parties support are set out in Part B of the General Annexes. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.
Proposals should build on past or ongoing research projects and collaborate with relevant initiatives, including the Forest Information System for Europe (FISE).
Cross-articulation with the other data spaces, and notably with the European Open Science Cloud should be foreseen, exploiting synergies and complementarities of the different approaches. Efforts should be made to increase the data availability in the appropriate data-infrastructures for further uses.
JRC is available for sharing and taking up results and findings on the monitoring of the forest ecosystem multifunctionality in the EU Observatory for Deforestation, Forest Degradation and Associated Drivers and JRC Big Data Analytics Platform.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-02-1-two-stage, Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI)?s circular systemic solutions,3/28/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,26-Sep-23,9.00 to 10.00-6,"Expected Outcome: Successful proposals will support the delivery of solutions to implement the European Green Deal, the EU circular economy action plan (CEAP) and the bioeconomy strategy. The topic will support the transition towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive and just circular economy at local and regional scale across regions of Europe, boosting interregional and cross border cooperation.
Proposals funded under this topic will form part of the demonstration projects for the implementation of the European Commission?s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) . Proposals are expected to provide policymakers, public and private investors and local communities with concrete and demonstrated examples of circular systemic solutions.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Significantly increased circularity, reduced GHG emissions, and where relevant increased carbon removals, in product value chains, and efficient valorisation of local resources in cities, regions or their groupings.
?	Creation of business opportunities and jobs in the circular economy at urban and/or regional scale.
?	Increased uptake and participation of citizens in circular and climate-neutral practices.
?	Enhanced knowledge transfer between the cities, regions or their groupings involved in the proposals financed under this topic and other cities and regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries.
?	More effective widespread uptake and easier replication, scalability and visibility of circular systemic solutions and hence multiplication of their economic, social and environmental benefits.
?	Contribution to achieving the policy targets of the European Green Deal, circular economy action plan, EU bioeconomy strategy and the European industrial strategy at local, regional, national, European and international levels.
Scope: In the context of this topic, a circular systemic solution is defined as demonstration project for deploying a circular and climate-neutral economy at urban and/or regional scale, involving key stakeholders and, ideally, addressing more than one product value chain. Proposals are expected to implement and demonstrate at large scale circular systemic solutions for the deployment of the circular economy (including the circular bioeconomy) in cities and regions or their groupings. They should form part of the implementation of the European Commission?s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and they should be carried out in close coordination and cooperation with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office (CCRI-CSO).
The implemented circular systemic solutions should address economic, social and environmental dimensions of the transition towards a circular economy and include science, technology and governance components. They should demonstrate circular innovative technologies, novel governance and business models and support the active participation of all relevant actors in cities, regions or their groupings. Examples of relevant actors are: public administrations (national/regional/local authorities) and utilities (public/private companies); private sector services and industries, including start-ups and small and medium enterprises (SMEs); research infrastructures, scientific and innovator communities including incubators and accelerators; financial intermediaries with a focus on environmental and social impact; venture capitalists and business angels; civil society, including citizens; and non-governmental organisations and philanthropy.
The implemented circular systemic solutions can address ideally more than one of the key product value chains set out in the new circular economy action plan, i.e.: batteries and vehicles, electronics and ICT, packaging, plastics, textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients.  The circular systemic solutions may also include nature-based solutions. Circular systemic solutions and the economic sectors involved in them should be selected and based on a detailed analysis of the cities, regions or their grouping?s socio-economic and environmental needs to be addressed, circular potential to be exploited and challenges to be tackled.
Circular systemic solutions should identify, analyse and, when feasible, quantify the economic, social and environmental benefits and trade-offs/challenges related to their implementation and demonstration. They should include the monitoring and evaluation of the transition towards a circular economy, identify their strengths and weaknesses as well as causes. They should analyse the encountered regulatory obstacles and drivers and provide clear and precise policy recommendations to improve circular economy. Each circular systemic solution should address environmental externalities and contribute to preserving and, where possible, increasing the well-being and the health conditions of the local communities involved in the transition towards a circular economy.
It is crucial that the circular systemic solutions implemented and their business models have a high replicability and scalability potential. This is fundamental to facilitate that circular systemic solutions demonstrated in specific areas should be replicated in others. During their implementation and by the end of their life cycle, the selected proposals are expected to share with all stakeholders clear and comprehensive guidelines on the circular systemic solutions adopted, including their strengths and challenges. They should also provide information on key barriers identified to avoid their emergence at early stages of replicating existing solutions. Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outcomes will be accessible through the CCRI website (incl. business models and other studies).
It is essential that proposals also ensure complementarity and cooperation with existing and future relevant European projects on the circular economy and the circular bioeconomy, with special reference to those on local and regional scale and avoid overlaps and repetition .
Citizen science could be appropriate mode of research to increased practices and participation of citizens in circular systemic solutions.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-02-2-two-stage," Novel, sustainable and circular bio-based textiles",3/28/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,26-Sep-23,Around 7.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to expected impacts under the Destination ?Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors?, in line with the European Green Deal, the EU bioeconomy strategy and its action plan, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the circular economy action plan (CEAP), the chemicals strategy for sustainability, the EU textiles strategy, the EU zero pollution action plan as well as the New European Bauhaus initiative and the EU industrial strategy.
In particular, expected impacts to be addressed by successful proposals include: i) enhancing European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence; ii) accelerating regional, rural, local, urban and consumer-based transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive, just and clean circular economy and bioeconomy as well as iii) the development of innovative and sustainable value-chains in the bio-based sectors, substituting fossil-based ones.
Proposal results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Significantly reduce the negative environmental impact of textiles throughout their lifecycle. This impact encompasses primary raw materials and water consumption, land use and indirect land use change, as well as GHGs and other pollutants emissions (zero pollution), via addressing circularity-by-design and sustainable production aspects (the latter including thus also resource efficiency and circularity of resources improvements).
?	Significantly increase recyclability and circularity of textiles; it is estimated that currently there is a very low rate of recyclability of textiles into new textiles, worldwide .
?	Increase the use of EU (locally/regionally-sourced) alternative, bio-based fibres (including the reuse of bio-based textiles in their present form and in novel forms of use).
?	Address social impacts (e.g., HS&E and working conditions), in addition to environmental effects; projects should ensure sustainable, circular and socially just textile production and consumption at EU level, while international cooperation is strongly encouraged. The latter will allow for enhancing further on the sustainable production and consumption of textiles while improving on the replication potential of the proposed innovations.
?	Empower and increase SMEs participation and improve academia/industry/feedstock &fibres suppliers? interactions and collaboration.
?	Establish new and innovative circular bio-based value chains with a positive impact on EU competitiveness and jobs creation at regional, rural and local levels.
Scope: Overall, the call addresses the design, demonstration and scale-up of production of sustainable and circular, bio-based textiles for one or more applications: e.g., technical textiles, garments, industrial textiles, home textiles; including also innovative smart textiles and those providing additional functionalities (e.g., antimicrobial or fire resistance properties). Blended, but only bio-based compositions, are included hereby.
More specifically, the overall scope should be addressed by the projects via:
?	Valorisation of secondary biomass, residues and under-utilised (primary or secondary) biomass (sustainable biomass sourcing, land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and biodiversity considerations should be addressed/showcased) for bio-based textiles. Moreover, the reuse of fibres from bio-based textiles to produce circular bio-based textiles is in scope;
?	Design for circularity, enabling thus material design for durability, end-of-life recyclability, re-use and upcycling (including usability of waste fibres), with attention to the final application(s)/end use of textiles;
?	Design for end-product quality, safety, and durability, with consideration of the sustainability and circularity of textiles value chains and the final application/end-use; this does include preventing micro- and nano- plastics/fibres release throughout the lifecycle of textiles;
?	Development, demonstration and scale-up of novel processes by deploying appropriate enabling technologies  to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of textiles, across their production steps (pre-treatment, mordanting, dyeing, and finishing steps), improving notably on climate neutrality and against zero pollution. Moreover, apply industrial, industrial-urban and other symbiosis concepts, where necessary to achieve and enhance targeted outcomes and impacts;
?	Assess the environmental and social sustainability performance of the proposed innovations (textiles production and textiles lifecycle), while including technoeconomic feasibility assessment as well. The methodologies of assessment should follow existing EU standards;
?	Integrate the Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design (SSbD) framework, developed by the Commission, for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials.  Contribute with and develop recommendations that can advance further the application of the SSbD framework. More specifically, provide thresholds that can support the criteria definition and improvements for the assessment SSbD methodologies, including any specificities related with bio-based textiles. Recommendations can also include identification of data gaps, especially safety, environmental, but also socio-economic factors, as well as priorities for data collection.
?	Address, consumer behaviour, acceptance and demand aspects for circular and sustainable bio-based textiles;
?	Assess existing barriers to implementing circular economy business models for textiles; on this basis create innovative, sustainable and circular business models for the (EU and local) production and consumption of circular bio-based textiles. The participation of industry and particularly SMEs is strongly encouraged.
Projects are also expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative by interacting with the NEB Community, NEB Lab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practice, and, where relevant, results.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU funded research projects, (Horizon 2020, LIFE, Horizon Europe) including the ones under the Circular Bio-based Europe JU (CBE JU) and other partnerships of Horizon Europe. ,
Proposals should also include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and other relevant topics.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CircBio-02-3-two-stage," Non-plant biomass feedstock for industrial applications:  technologies and processes to convert non-lignocellulosic biomass and waste into bio-based chemicals, materials and products, improving the cascading valorisation of biomass",3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,26-Sep-23,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to expected impacts under Destination ?Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors?, related to consumers and industry, and in line with: the European Green Deal, the circular economy action plan, EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU bioeconomy strategy & its action plan, the Waste Framework Directive and the EU industrial strategy.
In particular, expected impacts to be addressed by successful proposals include: i) developing innovative and sustainable value-chains in the bio-based sectors and ii) enhancing European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased sustainability of biomass resources valorised in industrial applications, lowering land dependence and Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) impacts, protecting biodiversity and respecting ecosystems integrity;
?	Contribution to climate-neutrality (primarily via reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and accessorily via increase of carbon removals),  zero pollution and resource efficiency via practical application of the circular (bio)economy concept;
?	Improved industrial competitiveness, strategic autonomy and resource independence of bio-based value chains of EU Member States and/or Associated Countries, due to more sustainable industrial products and practices.
?	Environmental, economic and social benefits on territorial and municipal level, due to increased circularity and upcycling of low-value, Non-Lignocellulosic Biomass (NLBM) (waste), of terrestrial or aquatic origin, including its upcycling into high-value applications.
?	SMEs engagement, including the regional dimension, for skilled jobs creation.
?	Increased cooperation and awareness across circular bio-based value chains, including waste managers, biomass feedstock providers, bio-based (process) industry, end-users and the civil society.
Scope: Circular bioeconomy will rely on the availability of diversified and low/no-ILUC (Indirect Land Use Change) sources of biomass but also on the ability to design, develop and scale-up processes to valorise such feedstock towards high-value, sustainable bio-based products. Non-Lignocellulosic Biomass (NLBM),  and related residual non-lignocellulosic biomass?, provide options beyond plant biomass. However, NLBM from aquatic and terrestrial sources, often face challenges to reach economies of scale and biorefining production intensification, driven also by a complex and varying feedstock composition.
 Project activities should address:
?	Identification and optimization of suitable NLBM feedstock, with focus on higher resources efficiency and circularity, while respecting the waste hierarchy principles. Such feedstock to be deployed in adequate production systems, including upcycling approaches. More specifically, design and develop innovative upstream and conversion processes at pilot scale (e.g., via application of enzymes, industrial microbial hosts, microbiomes from natural ecosystems and diverse industrial biotech or other appropriate enabling technologies);
?	Develop downstream conversion processes, building towards a targeted portfolio of high-value bio-based process outputs / bio-based products that can be later obtained in NLBM integrated biorefineries (of appropriate scale);
?	Assessment of the proposed/developed innovative processes against techno-economic feasibility to valorise NLBM (waste) (at different potential biorefinery scales), showcasing/ensuring process flexibility to cope with the composition heterogeneity of the chosen NLBM feedstock(s);
?	Application of ex ante life-cycle assessment methodologies to ensure gains in environmental performance (including biodiversity), but also socio-economic aspects, as well ensuring safety for the consumers and operators;
?	Enable participatory approaches and knowledge sharing across circular bio-based value chains. This includes feedstock providers (rural, coastal, urban and peri-urban dimensions, as appropriate), bio-based (process) industry, end-users and the civil society, aiming for a comprehensive scoping of challenges (multiple dimensions) and opportunities of valorising NLBM and NLBM waste.
?	Production of biofuels and bioenergy, as the main production focus, falls outside the scope of this topic (their co-production, while following the cascading biomass use principles, is not excluded though). Food/feed ingredients, cosmetics-related compounds and especially those with health-promoting properties (nutraceuticals), may be in scope, provided their toxicological and nutritional safety has been assessed and guaranteed at EU level.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links and synergies as well as capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU research projects under Horizon 2020, LIFE and Horizon Europe (especially under the Bio-based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) / Circular Bio-based Europe Joint Undertaking (CBE JU)) .

They will be carried out in close coordination and cooperation with the CCRI Coordination and Support Office (CCRI-CSO).
Investors and lenders need to gain more confidence in investment projects in the field of circular economy which are still seen as risky. European added value can be achieved, for example, where projects introduce innovation to the market regarding financing solutions minimising transaction costs and engaging the private finance community. European added value could also be achieved where projects demonstrably address legal, administrative and other market opportunities and challenges for innovative and sustainable circular economy investment schemes.

?	 Delivery of a series of sustainable circular economy projects;
?	 Roll-out of innovative financing solutions/schemes at local and regional scale across Europe.
Scope: The CCRI-PDA service targets public and private project promoters such as local and regional authorities or their groupings, public/private infrastructure operators and bodies, utilities and services, industry (including SMEs).
The purpose of the CCRI-PDA is to help project promoters develop their circular economy proposals at local and regional scale by bringing together the technical, economic and legal expertise.
The CCRI-PDA should provide support for those activities necessary to prepare and mobilise finance for investment projects, such as feasibility studies, stakeholder and community mobilisation, business plans and preparation for tendering procedures or setting up a specific financing scheme/financial engineering.
The CCRI-PDA should focus on activities aimed at increasing circularity in product value chains that are relevant for the transition towards a sustainable circular economy at local and/or regional scale. The economic sectors and investment proposals involved in each CCRI-PDA service should be clearly specified and selected according to local and/or regional circular economy needs, resources and potential. This selection should be clearly justified and explained.
Ideally, the proposed investments should be launched before the end of the project, which means that proposals should result in signed contracts with investors for circular economy investments at local and regional scale to that effect. Furthermore, the proposals should provide tangible showcases that trigger further market replication.
In addition, proposals should also include an exemplary/showcase to increase circularity in specific sector(s) at local and regional scale and/or in the size of the expected investments and leverage factors ;
In addition, all proposals should demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results to potential replicators across EU Member States and Associated Countries.
Indicatively, the CCRI-PDA focuses on small and medium-sized circular economy investments of up to EUR 20 million  (for a single proposal or a portfolio of proposals).
The EU contribution per proposal should not exceed 10% of the related investment.
Proposals should justify the budget for the project development assistance needed based on the expected investment portfolio to be set up. This includes the amount of investments that is expected to be triggered and the respective leverage factors to be achieved.
Proposals are expected to ensure synergies and complementarities with other EU financial schemes for circular economy projects. Proposals should ensure that all evidence, information and project outcomes will be accessible through the CCRI website (incl. business models and other studies).

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CircBio-01-2, Circular solutions for textile value chains based on extended producer responsibility,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 7.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to the following Destination impacts: i) enhance European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence, and ii) improve on consumer and citizen benefits.
Proposal results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Recommendations on best innovative solutions for the identification of material composition of used textiles/textile waste embedded in the design of textile products;
?	Recommendations on design for recycling for textile products that allows the use of targeted Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes;
?	Recommendations on policy tools to reach EU greenhouse gas reduction targets till 2050 (climate neutrality), including the 2030 target.
Scope: Textiles are the fourth highest-pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water and fifth for greenhouse gas emissions and a major source of microplastic pollution in production and use phases. They are also a key material and product stream in the circular economy action plan. Improvements in the circularity of the textile value chains will help reduce GHG emissions and environmental pressure. EPR schemes are a lever for circularity. The purpose of this topic is to enable the optimal functioning of EPR schemes for textiles within the EU and to take into account the commitments of the textile strategy on EPR. The circular economy action plan establishes the policy objective to make the textiles sector more sustainable by boosting the circularity of textile consumption i.a. through reuse, separate collection, sorting and recycling of textiles. It also wants to limit textile waste generation and restrict exports of waste that have harmful environmental and health impacts in third countries or that can be treated within the EU. Furthermore, increased amounts of separately collected textile waste are expected because of the Waste Framework Directive?s obligation to separately collect textiles as of 2025.
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes have proven to be an effective tool for improving the treatment of other waste streams and therefore are being considered as necessary in recent consultations by the stakeholders of the textile sector. In view of that, the Commission is assessing the feasibility of introducing EPR for textiles into EU legislation. Proposals should aim to support the high-quality separate collection, preparation for treatment and treatment of used textiles and textile waste, thereby enabling the optimal functioning of EPR schemes in this sector. It will do so by providing recommendations on improving the ease of identification of material composition in a wide range of used textile products/waste to inform the different actors in the use and end-of-life stages of textiles (consumers for use and disposal, social enterprises to enable reuse, waste management operators to enable preliminary treatment and treatment operations). To do so, it will inter alia identify, develop and test innovative labelling of textile products (including through the use of technologies such as AI, blockchain or Internet of Things) to ease separate collection for re-use or end-of-life treatment that leads to high quality secondary raw materials.
Proposals should bring together different stakeholders active in the sector along the value chain, such as waste collectors, waste sorters, repair and reuse organisations. Proposals should also try to address historical liabilities and the impact of textiles coming from outside the EU. Proposals should analyse how EPR schemes can improve the circularity of textiles, assess the material composition in a wide range of used textile products and waste with a view to targeted EPR schemes for improved collection and recycling, and test separate collection options for reuse or end-of-life treatment that could be enforced through EPR schemes. Projects should also identify novel solutions for textile reuse. They should also consider possible rebound effects and only propose measures that will not hamper the market uptake of more sustainable novel textile materials. Projects should also recommend/identify/define tools (policy, legislation, governance, market-based, etc.) that the EU institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council of the EU) could implement or propose in order to reduce the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the textile sector (including from final consumption, not only production) in the EU in line with the EU greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets till 2050 (climate neutrality), including the 2030 target; for this, the projects should take into account the relevant possible rebound effect.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CircBio-01-3, Innovative circular solutions for furniture,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to the following Destination impacts: i) enhance European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence, and ii) improve on consumer and citizen benefits.
Proposal results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased deployment and demonstrated benefits of advanced digital solutions (e.g., through AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain) in circular businesses including waste management and recycling
?	 Emergence of new value chains using upcycled, recycled and/or biobased;
?	resources, e.g. through industrial symbiosis, with particular attention to SMEs;
?	Increased recycling rates and upcycling to new higher-value products;
?	Increased uptake of recycled and/or renewable material;
?	Increased deployment and market uptake of circular design, including design for easy maintenance, repair, remanufacturing and recycling;
?	Increased reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing rates and diffusion of new circular business practices, in particular in the uptake of repair, reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing;
?	Increased resource efficiency along and across value chains, causing a measurable reduction in GHG emissions, release of microplastics, other environmental pollution, and in the use of hazardous substances, and an increase of carbon removals.
Scope: Predominantly consisting of SMEs, the EU furniture industry employs around one million European workers and manufactures approximately a quarter of the world?s furniture, representing a EUR 84 billion market equating to an EU28 consumption of ~10.5 million tons of furniture per annum. Despite a notable degree of knowledge and awareness of CE principles, analyses conducted in the framework of luxury furniture show that the involvement of furniture companies in CE practices, in particular those concerning reuse and recycle actions, is still marginal, and very limited use of process and product certifications has been noted.179 According to the findings of an EU-funded project180, furniture waste in the EU accounts for more than 4% of the total municipal solid waste stream. Waste arising from commercial sources is assumed to contribute 18% of total furniture waste generation across the sector. Total annual EU furniture waste equates to 10.78 million tonnes. According to European Federation of Furniture Manufacturers statistics, 80% to 90% of the EU furniture waste in MSW is incinerated or sent to landfill, with ~10% recycled. Reuse activity in the sector is considered low. Where reuse does occur, it is mostly through commercial second-hand shops, social enterprise companies or charities.
Six key cycles can be highlighted to make furniture more circular. All proposals should target several of these cycles:
?	Maintain ? using preventative maintenance to maximise product lifetime, e.g., a chair remains a chair;
?	Repair ? corrective maintenance, e.g., a chair remains a chair;
?	Reuse ? redistributing products through a change in ownership, e.g., a chair remains a chair;
?	Refurbish or remanufacture products to optimize lifetime, e.g., by resizing a desk or changing the appearance of a chair through re-upholstering to extend ?fashion? service life, or resizing desks;
?	Repurpose ? change functionality of the product, e.g., a desk becomes a table;
?	Recycle ? recovering the value of components and materials for feedstock as secondary materials in new products.
Key strategies to achieve the circularity transition are circular design including the smart use of biobased materials, a shift from products to services, extended product life through design, safe and circular material choices, increased material efficiency, and modular design. It is evident that circularity concepts must be anchored in the design phase of products and aim at the user. All proposals should therefore address to some extent circular design strategies.
Projects should demonstrate and deploy at large scale innovative solutions and designs for increased quality, non-toxicity and durability of secondary and renewable materials and increased share of secondary and renewable materials in new products. Projects should demonstrate increased recovery, recycling and upcycling rates and a higher uptake of secondary materials for high value applications. Projects should also demonstrate circular business practices, in particular in the uptake of repair and reuse, remanufacture, product-service-systems, and in the full lifetime of products or services. To achieve this, targeted market size, economic feasibility, cost efficiency and social acceptance need to be addressed. To break down the barriers for this transition, it is important that proposals involve and address the different perspectives of all relevant actors, e.g., manufacturers, retailers, consumers and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs). Proposals should consider the use of digital solutions (including technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and blockchain) in particular with a view to the implementation of the digital product passport, and demonstrate their benefits for increased circularity. They should also help produce harmonised and robust methods to assess the amount of recycled content in sectoral products, which is key for a future review of green claims through authorities and consumer organisations. Environmental, social and economic impacts should be assessed from a lifecycle perspective as product, organisation and consumption environmental footprints, using the respective methods developed by the European Commission (Product Environmental Footprint, PEF, should be used for the assessment of the environmental impacts) and through costing methods and a dynamic LCA; relevant data should be fed into the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment, following the specific Environmental Footprint data and format requirements. The functional performance of technologies and secondary materials can be assessed through the EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) scheme. Considering the microplastics and microfiber pollution and hazardous substances that are present in the targeted waste streams, their removal from the materials used for the products in concern as well as from the recovered material is crucial, in addition to applying less-polluting production and consumption procedures. Decontamination levels need to be properly addressed and accumulation prevented. Proposals should fully incorporate the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) approach. All results should be validated using quantitative indicators and targets wherever possible.
Proposals should also envisage policy recommendations for increased warranty and cascading use. They should also provide for the development of training material to endow workers in this occupational group with the right skillset in order to deploy the new technologies developed. Proposals should consider the development of learning resources for the current and future generations of employees, with the possibility to integrate them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes. The projects should provide contributions to relevant standards or best practices.
Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
To the extent that proposed solutions will address the role of the consumer, proposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission?s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). Joint activities with CCRI projects are encouraged.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CircBio-01-4, Systemic circular solutions for a sustainable tourism,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to the following Destination impacts: i) accelerate regional, rural, local/urban and consumer-based transitions, ii) enhance European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence, and iii) improve on consumer and citizen benefits.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Diffusion of circular tourism services, where the use of harmful substances and the generation of waste is minimised and the use of energy, land and water is efficient;
?	Deployment of replicable systemic solutions for cities and regions, where circularity is ingrained in the service design, whether for the use of residents or visitors, taking into account the specific needs of the territory (urban, rural, peripheral);
?	Increased circular, zero-pollution and climate-neutral practices among providers and users of tourism services and active participation of users in circular systemic solutions;
?	Deployment of innovative solutions and new, affordable technologies (including digital technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and blockchain) that support transformation towards circularity for all actors on different systemic levels;
?	Creation of jobs that facilitate circularity for different sectors, serving those who are living in or visiting cities and regions;
?	 Uptake, replication and visibility of circular systemic solutions for sustainable tourism that contributes economically, socially and environmentally to the achievement of the targets of the European Green Deal, circular economy action plan, bioeconomy strategy, industrial strategy and EU agenda for tourism, at local, regional, national and European levels.
Scope: Proposals are expected to implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions at the level of cities and regions, and include several sectors providing services for visitors and residents such as hospitality, transportation, culture, attractions, nature-based activities.
Tourism can consume large quantities of energy, water, and plastics, which degrade the environmental quality of destinations and ecosystems, affecting the lives of residents. Circular tourism should consider waste and water management, batteries and vehicles, electronics and ICT, packaging, plastics, construction and buildings, GHG emissions of local and long-distance mobility, accommodation and food services.
Proposals should address at least one of these above mentioned sectors.
The complexity of tourism ecosystem lies in the fact that industry is deeply interlinked with and dependent on multiple key resource and commodity chains. Travel and tourism actors can both act as enablers of circularity in a wider economic context, and at the same time benefit from circularity models in other industrial ecosystems. Proposals should develop and demonstrate new and circular business models and technological solutions to change the way tourism operates, enabling businesses and destinations to be sustainable. This includes developing systemic approaches that steer the behaviour of consumers, whether residents or citizens, towards circularity and makes them participate in circular practices.
The implemented circular systemic solutions should address economic, social and environmental dimensions of the transition towards circular tourism and include science, technology, behavioural and governance components. Proposals are expected to involve the relevant actors, which include public administrations, destination management organisations, private sector services and industries, citizens (residents and visitors), non-governmental organisations and new types of actors rising from collaborative economy platforms.
The development of systemic solutions needs to consider the costs of transition from the existing models into the new ones, analysing trade-offs and challenges related to their implementation and demonstration. As the tourism ecosystem is mostly composed of small actors, micro and SMEs, systemic solutions at the level of cities and regions should develop and test innovative and collaborative ways to create common objectives, targets and processes. The implementation of technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and blockchain could also be considered in a context-sensitive manner. Proposals should however also investigate simple, low-cost and low-tech solutions. Projects should analyse the encountered obstacles and drivers and provide clear and precise policy recommendations for local authorities on how to improve circular tourism. Each circular systemic solution should address social, economic and environmental externalities and contribute to the well-being of the local communities while improving the circularity behaviour of the visitors.
The circular systemic solutions implemented and their business models should demonstrate a high replicability and scalability potential in order to contribute to the overall transition of tourism towards more sustainable and resilient practices. During their implementation and by the end of their lifecycle, the selected proposals are expected to prepare and share clear and comprehensive guidelines on the circular systemic solutions adopted, including their strengths and weaknesses experienced, mainly for the use of economic operators in the sector.
With regard to the territorial aspects of all proposed solutions, proposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the European Commission?s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI). Joint activities with CCRI projects are encouraged.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CircBio-01-5," Programmed biodegradation capability of bio-based materials and products, validated in specific environments",2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Successful proposals will enable the bio-based industries in the Union to contribute to the enhancement of European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence and to the development of innovative and sustainable value-chains in the bio-based sectors. Projects results will contribute to deliver bio-based solutions with reduced environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, in line with the EGD objectives, the EU circular economy and the EU zero pollution action plans.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Circular design of bio-based technologies and products: decreasing environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, increasing durability and suitability of products to be safely re-used and re-manufactured, allowing for high-quality recycling and for biodegradability.
?	Innovative manufacturing processes to enable programming the safe biodegradation of bio-based materials and products according with the environmental conditions and time frame for specific applications.
?	Information and labelling of bio-based materials and products with biodegradability capacity for specific applications and end-of-life options.
Scope: The amount of waste littered in the open environment and causing pollution from harmful substances released from such waste streams, such as from plastic littering, has reached the level of a global emergency, especially affecting soil and water quality and biodiversity in land and marine environments. The overall low level of recycling of many waste streams, including collected plastic waste, is also part of such global pollution challenge. Biodegradability of materials and products for targeted applications may offer viable end-of-life solutions in case of safe and sustainable biodegradation either in open environments or under controlled conditions, i.e., in composting plants and anaerobic digestors.
To deliver biodegradable bio-based solutions that address the global pollution challenges effectively, proposals should:
?	Analyse those cases of uncontrolled waste littering in the open environment, particularly of plastic waste leading to pollution from nano- and micro-plastics and other contaminants released by macro-plastics, and the corresponding safe bio-based applications where biodegradation in open environments could enable safe and sustainable end-of-life options, e.g., in humanitarian contexts  where waste management systems for collection, sorting and recycling are not feasible.
?	Select applications for biodegradable non-single-use/single-use bio-based materials and products. Such applications should include materials and products which are biodegradable in open environments in those cases of uncontrolled waste littering, as treated in the previous point, and/or other items that may bring some environmental benefits from being biodegradable, for example in cases where products and materials are contaminated from food or from other organic substances during their use;
?	Develop manufacturing technologies of such bio-based materials and products with targeted performances: i) decreased carbon footprint (based on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and on the increase of carbon removals) and environmental impacts of the production processes; ii) improved circular life extension through predictive maintenance, suitability to be safely re-used and re-manufactured, allowing for recycling, and programmed integrity/biodegradation in specific environments, depending on the application, either in controlled environment (i.e. aerobic digestion in composting plants, anaerobic digestion producing biogas) and in open environments, including in extreme environments in terms of physical conditions; iii) safe biodegradation in the specific environments as in point ii), especially considering the eco-toxicity and any impacts on natural ecosystems from biodegraded materials and from their additives and other components;
?	Use innovative and adapt existing AI-based and other digital solutions to optimise the circular lifecycle of products and make it more environmentally and economically sustainable;
?	Validate tests of biodegradability of bio-based materials designed for specific applications both in controlled and in open environments, e.g., soil and water, under ranges of physical/chemical conditions including extreme conditions. The tests should include the monitoring of the time-frame of partial up to full biodegradation and the environmental impacts in case of biodegradation in open environments, including eco-toxicity and any impacts on biodiversity;
?	Provide insights into the development of information and labelling systems to inform users on the most appropriate applications and on the correct use and end-of-life disposal options for the materials and products within the scope. Transparent information should aim at improving the societal acceptance of bio-based innovation and at supporting consumers and customers in making responsible and informed choices. Information should include the assessment of the risks and environmental impacts, including on ecosystems, from an uncontrolled disposal and from littering into the open environments;
?	Assess the overall economic feasibility of the manufacturing of the materials and products within the scope.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU funded projects, including under the Circular Bio-based Europe JU, the Processes 4 for Planet partnership and other European partnerships of Horizon Europe.

?	Contribution to expanding the sustainable exploration of biodiversity hotspot regions, e.g., transitional waters, deep-sea, polar regions;
?	Advances in the development of the next generation of sampling methods, technologies, as well as understanding of the legal frameworks within which the development process operates;
?	Better preparedness to harvest aquatic bioactive substances in the most environmental friendly manner and support to green industrial bioprocessing with more sustainable bio-based products through bio discovery of novel sources and new biotechnology processes and applications;

?	Advancement in understanding the ecology of marine or other aquatic ecosystems, including possibly the ones on water surface, in sediments, in the internal cavity of sponges etc.;
?	Increased commitment to conserve and sustainably use the ocean?s genetic diversity and contribution to the understanding of potential trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of ocean, and other aquatic, biodiversity.
Scope: Extreme environments with huge bio-resources still present enormous challenges for exploration and sampling operations. Challenges are often due to the depth, pH, salinity, temperature and pressure conditions, which make exploration technically difficult, risky and expensive.
Proposals under this topic should explore marine or other aquatic ecosystems with complex and extreme conditions such as temperature, pressure, alkalinity or acidity/pH level, extremely low nutrients, etc. with focus on extremophilic organisms capable of thriving/surviving in such extreme environments (e.g., deep hydrothermal vents, hypersaline lagoons, sub-seafloor sediments). They should develop or optimise tailor-made sampling methods, explore the metabolic, physiological and other adaptation mechanisms to such extreme ecological conditions and look for novel and highly efficient metabolites, drugs, enzymes and chemicals for industrial application.
They should disseminate their results in the most efficient and transparent manner considering the risks and ethics related to science & technology in compliance with EU regulations on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation (ABS) in the EU.
Selected projects should collaborate with each other.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CircBio-02-1-two-stage," Circular solutions for textile value chains through innovative sorting, recycling, and design for recycling",2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 5.00-3,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to the following Destination impacts: i) enhance European industrial sustainability, competitiveness and resource independence, and ii) improve on consumer and citizen benefits.
Project results are expected to contribute to at least two of the following outcomes:
?	Roll-out of systemic solutions for textile sorting, using innovative digital technologies (such as AI, robotics, IoT and blockchain);
?	Roll-out of feasible solutions for facilitated disintegration to be incorporated in product design, as an enabler for recycling;
?	Increased uptake of mechanical recycling solutions that deliver competitive, high-quality secondary materials;
?	Roll-out of thermo-mechanical, chemical and other (e.g., enzymatic) recycling solutions that are sustainable from a zero-pollution, circular material and energy efficiency perspective.
Scope: The topic aims at improved management of the end-of-life phase of textile products. Proposals should address one or more of the following subjects and aim to combine them where relevant in a systemic way: facilitation of the disintegration of textile products through design, sorting, and recycling of textiles.
Textiles are the fourth highest-pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and water and fifth for GHG emissions and a major source of microplastic pollution in production and use phases. They are also a key material and product stream in the circular economy action plan. The purpose of this initiative is also to minimise the use of hazardous substances in processing and textile treatments. Proposals shall also demonstrate and deploy innovative solutions for increased quality, non-toxicity and durability of secondary textile materials and their processing and treatments.
Facilitation of the disintegration of textile products:
Beside the fibre composition affecting recyclability, textile products can also consist of various non-textile components or accessories, and can be coated, laminated or printed on. These hard parts, trims, coatings and laminated layers hamper recycling and are a major barrier for practically all textile fibre recycling technologies, especially chemical recycling technologies. The removal of these non-textile components requires disassembly prior to recycling, adding costs to the overall recycling process. Despite the various research projects on this topic, the implementation and uptake of these techniques is still far from reality. Proposals should address these challenges. New approaches should also be tested, involving technologies such as robotics and AI. Irrespective of the remaining technological and economical challenges, the implementation of disintegration techniques also requires a system, in which products that are fitted with any of these techniques are properly collected, recognised, and sent towards the right facility to apply the appropriate triggering mechanism.
Systemic solutions for sorting:
Over the coming years, the collected volumes of post-consumer textile waste are expected to increase by a further 65,000 to 90,000 tonnes per year due to the increased amounts of textiles placed on the market and the obligation to separately collect textile waste, which Member States have to put in place by 1 January 2025. This will further increase the need for advanced sorting for collecting organisations in order to create economic value out of this. At the moment, sorting is still mainly a manual process, having a significant contribution to the total process costs of recycled textile fibres. The cost of manual sorting is a major barrier to cost effective production of feedstock for textile fibre recycling. Automated sorting has the potential to deliver sufficient, well-defined and low-cost input to recycling processes, however, to date, this potential is not yet fulfilled. New technologies exist, but their limitations need to be addressed. Due to the limited penetration depth of NIR light, only the surface composition of textiles can be detected. RFID technology requires the textile products to carry an RFID tag and an entire system behind, adapted by all parts of the value chain. Therefore, proposals should develop systemic digital solutions that facilitate traceability and comprehensive exchange of information along the entire value chain, involving the use of technologies such as blockchain, AI and IoT. Proposals should build knowledge and competence regarding information system models, systems for data collection, provide an overview of existing standards and mapping of standardisation needs, include cost calculations and evaluation of Return On Investment (ROI), and consider implications of integrating digital information carriers in textile products.
Further development of textile recycling technologies:
In view of the huge amount of textile waste, which will have to be handled due to the soon mandatory separate collection, possible product requirements such as recycled content and the potential offered by different types of textile recycling, different ways of textile recycling remain relevant and will all be needed in the implementation of the textiles strategy. Mechanical recycling of textiles is an established technology in the market. However, the amount of spinnable fibre and the quality of the fibres should be improved. The integration of robotics, AI, or IoT components will play a role in the improvement of these processes. Thermo-mechanical recycling is a process that is still under development and further research is needed to improve the yield of recycled content and the use of chemicals to increase the quality of the polymer. Chemical and enzymatic recycling are novel technologies. Proposals should upscale polymer recycling of cotton via a pulping process and incorporate customer feedback for optimisation of the process and continuous delivery of suitable textile waste (in terms of purity and composition) as feedstock. Other options that can be explored are the recycling of polycotton blends and the monomer recycling of PET. The application of these technologies in research and innovation should also be extended to other types of fibres.
Clustering activities with projects under ?HORIZON-CL6-2024-CIRCBIO-01-2: Circular solutions for textile value chains based on extended producer responsibility? should be envisaged. A lifecycle perspective using LCA and LCC should be used when validating the technical and economic feasibility of the developed, improved, demonstrated and up-scaled processes. Proposals should also address the issue of side streams such as wastewater and the treatment and reuse. Novel value chain-based solutions through industrial symbiosis should be encouraged. For comparability reasons, LCAs should use well-established methods and be based on PEF wherever feasible. Proposals should fully incorporate the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) approach. Particular attention should also be given to the implementation of traceability solutions, also with a view to recent policy developments, e.g. the digital product passport. The participation of SMEs and industry is encouraged.

Proposal results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased deployment and demonstrated benefits of advanced digital solutions (e.g., through AI, robotics, IoT and blockchain) in circular businesses including waste management and recycling;
?	Emergence of new value chains using upcycled and/or recycled resources, e.g. through industrial symbiosis;
?	Increased upcycling and recycling rates for the targeted material streams;
?	Increased uptake of recycled material and upcycling to new higher-value products;
?	Increased resource efficiency along and across value chains, causing a measurable reduction in GHG emissions and other environmental pollution and an increase of carbon removals;
?	Increased diffusion of new circular business practices, in particular in the uptake of repair, reuse and remanufacturing, but also practices that form part of the sharing economy.
Scope: The new circular economy action plan (CEAP) highlights plastics as one of the four particularly important material and product streams with regard to their circularity potential and their environmental footprint. The circularity deficits for these streams are mainly due to the: lack of trust in secondary raw materials; lack of control over supply chains; lacking focus on material efficiency and design for circularity; unsustainable product lifetimes; lack of repair services; price gap between primary and secondary material; lack of secondary material markets; insufficient collection and sorting systems; insufficient and unpredictable input quality for recycling; insufficient information about quality and quantity of materials, including knowledge about possible microplastics pollution and substances of concern, lack of communication along the lifecycle between manufacturers and recyclers; lack of involvement and empowerment of citizens that would allow environmentally informed purchases.
Proposals should address the priorities set in the CEAP. Beside the continuous implementation of the EU plastics strategy, the CEAP has a strong focus on microplastics, but also calls for mandatory recycled content and the controlled use of bio-based, biodegradable plastics and alternative materials.
Proposals should demonstrate and deploy at large scale innovative solutions and designs for increased quality, non-toxicity and durability of secondary materials and increased share of secondary materials in new products. Proposals should demonstrate increased recovery, recycling and upcycling rates and a higher uptake of secondary materials for high value applications. Special attention should be given to the increased circularity of critical raw materials186. Proposals should also demonstrate circular business practices, in particular in the uptake of repair and reuse, remanufacture, product-service-systems, and in the full lifetime of products or services. To achieve this, targeted market size, economic feasibility, cost efficiency and social acceptance need to be addressed. To break down the barriers for this transition, it is important that proposals involve and address the different perspectives of all relevant actors, e.g., manufacturers, retailers, consumers and civil society organisations (CSOs). The projects should consider the use of digital solutions (including technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and blockchain) and demonstrate their benefits for increased circularity. Proposals should aim to implement traceability solutions in support of recent policy developments, e.g. regarding the digital product passport. Projects should also help produce harmonised and robust methods to assess the amount of recycled content in sectoral products, which is key for a future review of green claims through authorities and consumer organisations. Environmental, social and economic impacts should be assessed from a lifecycle perspective as product, organisation and consumption environmental footprints, using the respective methods developed by the European Commission (Product Environmental Footprint, PEF, should be used for the assessment of the environmental impacts) and through costing methods; relevant data should be fed into the European Platform on Life Cycle Assessment, following the specific Environmental Footprint data and format requirements. The functional performance of technologies and secondary materials can be assessed through the EU Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) scheme. All project results should be validated using quantitative indicators and targets wherever possible.
Projects should also develop training material to endow workers in this occupational group with the right skillset in order to deploy the new technologies developed. Proposals should consider the development of learning resources for the current and future generations of employees, with the possibility to integrate them in existing curricula and modules for undergraduate level and lifelong learning programmes. The projects should provide contributions to relevant standards or best practices.
Proposals should build on ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe and envisage clustering activities with these. Social innovation is recommended when the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.

Scope: The circular economy action plan (CEAP) highlights electronics including information and communications technology (ICT) equipment as one of the four particularly important material and product streams with regard to their circularity potential and their environmental footprint.

Proposals should address the priorities set in the CEAP, which states that ?electrical and electronic equipment continues to be one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU, with current annual growth rates of 2%. It is estimated that less than 40% of electronic waste is recycled in the EU. Value is lost when fully or partially functional products are discarded because they are not reparable.?

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CircBio-02-4-two-stage, New circular solutions and decentralised approaches for water and wastewater management,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 5.00-3,"Expected Outcome: In support of the European Green Deal and EU water-related policies, successful proposals will contribute achieving sustainable and circular management and use of water resources, as well as prevention and removal of pollution, in particular Destination ?Circular economy and bioeconomy sectors' impact ?Accelerate transitions towards a sustainable, regenerative, inclusive, just and clean circular economy based on enhanced knowledge and understanding of science?.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Demonstrate the benefits of decentralised approaches for water and wastewater treatment in various geographic, climate and economic conditions and create a decision framework to help policy makers to see where a decentralised approach can bring the most overall benefits with regards to the centralised one, as well as, how to better design their integration.
?	Improve co-design and co-creation processes and synergies between all relevant stakeholders and enhance public engagement to speed up the market uptake of decentralised and/or semi-decentralised solutions.
?	An enhanced systemic circular economy approach along the water, cycle by using process integration, to minimise water pollution, water consumption and the environmental footprint (including energy use) of water activities and ensure water security.
?	Support the implementation of relevant EU policy needs (e.g., water and marine related policies, water reuse regulation, climate change adaptation strategy, circular economy action plan, the EU zero pollution action plan, and chemical strategy for sustainability).
Scope: With a rapidly changing urban, peri-urban and rural environments, increasing flooding and contamination of water resources, and in order to reap the benefits of circular economy approaches, adapt to climate change and support the implementation of water supply and sanitation related SDG, innovative approaches and technologies are required. Such innovative approaches should go beyond the central objective of protecting human health and environment, by enabling the overall concept of circularity and sustainability in terms of economic feasibility, social equity and acceptance, technical and institutional applicability, environmental protection, and resource recovery.
Moreover, the current COVID19 pandemic highlighted the essential role of safely managed water supply, sanitation, and hygiene services for preventing disease and protecting human health during infectious disease outbreaks and constitutes a good opportunity to revisit strategies implemented so far, and to build a more sustainable society meeting basic needs such as water and sanitation for all.
Decentralised water and wastewater systems can play an important role in delivering such an innovative approach and has the potential for a sustainability transition of the water supply and sanitation sector, by treating wastewater close to its source. However, full and appropriate exploitation of these systems, requires further developments, in order to become economically affordable, ecologically sustainable and socially accepted. In addition, the integration between centralised and local, decentralised and/or semi-decentralised solutions should be further explored.
Actions in this topic should further develop efficient and sustainable decentralised and distributed approaches and technologies for climate-neutral and zero pollution water supply and wastewater treatment to optimise circular and sustainable use of natural resources, including integrated stormwater management systems to encourage water management on site rather than to the sewer. The impact of reduced sewer flows, more concentrated sewage and waste sludge discharges from decentralised systems on sewer infrastructure should be better assessed. A thorough comparison of the overall environmental and economic performance of ongoing decentralized water and wastewater systems in different geographical and climate conditions and their potential for climate mitigation and adaptation should be undertaken, in order to assess under which conditions decentralised systems perform better than the centralised ones and help to create the right enabling environment to overcome various regulatory and technological barriers related to the implementation of these approaches. New urban sanitation models based on decentralised and integrated approaches which consider municipal organic waste and wastewater as source for recovery and recycling materials such as organic matter and nutrients that are included in the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and wastewater streams, could be also considered.
The integration of decentralised and centralised systems for water supply and sanitation is particularly needed in highly urbanised areas where centralised systems are currently used, to provide better water services, by reconciling, for instance, the need to meet an increasing water demand and new quality standards in an economic and sustainable manner, including energy efficiency and production. In this context, this action should:
?	Develop an overarching risk analysis and optimization framework for the integrated design and operation of multiple source water supply systems, enhancing the application of digital technologies and solutions.
?	Demonstrate the potential of the integration of decentralised with centralised systems for water supply and sanitation in different areas and scales (eg. district level, cities, river basin), to assess the potential benefits/drawbacks, strengthening public participation and engagement and public private partnerships.
?	Address potential regulatory, financial and socioeconomic bottlenecks with a view of promoting long-term performance-based business models in public private partnerships for decentralised and/or integrated decentralised and centralised systems.
This action should bring together relevant researchers, technology providers, water utilities, business representatives, investors, policy makers and other water users and citizens. The active participation and engagement of different stakeholders should span the entire project development and implementation to ensure performance and sustainability and maximise the final impact.
To reinforce the potential benefits of implementing these decentralised approaches to policy makers their social impact, notably in terms of employment generation and population settlement in decentralised territories should be demonstrated.
The inclusion of relevant SSH expertise would be also needed to ensure the proposed solutions are also socially accepted.
Decentralised approaches for water and wastewater systems provides significant opportunities for developing countries and emerging economies to establish new alternatives and more sustainable approaches to water supply and sanitation and support the implementation of related SDGs. International cooperation is therefore strongly encouraged",

Projects results will contribute to deliver bio-based solutions with reduced environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, in line with the EGD objectives, the EU circular economy and the EU zero pollution action plans, the bioeconomy strategy and the communication on sustainable carbon cycles.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Circular design of bio-based processes and products: increasing resources and energy efficiency of bio-based technologies, decreasing their environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, improving durability and suitability of bio-based products to be safely re-used and re-manufactured, allowing for high-quality recycling, increasing the safe recycled content in new products;
?	Product information systems enabling the circularity, safety and environmental sustainability of the bio-based manufacturing sectors and of the use of products at consumers? level.
Scope: The bio-based processes and products within the scope of this topic do not include food, feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural and recreation sectors. The establishment of safe, resilient, competitive and equitable production and consumption systems with reduced environmental impacts on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate, is part of the objectives of the EU circular economy.
To improve the capacity of the industrial bio-based sectors within the scope of the topic, especially the manufacturing sectors, to contributing to that objective, proposals should:
?	Develop optimized design of bio-based processes and bio-based products to improve their circularity, taking into account the opportunity to re-use recycled materials in the local market. This could be achieved through increasing resources and energy efficiency of processes, improving high-quality recycling technologies, increasing the durability of products and their suitability to be safely re-used and re-manufactured, improved products end-of-life options, increasing the safe recycled content in new products, etc.;
?	Assess the safety, environmental sustainability and climate neutrality of circular bio-based processes and products along their value chains, including of the biological feedstock from land and sea used in the production processes. The environmental impacts of processes and products on soil, water, and air quality, biodiversity and climate should be based on existing and validated assessment methods, also developed and improved in past and ongoing R&I projects . In particular, the climate neutrality should be assessed based both on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and on the increase of carbon removals and should include an assessment of the energy efficiency improvement;
?	Include the assessment of economic and social aspects of the improved production and consumption bio-based systems in terms of increased economic value along the whole value chains, circular patterns of products involving consumers, i.e., durability, reuse, repair, remanufacturing and recycling patterns, improved economic value of recycled materials, job opportunities, etc.;
?	Develop product information systems demonstrating the safe and sustainable use of biological resources and the resource efficiency along value chains, from the production to the extended circular product lifetimes and appropriate disposal. Transparent information should aim at improving the societal acceptance of bio-based innovation and at supporting consumers and customers in making responsible and informed choices.
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and in line with the EU strategy for international cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation is encouraged. Projects are expected to contribute to the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative by interacting with the NEB Community, NEB Lab and other relevant actions of the NEB initiative through sharing information, best practice, and, where relevant, results.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU funded projects, including under the Circular Bio-based Europe JU, the Processes 4 Planet partnership and other European partnerships of Horizon Europe.

?	Advanced understanding and prediction of the impacts to water availability and quality of climate change affecting agricultural water consumption patterns, to protect surface water and groundwater quality against harmful impacts of climate change.
?	Solutions, pathways and strategies for risk assessment, mitigation and adaptation to agricultural (irrigation) practices in the event of extreme weather pressures (flooding, drought), which consider technical (such as land features/soil types) and socio-economic parameters.
Scope: Water availability (including permitting, measuring volumes and pricing) and quality is one of the most pressing issues, affecting human health, limiting food production, limiting ecological services, and hindering economic growth.
Extreme climatic events (notably droughts) are leading to increased water stress, affecting the water needs for agriculture and other uses. At the same time, water availability is itself impacted by climate change and this resource is becoming scarce in many places in the EU. The repartition of water to the users is becoming challenging. Agriculture is currently accounting to around one fourth of the total water extraction in the EU,  which is leading to tensions and in some cases to conflicts, in particular where illegal abstraction takes place. It is therefore crucial to prepare agriculture to adapt to a new context where water in agriculture is more sustainably and efficiently used, without compromising the water availability for other users or undermining the good status of waterbodies.
Proposals should address the following:
?	Produce tools and techniques to support farmers, special planners, policy makers and water managers with scientific and practical knowledge, including advice on appropriated price incentives and water management assistance, optimising agricultural water use, not only water for irrigation but also water used by local people and in other economic sectors, for the benefit of a healthy environment.
?	Develop or improve with new scientific knowledge and practice the methodology for monitoring and prediction of water quality and quantity requirements for agricultural use, based on information provided by Earth Observation systems and in situ measurements, using digital technologies such as smart (bio)sensors  and artificial intelligence (AI), as well as DNA-based indicators, that integrate monitoring and modelling tools to support decisions in relation to water management.
?	Assess and propose relevant adaptation of water infrastructures for irrigation, agricultural practices and land use. Consider nature-based solutions and latest technologies to address emerging needs and challenges like floods, droughts and/or salinization. Proposed measures should increase the resilience of agriculture by lowering the need for irrigation, reducing at the same time the environmental impact associated with irrigation in agriculture (e.g. salinisation and concentration of nutrients and pollutants) and therefore enhancing ecosystem protection and biodiversity preservation.
?	Develop scientific and practice advice to reduce water losses in agricultural activities while considering farmer?s water security and quality challenges.
?	Technologies to support a significant reduction of the presence of pesticide residues and nutrients in water bodies to levels that are no longer harmful.
Proposals should earmark the necessary resources for cooperation and networking activities. Activities should build upon and link with the work done under relevant Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects including as part of the Horizon 2020 art. 185 PRIMA partnership. Collaboration with the European partnership Water4all ? Water security for the Planet should be explored, as needed",

They should analyse the impacts and risks of the contaminants of emerging concern on marine ecosystems and marine biodiversity and provide basis for an integrated assessment and monitoring of the pathways of these contaminants in the marine environment. This will contribute in particular to the implementation of EU zero pollution action plan for air, water and soil and of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following outcomes:
?	Filled gaps in knowledge about the impacts and risks of contaminants of emerging concern (e.g. pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, biocides, micro and nano plastics) on marine ecosystems, including in marine sediments and on deep-sea ecosystems and on marine biota and on marine biodiversity, and including in relation to climate change mitigation and adaptation;
?	Provided advanced understanding of possible interactions between the changing marine environment (e.g. increased temperatures, changes in salinity and pH, etc.) due to changes in the climate system and contaminants of emerging concern in the marine environment, including marine sediments and impacts on marine ecosystems and marine biota and biodiversity;
?	Designed and tested solutions for integrated assessment, monitoring, modelling and forecasting of the circulation and impacts of contaminants of emerging concern in marine environment (including marine sediments and taking into account the climate change dimension ?both mitigation and adaptation-), ecosystems and on marine biota, including establishing testing methods, effect-based monitoring protocols and ensuring sustained collection and sharing of data under FAIR principles;
?	Build on, and widen, the data availability in European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud ;
Developed tools and guidance to support the implementation of relevant EU policies (e.g., Water Framework Directive, EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and EU zero pollution action plan for air, water and soil, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030).
Scope: Contaminants of emerging concern including pharmaceutical products, endocrine disruptors and contaminants found in personal care products, including micro plastics and nano plastics, are increasingly detected in surface and marine waters, as well as in marine sediments. There are concerns about the impact of these contaminants on the marine environment, ecosystems and biodiversity as some of these substances exhibit impacts on aquatic organisms at very low concentrations, in particular on their reproduction and development. There are also concerns about the accumulation of these contaminants in different parts of the marine environment, including sediments and deep sea marine ecosystems and biota.
Also, changes in the marine environment driven by the changing climate system (such as increases in water temperature, changes in salinity and in pH levels, increase in invasive species, etc.) may further influence the possible impacts of the contaminants of emerging concerns on the marine environment, ecosystems and biota.
The projects are expected to develop and test integrated assessment and effect-based monitoring of impacts of contaminants of emerging concern on marine environment, ecosystems and biodiversity, including testing methods that are aligned with the relevant OECD guidance , and where relevant develop new contaminant thresholds. The projects are expected to adopt an integrated and systemic approach to the assessment of impacts, including not only impacts on marine biota but also the circulation, accumulation, magnification, persistence and degradation of the contaminants of emerging concern in marine environment and ecosystems (including marine sediments and deep-sea ecosystems) and their interaction with the changing marine environment. Projects should contribute to the improvement of understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of contaminants of emerging concern in marine environment and should close knowledge gaps as regards the characteristics, occurrence and impacts of those contaminants on marine environment and marine biodiversity. The projects should furthermore contribute to the understanding of impacts of contaminants of emerging concern on marine biota and on marine biodiversity and provide basis for the design of effective future measures for the protection of marine biodiversity from the impacts of such contaminants.
The projects should recommend best practices in monitoring of the circulation of these contaminants in the marine environment and for the measurement of their impacts and risks, for their possible future integration into EU pollution monitoring and assessment systems, in particular under the Water Framework Directive, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU zero pollution action plan and for the implementation of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-3, Tackling human and climate change induced pollution in the Arctic - building resilient socio-ecological systems,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal?s zero pollution ambition, successful proposals should contribute to protecting Arctic ecosystems. They should analyse main pollution sources in a climate change context, and examine ways to prevent or eliminate pollutants, consequently protecting environmental and human health and the quality of aquatic ecosystems. This will contribute to the implementation of the new EU policy for a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic, to the follow-up of the 3rd Arctic Science ministerial meeting and to the work of the Arctic Council.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Advanced scientific understanding of the impacts of pollution in the Arctic, including marine litter, emerging pollutants and plastic pollution, as well as diverse chemical discharges, and its interactions with the changing climate and thawing permafrost;
?	Advanced understanding of the main ecological, socio-economic and health associated risks and challenges, following a One Health approach ;
?	Resilience and adaptation strategies identified for both ecosystems and human communities, in relation to the changes in Arctic. Design solutions and pathways for ecological and societal mitigation and adaptation;
?	Contribute to making the case for the designation and, if applicable, contribute to the establishment management plans of MPAs in international Arctic waters.
?	Assessment and monitoring tools developed for pollution impacts, using participatory approaches, citizen science and involving local and indigenous communities;
?	Contribute to the implementation of the EU policy for the Arctic and the follow-up of the 3rd Arctic Science Ministerial meeting.
Scope: Main environmental concerns in the Arctic stem from the loss of pristine environment and unique ecosystems. On one hand, ice melting allows for more people and economic activities to enter the area, and on the other hand, transboundary pollution brings into the Arctic contaminants whose sources are thousands of kilometres away.
Arctic economic development is associated with a high risk of air and marine pollution, particularly from oil spills, local mining, Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP), heavy metals, radioactive substances, marine litter and plastics. Pollution from Arctic shipping and tourism relying on heavy diesel fuels induce greater ice melting pack and have negative effects on marine life. Pollutants from local and distant sources are taken up by organisms and incorporated into polar food webs, jeopardizing human and environmental health.
Another threat to the Arctic environment is the growing prevalence of marine litter, and specifically plastic pollution. High concentrations of microplastic particles have been detected in Arctic ice, with a good deal of it suspected to have originated outside of the region.
Moreover, the share of MPA coverage in Arctic water (see for example the OSPAR Convention area) is particularly low.
Thawing permafrost brings in additional risks for pollution, from releasing pathogens to infrastructure degradation and failure. Combined, these drivers create a mosaic of multiple and mutually reinforcing anthropogenic stressors acting on the unique and highly vulnerable Arctic ecosystem.
Proposals should aim at developing innovative approaches to address only one of the following options:
?	Area A: Local and transboundary Pollutants in the Arctic ? risks and challenges in a One Health approach
Actions are expected to identify, assess, and analyse major impacts and risks of remote and local sources of pollution on the health, well-being and food security of Arctic societies and ecosystems and beyond, and propose adaptation and resilience strategies.
Actions should improve the understanding of the interactions between the changing climate system, changes in biological diversity and pollutant levels, including climate-driven ecosystem changes that are affecting natural emissions, such as wetlands (CH4), wildfires (CO2, black carbon), pollutant deposition or transfer and bioaccumulation in marine systems. They should analyse the cultural, socio?economic and health impacts on residents of the Arctic, their livelihood and food security, as well as adverse effects on the marine and terrestrial biodiversity of the region. They are expected to contribute to a better understanding of long-distance transport of marine plastic litter in the Arctic and air transport of micro plastics, as well to the dynamics between melting ice and increasing discharges of, for example, mercury in the marine ecosystem, and their impact on ecosystems and food safety.
?	Area B: Pollution and health risks linked to permafrost thaw
Rising temperatures induce thawing of permafrost, bringing an extra layer of complexity for assessing pollution and health risks in the Arctic environments. Greenhouse gases released from thawing permafrost threaten to cause irreversible changes in the Arctic and other regions. Thawing permafrost causes change in mechanical properties of soils, which in turn deteriorates stability and service-life of built infrastructure and increases coastal erosion.
Actions should address and analyse the adverse effects and pollution risks linked to permafrost thaw, infrastructure degradation and failure, and other associated risks for the environment and human health and well-being. Actions will focus on an improved quantification of these effects, as well as emerging contaminants and re-emission of legacy contaminants due to melting cryosphere or thawing permafrost.
Actions are expected to improve the understanding of the impacts of permafrost thaw on the health of humans, plants, animals, and wider environment, in a One Health approach, including critical infrastructure, water and food security aspects, and wider socio-economic, demographic and cultural impact.
Proposals should assess the impact, trends and new scenarios on ecosystem services, including exploring ecosystems management techniques with special attention to community or nature-based solutions. Potential measures should focus on developing community-oriented decision support systems, and co-design mitigation and adaptation measures.
For both options, proposals should focus on an improved quantification of these effects and explore pathways to minimise risks and should be linked with state-of-the-art climate change predictions coupled with socio-economic models; assess the ecosystems' responses to risk factors and how these responses are affecting the well-being of indigenous populations and local communities but also health of the environment, in a One Health approach; identify adaptation and mitigation strategies, aiming at building resilient Arctic socio-ecological systems.
Proposals are expected to adopt a system thinking or transdisciplinary approach, with simultaneous analysis of environmental, societal, climatic and biodiversity impacts, their relationships and interlinkages, and positive and negative feedbacks. The participation of technical sciences, social sciences and humanities disciplines is important for addressing the complex challenges of this topic, as well as engaging local communities in the research process, as appropriate.
International cooperation is encouraged, with a strong linkage with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance and encouraging participation from countries that take part in the Arctic Science Ministerial meetings.
Actions under this topic should plan on a close collaboration among each other and with the EU Polar Cluster. Actions should build upon and link with past Horizon 2020 projects (e.g., Nunataryuk and Arctic PASSION), EU Polarnet 2, Copernicus, Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON).

HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-4, Environmental sustainability and circularity criteria for industrial bio-based systems,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Successful proposals will support bio-based industries, traders and researchers and innovators, to assess and trace the environmental impacts and circularity of industrial bio-based systems in order to enable responsible production and to steer innovation in the industrial bio-based systems in the EU. Project outcomes will contribute to enhancing circular bio-based systems to operate according to planetary boundaries, replacing fossil-based systems and their carbon footprint, mitigating climate change, restoring biodiversity and protecting air, water and soil quality along supply chain of biological feedstock and industrial value chains, in line with the 2030 climate target plan, the EU zero pollution action plan and the communication on sustainable carbon cycles.
Projects results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome:
?	Standardisation of methods assessing the environmental impacts on soil, water and air quality, biodiversity and climate, and the circularity along the value chains of bio-based products for international trade at EU and global scale.
?	Methods to assess the environmental sustainability and the circularity of low TRL bio-based technologies.
?	Orientations for research and innovation programmes in the bio-based sectors.
Scope: The environmental sustainability and circularity assessment of industrial bio-based systems is instrumental to guarantee and monitor that they are developed in a way they can contribute to the just green transition of the EU economy away from a linear fossil-based system. On one hand, the method for such assessment, applied to high TRL bio-based solutions, would represent an instrument for policy makers and for investors, to support the deployment of and to leverage investments in the best performing bio-based sectors. On the other hand, the assessment of the environmental sustainability and circularity of low TRL, cutting-edge bio-based technologies is important to understand the potential of emerging technologies to contribute to the just green transition, also compared to the more mature technologies. Such knowledge would have an impact on the programming of R&I support initiatives, to save resources and move faster towards the scaling-up of the most promising bio-based technologies, including focussing on the potential environmental hotspots of the emerging technologies.
The assessment of the environmental sustainability and circularity should benefit to the greatest extent possible from existing methodologies and indicators, which can be adapted if needed. Methods and indicators should use the available environmental observations efficiently.
To deliver on the expected outcome, proposals should:
?	Identify the range of high TRL industrial bio-based systems in the Union to be analysed in the project. Industrial bio-based systems within the scope of this topic do not include food, feed, biofuels, bioenergy and cultural and recreation sectors;
?	Improve existing and/or develop new methods to assess environmental impacts of the selected industrial bio-based systems on climate, biodiversity, land use and water resources as priorities, but also on soil, water and air quality. Assessments should consider the life cycle perspective. The impact on climate should include the both the greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon removal potential of bio-based systems. The analysis should include trade-offs, for example between direct and indirect land use and land use change impacts and the carbon storage and substitution effect of bio-based products and provide an overall assessment of the environmental sustainability of the systems within the scope;
?	Improve existing and/or develop new metrics of circularity of industrial bio-based systems based on the application of the cascading approach of biomass use, the resources efficiency, and effectiveness on a life-cycle perspective (i.e. durability, reuse, repair, remanufacturing and recycling patterns of bio-based products), other circular aspects;
?	Analyse trade-offs and synergies with economic and social objectives (including geographical distribution aspects, urbanization pressures, etc.) and with competing and adjacent economy sectors in the bioeconomy (e.g. food and feed, biofuels and bioenergy) as well as with the fossil-based industrial systems;
?	Collect and analyse the (range of) best available industrial bio-based systems within the Union in terms of environmental and circular performances, to build a set of benchmarks or references with best performances for similar industrial systems;
?	Include the environmental sustainability and circularity of bio-based products, as assessed through the methods developed under the project, in existing certification scheme at EU and global scale, to enable international trade of certified sustainable bio-based products;
?	Consult stakeholders on the applicability of proposed certification schemes, also to improve the societal readiness adaptation in terms of acceptability and uptake of innovations by society;
?	Develop and disseminate guidelines for targeted stakeholders on the assessment methods and the enhanced certification schemes developed in the project;
?	Perform a preliminary analysis and improvement of the methods for the assessment of environmental sustainability and circularity performances of bio-based supply and value chains adapted to very low TRL bio-based technologies through: i) a review of the ?prospective? LCA approaches and applications to bio-based and fossil-based technologies, with a focus on the environmental sustainability and circularity assessment approaches and tools. This task would lead to improve understanding and classifying the main challenges of prospective LCAs, e.g., comparability of results, input data availability, uncertainties/robustness, etc.; ii) the adaptation of the ?prospective? LCA approaches to very low TRL bio-based technologies, including via modelling approach; iii) modelling the tests to validate the developed methods on a range of low TRL technologies and processes, including in relevant environments for future R&I projects; iv) including the analysis of potential synergies and trade-offs with economic and social objectives;
?	Develop and disseminate guidelines to targeted stakeholders on the assessment of environmental sustainability and circularity performances of bio-based supply and value chains adapted to very low TRL bio-based technologies.
Consortia of applicants should involve LCA experts and researchers in the bio-based technologies, bio-based industries, trade bodies, consumers? organisations and any relevant stakeholder along the value chain of industrial bio-based systems.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past  and ongoing EU funded projects, including under the Circular Bio-based Europe JU  and other partnerships of Horizon Europe.

Approaches based on improved enzymatic solutions should carefully consider a parallel topic , to avoid overlaps, and create synergies.
?	Environmental improvements, especially reduced pollution/toxicity and lowered impacts should be verified and demonstrated by established methodology of life cycle assessment, and the monitoring approaches throughout the project need to be clearly established.
?	Production of biofuels and bioenergy is excluded from scope, to avoid overlaps with Horizon Europe Cluster 5. Health applications need to be carefully considered to avoid possible overlaps with activities supported under Horizon Europe Cluster 1.
?	Clear communication and dissemination activities are an essential element, including awareness raising, engagement of societal actors (NGOs, consumer organisations, professional organisations).

Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Improving the quality of environment (water, soil and air) by stepping up the reliable monitoring and detection, of any biotic or abiotic pollutants, by developing practical, specific, adaptable and economic tools, based on bio-based principles, for the use of consumers, inspection services and industry operators alike. This can cover the use at industrial locations, but also at ecological disaster- or accidents? sites, or at home applications;
?	Contributing to the zero-pollution objective of the European Green Deal and to the European Missions such as one on ?Restoring our ocean and waters by 2030? or ?A Soil Deal for Europe? by up-scaling the application of modern biosensors underpinned by the biotechnology, across a variety of ecosystems, including marine and freshwater or soil ecosystems and real-life conditions impacted by the pollution issues;

HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-7, Strategies to prevent and reduce plastic packaging pollution from the food system,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: To support the implementation of the European Green Deal, the new circular economy action plan, the EU 2030 climate target plan, the farm to fork strategy, the food 2030 initiative and the Mission ?Restore our ocean and waters by 2030?, successful proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased knowledge on the impacts of littered plastic food packaging on the terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments and ecosystems, including the climate change mitigation and adaptation dimensions;
?	Uptake of innovative business strategies, design and production models to prevent and reduce the use of plastic food packaging;
?	Adoption of increasingly sustainable, effective and efficient fit-for-purpose packaging solutions by food operators, and reduction of the dependency on fossil-based materials, thus contributing to EU climate action;
?	Increased reuse and recycling of sustainable packaging;
?	Increased consumer acceptance of sustainable, efficient and fit-for-purpose food packaging solutions including where appropriate the non-use of any type of packaging;
?	Support to the implementation of the relevant targets as outlined in the revised packaging and packaging waste directive and the directive on single-use plastics and support to operators, especially SMEs, in meeting the requirements of the relevant EU legislation.
Scope: The use of single-use plastics in food packaging has grown significantly in the last decades, leading to increased pollution in the environment and greenhouse gas emissions. While plastic packaging is an enabler for the safety and shelf life of food products, contributing to the reduction of food waste, there is a need for improved solutions that promote the prevention and reduction of excessive packaging in the food industry. Often, the excessive food packaging results in its inappropriate disposal or littering by consumers. This can be reduced through the application of circular models for design and production and the proper disposal and recycling of packaging waste.
Proposals are expected to:
?	Provide a comprehensive and evidenced based analysis of the negative impacts and externalities of littered plastic food packaging in the different terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments and ecosystems across Europe. This analysis should provide reliable quantitative new data and fill in existing data gaps on these negative impacts and externalities through multiple sources, including citizen science tools.
?	Provide an analysis of the main challenges and existing good practices of prevention and reduction of single use plastics, aiming at shifting the current packaging design and production practices. This analysis should address the availability of sustainable and innovative alternatives as well as the readiness of food packaging producers and food business operators to adopt such solutions.
?	Develop innovative business strategies, design and production models that improve the prevention, reduction and reuse of plastic food packaging, whilst ensuring that they can be easily implemented in European countries. These business strategies and models should involve all relevant actors, including food SMEs and, when appropriate, policy makers. They should consider health and environmental impacts  of packaging, guaranteeing they do not cause any contamination of food and the environment by hazardous chemicals. Moreover, they should maintain the microbiological and chemical safety and quality of food, taking into account relevant parameters such as their contact with aqueous and fatty foods, aging, and effect on shelf life.
?	Develop innovative strategies, design and production models to facilitate packaging recycling, linking developers of sustainable packaging with converters and recyclers, taking into account the recycling capacity technologies and the relevant technical specifications of the use of recycled content. These strategies should namely target collection systems, the use of mono-materials, the reduction of labelling materials and the promotion of easy to sort and clean materials.
?	Develop strategies aimed at improving consumer acceptance of sustainable, efficient and fit-for-purpose packaging solutions, facilitating the use of reusable and recyclable packaging for consumers, easing the sorting and appropriate disposal of packaging, and helping them to correctly interpret labelling of packaging. These strategies should be designed based on a joint effort of developers of sustainable packaging and consumers and should aim at avoiding confusion, minimising misuse, increasing user convenience and encouraging a greater uptake of such packaging solutions.
?	Implement multi-actor approach by involving a wide range of food packaging actors and consumers and conducting inter-disciplinary research.
?	Support social innovation for inclusive and long-term solutions aiming at the reduction of plastic food packaging.
The proposals may:
?	build links with the European Mission ?Restore our ocean and waters by 2030?, in particular with the Mission activities under objective 2 ? prevent and eliminate pollution in our ocean, seas and water, and with the Mission lighthouse activities in the Mediterranean Sea basin focusing on preventing, minimising, remediating and monitoring pollution;
?	build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system;
?	build links and support the Mission?s knowledge and information system (Digital Twin Ocean), in particular by contributing to pollution monitoring, modelling, and knowledge creation and data.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-ZEROPOLLUTION-02-1-two-stage, Optimisation of manure use along the management chain to mitigate GHG emissions and minimize nutrients/contaminants dispersion in the environment,3/28/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,26-Sep-23,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the farm to fork strategy, the methane strategy, the EU zero pollution action plan and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the successful proposal will support research and innovation (R&I) to help farm business reduce local and global GHG and ammonia emissions from livestock farming systems. It will contribute to support policy makers with enhanced knowledge to limit emissions and investigate further measures, inter alia under the common agricultural policy, to achieve reduction targets of 2030 and beyond.
The proposed project is expected to contribute to the reduction of the environmental and climate footprint of the livestock farming systems, through a better understanding of i) the potential of scaling up efficient and innovative manure management practices and technologies, and ii) the impact of emission abatement and contaminant reduction measures on health and environment (air, water and soil) safety.
Activities under this topic will contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Improved cost-effective solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and atmospheric, air, water and environment pollutants produced by the livestock manure management chain, both in conventional and organic livestock farming
?	Boosted uptake of improved and innovative practices and technologies to optimise manure management (while considering potential trade-offs)
?	Improved capacity to better manage manure nutrients, minimizing their losses, increasing circularity and matching demand and supply
?	Policy recommendation on improving manure management to mitigate GHG and ammonia emissions and minimize dispersion of undesirable manure components such as biological and chemical contaminants in the environment.
Scope: Agriculture is a sector that significantly contributes to GHG emissions in EU and to air pollution, mainly through ammonia emissions. Reducing the environmental and climate footprint of the livestock farming system is therefore of paramount importance. Several practices and technical measures to limit emissions from manure management are already available. Some other techniques are still considered experimental. Despite major advancements, there is still no widespread application of these practices and further research is needed to assess their socio-economic and environmental impacts. Furthermore, there is the need to do a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies along the entire manure management chain and to take into account different GHGs and the pollution swapping effect, i.e. decreasing the emission of one GHG that can cause the increase of another one or the increase of the emission of the same GHG at one of the other stages of manure management.
Another important aspect of manure management is to reduce environmental pollution caused among others by ammonia emissions, excess of nitrogen and phosphorus, by nitrate leakages, and by different components of manure, including potential contaminants, on air and water quality, on soil health, on animal health, welfare and productivity and on human health.
Therefore, there is the need to develop further strategies and technologies for livestock farming systems to reduce GHG, ammonia and nitrate emissions from manure through an integrated approach for the management of manure, taking into account all steps: feeding, housing, handling, collection, treatment, storage and application. The following elements should be incorporated:
?	Identify and establish inventory of up-to-date manure management practices, technologies and data originating from R&I activities (from feeding to low-emission manure storage and processing, composting, exchange of manure/slurries between livestock and crop farms, manure additives to reduce emissions, etc.) in conventional/intensive, semi-intensive, household and organic livestock farming systems;
?	Improve or develop lifecycle assessment methods, models and equipment for the measurement and monitoring of GHG (CH4, N2O), atmospheric and air pollutants (NH3, NOx) at each stage of manure management practices, from feeding to field application;
?	Improve knowledge on the fate and persistence in the environment (e.g., water, soil, air) of manure chemicals and biological contaminants, including pathogens antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and associated health/environmental risks;
?	Demonstrate and test the most efficient strategies and technologies to mitigate GHG emissions and air pollutants from manure at regional/local scale. Activities should take into account relevant practices, strategies and data on GHG, atmospheric and air pollutants mitigation from several livestock farming systems, covering conventional/intensive, semi-intensive, grazing/low input or organic, in different climate/biogeographical regions;
?	Cost-benefit assessment of practices/technologies used to mitigate GHG emissions, air pollutants and nitrate emissions from manure, including assessment of pollution swapping effects, trade-offs and co-benefits on animal (e.g., health and welfare, production efficiencies) and environment (e.g., ammonia emissions, nitrate leakage, nitrogen balance and P losses to water);
?	Formulate technical guidelines and policy recommendation to enhance the implementation and uptake of methods, technologies or practices to limit emissions and contaminants from manure management.
The proposal should take into account other EU-funded projects, including those funded under the ERA-NETs SusAn  and ERA-GAS . Proposals should be based on a gap analysis taking into account the existing legislation  and related knowledge.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach? and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector, agricultural advisory services, manufacturers, ecology and nature conservation experts, and other relevant actors.

?	Demonstrated environmental, economic and behavioural effects of aforementioned N/P limiting solutions while promoting local and regional sustainability and circular economy schemes;
?	Comprehensive guidance on sustainable and circular practices to control regional N/P flows at regional level in the EU, and recommendations to relevant actors (policymakers, local administrations, practitioners, industries etc.).
Scope: Building on recent innovations in regional N/P budgeting and quantification methodologies to ensure good status for air, water and soil ecosystems, this Innovation Action should demonstrate how to apply optimised N/P budgets, based on maximum allowable inputs of N/P at a regional/river basin scale, and create the necessary systemic and multi-actor transition pathways to ensure a sustainable integrated N/P management in the future. The aim is to show how N/P-relevant sectors (e.g., agriculture, aquaculture, forestry, industrial sectors, food/drink sector, water supply, water/waste management, bioenergy, fossil-based energy production, mining activities, transport, unintentional losses through leaching and run-off of agricultural nutrients etc.) in a given region can limit N/P emissions to air, water and soil from their activities by respecting pre-established regional N/P budgets and applying N/P balancing practices. N/P-balancing practices comprise activities that enhance the sustainability and circularity of N/P relevant resources and services between urban/industrial and rural/coastal environments and apply respective governance measures. Finally, it will be essential to develop comprehensive guidelines to disseminate best practices and techniques to all involved actors.
Proposals should:
?	Implement a reliable N/P budgeting methodology to identify the maximum allowable input of N/P at regional/river basin scale and ensure good status for air, water and soil ecosystems. N/P budgets should stay within safe ecological and regional boundaries, i.e. by respecting limit values of N/P in air, water and soil, as specified in existing EU legislation  or based on recent scientific evidence  and complying with the precautionary principle.
?	Demonstrate single or integrated region-specific practices in all relevant N/P sectors that help balance emissions from N and P-based fertilisers in agriculture, enhance soil health, reduce eutrophication and water pollution and limit harmful emissions to air.
?

HORIZON-CL6-2024-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-3, Environmental impacts of food systems,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The food sector contributes to food security but is also responsible for air, water and soil pollution. It can contribute to biodiversity loss, soil erosion and climate change, and it consumes excessive amounts of natural resources, including water and energy, while a significant amount of food is wasted. In supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU zero pollution action plan, the farm to fork strategy, the European climate pact, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy and the Food 2030 initiative, the successful proposal should address all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased overall knowledge of the environmental and climate impacts stemming from the food systems, including potential trade-offs/synergies with other sustainability aspects (environmental, social, economic).
?	Robust evidence-based understanding of the impacts of food systems related to direct and indirect soil, water and air pollution that drive biodiversity losses, soil erosion, climate change and can negatively affect human health.
?	Improved capacity to reduce the environmental and climate impacts of food systems, particularly in relation to pollution.
?	Support to actors across the food systems through new available knowledge, shared existing data on environmental and climate impacts of food systems and identification of innovative solutions.
Scope: There is an increasing understanding of the impacts related to the green-house gas (GHG) emissions stemming from food systems. Around one third of human-caused GHG emissions worldwide originate from food systems.  A similar share of emissions is also recorded in Europe. Although the largest share of the GHG emissions and other relevant environmental impacts can be attributed to the primary food production (or harvesting in the case of fisheries), a significant amount of food-related environmental impacts is also generated in post-production and post-harvest processes along food supply chains. However, when considering wider environmental and climate impacts of food systems, more information is needed to understand these impacts, particularly when it comes to pollution stemming from food processing, manufacturing, packaging, distribution, trade, consumption (including emerging food consumption trends, such as products of alternative diets), food waste and end of life practices.
The relevant data covering these latter industries or practices are often less available and/ or accessible compared to the agricultural data, for example through the CAP indicators. At the same time, knowledge gaps also exist when it comes to environmental impacts of primary food production and harvesting. Therefore, the successful proposal should fill the relevant knowledge and data gaps. It should explain how it will deliver co-benefits to some of the Food 2030 priorities: climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities. The data should be aligned with, and support the relevant objectives of the upcoming Sustainable food system framework initiative.
Proposals are expected to:
?	Collect relevant qualitative and quantitative data on environmental and climate impacts related to water, air and soil pollution stemming from the food systems, biodiversity losses, climate change and negative impacts on human health, as well as data on freshwater consumption, soil erosion, resource and energy efficiency of food production and supply practices.
?	Increase the accessibility of relevant high quality life cycle inventory data according to FAIR principles and the EU?s open science policy by setting up actions to develop, review and make available existing databases.
?	Provide new data based on requirements for Environmental Footprint compliant datasets  and in line with the 2021 Recommendation on the use of the Environmental Footprint methods .
?	Assess the environmental impacts of food systems from a life-cycle perspective, using the Environmental Footprint methods.
?	Identify and map opportunities and innovative solutions, including existing good practices that address the identified impacts and promote the uptake of sustainable food production (including harvesting) and/ or food supply practices, including consumption practices, with minimum impact.
?	Identify and map opportunities and innovative solutions, including existing good practices, that maximise synergies among the three dimensions of sustainability (i.e. environmental ? including climate and biodiversity, economic, social - including health), different sectors, as well as actors across the food systems (from production/ harvesting to consumption), minimising trade-offs and reducing pollution as well as other environmental and climate impacts in food systems as a whole.
?	Implement the multi-actor approach by involving a wide range of food system actors and conducting inter-disciplinary research.
?	In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.
?	Where relevant, build on and expand the results of past and ongoing research projects and collaborate with relevant initiatives.

Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhance urban water quality with a view of providing better guidance for policy making and prioritisation by developing integrated urban water quality monitoring management plans;
?	Sound, safer and risk-based urban water quality management plans supported by enhanced holistic monitoring, advanced novel methods and digital solutions, modelling and evidence-based scenarios;
?	Increase uptake of digital tools in the water sector to support water management decisions for all stakeholders.
Scope: Water management in urban areas is confronted with a wide range of water quality issues. Urban runoff, is an increasingly important source of pollution. This is going to be aggravated by an increasing frequency of extreme events, such as floods and droughts, due to the impacts of climate change, as well as the increasing sealing of surfaces and rapid growth of urban areas. Moreover, water leakages from ageing water-service infrastructure and combined sewer or storm water overflows, leads to additional pollution releases into the environment. Water quality deterioration due to trace organic pollutants such as pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, microbial contaminants, such as pathogens or antimicrobial resistance genes, micro-plastic, nanomaterial, and diffuse pollution from urban areas (roads, urban runoff) and from upstream agricultural areas or industries and many other pollutants often released unintentionally to the environment and finally leading to several forms of pollution of urban water sources. These issues are also exacerbated by the complex interactions between pollutions sources and pathways at the urban/catchment level interface.
In line with the ambition of the EU zero pollution action plan there is a need to develop an integrated and harmonised approach to monitor all sources of surface and groundwater pollution and their impact, including micro-pollutants, micro-plastics, pharmaceuticals and other contaminant of emerging concerns, as well as mixtures of pollutants.
This objective of this action is to develop and demonstrate a European wide ?whole system monitoring approach? to address emerging water pollution and water quality assurance in urban areas in various urban areas covering a wide number of water pollution challenges, , taking into consideration the interactions of pollution sources and pathways between urban areas and the surrounding river and where appropriate drainage basin, and improve the resilience of urban water systems towards pandemics and global and climate change challenges. New systemic concepts and holistic strategies to enhance urban water quality should be integrated and demonstrated in an operational environment, including decentralised systems, hybrid green-grey infrastructures or cascading use of water.
An advanced monitoring and control system, going beyond the conventional pollutants, linking drinking and wastewater urban cycles, integrating risk management approaches and exploiting upgraded digital solutions to support urban water quality management, should be developed and tested, combined with appropriate modelling tools and scenarios to assess and forecast the long-term impacts of future changing socio-economic and climatic conditions on water quality. This monitoring system should consider the overall monitoring and outlook requirements of the EU zero pollution action plan, the monitoring requirements of existing EU water policy legislation (e.g., Water Framework Directive, Drinking Water Directive , Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, Bathing Water Directive, etc.) and relevant national and/or European water quality monitoring tools, and develop recommendations and guidance to strengthen the implementation of the EU and/or national legislation. It should allow to identify cause-effect relationships and big data management to address quality pressures For this purpose there is a need to develop better methods to access chemical data to be able to track the use or the flows of chemicals in urban areas (e.g., to support case studies using mass balance approach to clarify hotspots of pollution sources). New and refined analytical tools and monitoring methods (e.g. effect-based monitoring, biological monitoring) to analyse broad spectrum of contaminants of emerging concerns should be also developed. Recommendations for the standardisation of monitoring and identification of contaminants (including detection limit) should be also provided.
To enhance the capabilities of real-time monitoring of water quality, the potential of earth observations technologies and the use of digital technologies, such as online sensors, artificial intelligence, digital twins, digital data spaces, etc. should be further explored and consolidated.
In general, the participation of academia, research organisations, utilities, industry and regulators is strongly advised, as well as civil society engagement whenever necessary, also aiming to broaden the dissemination and exploitation routes and to better assess the innovation potential of developed solutions and strategies. The direct participation of urban and catchment/river basin managing water authorities and utilities is essential.
Where relevant, activities should create synergies with the projects funded under the protecting drinking water and managing urban water pollution topics in the work programme from WP2021-2022, namely HORIZON-CL6-2021-ZEROPOLLUTION-01-03 and HORIZON-CL6-2022- ZEROPOLLUTION-01-04",

Project outcomes will contribute to enhance circular bio-based systems operating according to planetary boundaries, replacing fossil-based systems and their carbon footprint, mitigating climate change and protecting air, water and soil quality along industrial value chains, in line with the European Green Deal and the EU zero pollution action plan.
Projects results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhanced environmental performances of bio-based processes approaching the zero-waste, zero-pollution ambition.
?	Integrated pollution prevention and control in bio-based systems targeting soil, water and air quality as well as noise levels.
Scope: Pollution from anthropogenic activities undermines the integrity of Earth ecosystems and severely affects the natural resources essential for human life. The EU bioeconomy strategy 2030 sets environmental protection at the basis of the modernisation of bio-based industries in the Union, to ensure a trustful green transition of EU economy away from a linear fossil-based system.
To develop solutions for preventing and controlling pollution from bio-based industries, proposals should:
?	Design integrated technical solutions reducing exhaust flows from bio-based processes through innovative technologies of extraction, recirculation, fractionation and conversion of such flows, to reach the zero-pollution ambition starting from the emissions to soil, water and air. The exhaust flows considered should include the ones that are usually not considered in the common pollution prevention and control operations, such as hot water, vapours, odours etc. The reduction of impacts on climate change, based on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and accessorily via increase of carbon removals, and on biodiversity should be considered as well;
?	Individuate replacement of hazardous substances used in the processes with safe bio-based ones;
?	Design the biorefinery operations to re-circulate any process flows such as process air and water and to increase energy efficiency including heat recovery;
?	Design the biorefinery operations in order to reduce noise emissions;
?	Design circularity of any processes, including through symbiosis between industrial installations to share and exploit materials and carrier streams, and looking on the best practices already available or under development, including in other EU R&I programmes to reach the zero-waste ambition;
?	Develop a case-study of integrated zero-pollution technical solutions in a selected biorefinery and design the adaptation of the case-study to be operational at all scales, from the large/medium to the small scale (the latter shows potentially high specific environmental impacts);
?	Pilot and validate digital innovation for bio-based processes enabling the zero-pollution and zero-waste biorefinery ambition. Digital tools may include data sharing platforms for the management of supply and value chains, as well as industrial symbiosis operations between biorefineries, industrial hubs, etc.;
?	Develop and validate integrated monitoring systems, operated by the industry at the level of the biorefinery, of the effective reduction of pollutant emissions, affecting soil, water and air quality, noise levels and waste production from biorefineries.
Where relevant, proposals should seek links with and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing EU funded projects, including under the Circular Bio-based Europe JU and other partnerships of Horizon Europe.

Scope: The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership Water4All identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02: European Partnership Water Security for the Planet, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
The consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02: European Partnership Water Security for the Planet is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls in 2021 and 2022 based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented, in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.
The scope of the application for this call on the European Partnership Water Security for the Planet should focus on the 2023-27 programmes according to the partnership?s co-created strategic research and innovation agenda for seven years, which includes joint calls for research projects, activities to fostering the uptake of R&I results from various stakeholders, living labs and demonstration sites activities to demonstrate the efficiency of innovative solutions, activities to enhance international collaborations and support the achievement of the water related UN SDGs and transfer of in foreign contexts, where specific challenges can be encountered. Actions to ensure coordination and alignment of EU, national and regional programmes, to strengthen the research/policy interface and all horizontal activities to allow the Partnership to operate and to achieve its specific objectives should be also addressed.
It is expected that the partnership continues to organise joint calls on an annual base and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects.
Specific activities to strengthen the synergies of Water4All partnership with the related Missions and Partnerships, identified in the proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02 should be also described.
While the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02: European Partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All) and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.
Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-02 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and additional partners, if any, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement.
The partnership should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joints call for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programmes to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-2, Improve the reliability and effectiveness of alternative water resources supply systems and technologies,4/12/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 3.30-3,"Expected Outcome: In support of the European Green Deal and EU water-related policies, successful proposals will contribute to fostering the adaptation of water resources to climate change, in particular the expected impact of the Destination ?Land, ocean and water for climate action? to ?Advance understanding and science to support adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems, ocean, water and soil systems and economic sectors in the context of the changing climate?.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Recommendations on alternative water resources options in water scarce areas to address current and future challenges to water supplies and adapt to climate change, ensuring the water quality for a specific uses;
?	Support for decision makers to integrate alternative water resources supply technologies in their strategic plans for water resources management taking into consideration the relevant EU regulatory frameworks (e.g. water and marine related policies, climate change adaptation strategy, Fit for 55);
?	Increased societal awareness, acceptance of and trust in of several alternative water supply resources for water use in various societal, environmental and economic contexts;
?	Increased market potential of alternative water resources.
Scope: The search for affordable, acceptable and reliable solutions is today a common challenge for water supply planners. A changing climate and increasing water scarcity, population growth, urbanisation and intensifying economic activities have put a strain on traditional water resources, which typically rely on available surface and groundwater resources. Ensuring the availability and sustainability of both surface and groundwater is a key element of the new EU strategy on adaptation to climate change.
According to a recent report on the drivers of and pressures arising from selected key water management challenges (EEA, 2021), water abstraction for public water supply, agriculture and industry is the main significant cause of failure to achieve good quantitative status. Over abstraction of surface water bodies can alter freshwater ecosystems and have adverse ecological effects, including decline of biodiversity. In addition, the over abstraction of groundwater bodies can lower groundwater levels with further impacts on groundwater-dependent aquatic ecosystems and cause salinisation of coastal aquifers, making them unusable for drinking water supply.
To address these problems and in order to improve the security of water supply, alternative water resources, such as rainwater harvesting, storm water, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, are increasingly being used by water managers in rural, coastal and urban areas. However, in many case, the implementation of several alternative water resources is not sustainable and not embedded in a strategic integrated water management plan at river basin or regional scale. In many cases the negative environmental impacts and associated infrastructure maintenance and investments costs are not properly assessed, nor the costs associated with meeting the EU water policy related requirements (i.e. WFD requirements). Finally, the public/social acceptance of several alternative water resources is lacking and this prevent their further implementation and market uptake. Further research and innovation is needed for making full use of alternative water resources.
Additionally, assessments and recommendations of how alternative water supply sources and infrastructures can relate to existing - mostly centralized - water utility regimes remain unexplored and there is a need to explore how the regulations around these centralized regimes can support infrastructure diversification.
The objective of this action is to improve the sustainability of various alternative water supply resources in the context of climate change and water scarcity adaptation. To achieve this objective the following issues should be addressed:
?	Improve the efficiency, reliability and cost-effectiveness and sustainable design of a wide range of alternative water solutions (e.g., rainwater harvesting, storm water, water reclamation and reuse , brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge).
?	Assess the interaction between choices of the various alternative water supply technologies with the infrastructure design and development, the scale of operation and the water-energy interactions.
?	Assess various alternative water solutions with regards to their potential their innovation, climate mitigation and adaptation and their environmental and health impacts. Explore the potential of digital technologies for appropriate data collection and integration. Attention should be given to reducing the negative impacts of infrastructures to increase water supply in water-scarce areas as well as reducing water demand (rebound effect).
?	Develop a comprehensive framework or guidance tool for selecting specific technologies and management strategies for different water scarcity situations that can be adapted on a case-by-case basis and with a view of developing large-scale deployment strategies, in line with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive.
?	Assess the critical factors that hinder the public acceptance of alternative water resources and identify measures and actions (e.g., policy actions, marketing interventions) to encourage their acceptance.
The possible participation of the JRC in the selected project would ensure that the approach proposed can be integrated as a scenario in the tool used by the European Commission for the estimation of water availability.
This action should bring together relevant researchers, technology providers, water utilities, business representatives, investors, policy makers and other water users and citizens. The active participation and engagement of different stakeholders should span the entire project development and implementation to ensure performance and sustainability and maximise the final impact.
Proposals should cover various regions with a balanced coverage reflecting the various biogeographical and climate zones in Europe in a representative way.
The inclusion of relevant SSH expertise would be also needed to ensure the proposed solutions are also socially accepted",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-3, Ocean and coastal waters carbon- and biodiversity-rich ecosystems and habitats in Europe and the Polar Regions,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and, in particular with the objectives of the European Climate Law , the EU climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU proposal for a nature restoration law , the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Birds and Habitats Directives, the Regulation (EU) n. 734/2008 on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears, successful proposals should further the European efforts in achieving climate-neutrality by maintaining and enhancing natural carbon sinks and stocks in marine and polar ecosystems, while preserving and enhancing their biodiversity, including by unfolding the potential of nature-based solutions, where adaptations to climate change are also being fostered for enhanced resilience.
Successful proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better understood and enhanced mitigation potential of ecosystems, based on sustainable management of natural resources and climate change mitigation fostered through the maintenance and enhancement of natural carbon sinks and stocks, while preserving or enhancing biodiversity in ecosystems, in support of a sustained European leadership in ocean?climate?biodiversity nexus science;
?	Advanced understanding and science in support of adaptation and resilience of natural and managed marine and polar ecosystems in the context of a changing climate, including its interaction with other natural or anthropogenic stressors such as pollutants, invasive species or marine construction, and better understood impacts of climate change on coastal zones (including the associated ecosystems) and improved adaptive capacity of ocean and marine systems, including by unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;
?	Uncovered mitigation opportunities of newly emerging European and polar blue carbon habitats (novel habitats emerging due to the rising atmospheric CO2 that is intensifying climate change but also driving global and particularly polar greening; polar blue carbon increases with losses of marine ice (sea ice, ice shelf and glacier retreat) that generates a valuable negative feedback on (mitigating) climate change);
?	Reduced knowledge gaps for enabling the inclusion of carbon- and biodiversity-rich marine habitats and accounting in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and associated national climate plans and strategies (NAPs), such as additional national data collection, science and technical capacity, as well as significant contributions made to the implementation of the European Green Deal, particularly the climate and biodiversity objectives, the UNFCCC Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, the Global Biodiversity Framework, and global scientific assessments.
Scope: The ocean and coastal ecosystems and habitats play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, representing the largest long-term carbon sink. Over the past decade, research efforts to understand the ocean and blue carbon sinks and utilize their potential in climate mitigation frameworks has increased. There are remaining research gaps for advancing opportunities to incorporate potential ocean and blue carbon ecosystems into climate frameworks. Evaluating and quantifying the broad range of benefits provided by coastal and marine ecosystems should strengthen the ability to account for them in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and national adaptation plans (NAPs). Avoiding and reversing the loss and degradation and restoring carbon- and species-rich ecosystems in the ocean and coastal waters is highly effective and of highest importance for combined biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation actions with large adaptation co-benefits. If degraded or lost, these ecosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back into the atmosphere.
Actions should aim at developing innovative approaches to address only one of the following options:
?	Option A: European and polar blue carbon hotspots and priority areas for climate policy frameworks and effective management (TRL 3-5)
The research actions should map European and polar blue carbon hotspots and priority areas for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation potential, including an estimate of the area/extent of the habitats. In doing so, the successful proposal should rely on the synergistic use of Earth Observation data (in-situ, airborne, satellite) and models to monitor, evaluate and quantify both carbon fluxes and carbon stocks and stock changes in ocean and coastal reservoirs, to evaluate current trends and improve modelling skills and predictions, including using space and in-situ existing datasets and climate records that can be used as proxy (e.g., Copernicus, EMODnet).
The action should also gather information on organic carbon stocks and accumulation, their characteristics (source, lability, dissolved particulate, living, non-living), and their potential change under pressures from human activities. The action should identify the key characteristics that make the selected ecosystem and habitat a hotspot for blue carbon (i.e. geomorphology, physical-chemical characteristics, anthropogenic manipulation, sea level rise effects, etc.). The action should enable a better understanding of the dynamics of carbon between these reservoirs and the associated timescales involved. A quantification of the approximate amount of carbon (and preferably nutrients) fixed annually by those natural ecosystems in Europe, as well as a quantification of the annual degradation rates of the ecosystems and consequent reduction in carbon sequestration should also be carried out. This knowledge should then be consolidated into a framework for predictive tools to investigate climate-smart management scenarios at appropriate scales, as well as methodologies, methods, and guidance tailored to the specific EU maritime region. The research action will identify and recommend best suited, fit-for-purpose, climate smart and resilient initiatives and activities that are relevant to local communities in order to protect, sustainably manage, restore, and enhance blue carbon habitats. Particular attention should be given to win-win-win solutions and strategies that have multiple benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity gains and benefit to people, including nature-based solutions, ecosystem-based approaches and technological-ecological synergies (TES) (combining technological and nature-based solutions). Where applicable and desirable, socioeconomic aspect of sustainability should also be part of such solutions, in order to make the projects more socially acceptable; e.g. allowing for eco-tourism, recreational activities and/or extraction activities (for example recreational fishing with permits or mussels farming that does not require any feed inputs) could also allow symbiosis with the communities in the coastal areas in which these ecosystems are situated. Where appropriate, this should include technological-ecological synergies (TES) as an integrated systems approach that recognizes the potential co-benefits that exist in combining technological and nature-based solutions. The action should also assess the synergies and trade-offs of combining nature-based solutions and blue infrastructure with grey infrastructure (i.e. hybrid measures), assess the scalability of nature-based solutions and whether the same benefits and effects achieved on a small scale can be achieved by implementing them across larger spatial scales. Actions should keep in mind and address the challenge that several factors may limit the effectiveness of nature-based solutions applied to coastal areas, making the case for more effective long-term strategies and activities (lack of knowledge of the benefits and limitations of nature-based solutions options, poor planning of measures, impacts of extreme weather- and climate-related hazards, emission of CH4 and N2O, and biogenic calcification, risks of slow-onset events, such as increasing temperature and biodiversity loss, and their interaction with multiple drivers (e.g., land use change) and cascading tipping points related to ecosystem degradation). Many of the approaches are conceptually feasible or have been demonstrated in the laboratory, but their consequences for the ocean, including on its biodiversity are uncertain, especially if applied at scale. Any proposed solutions should have to keep the precautionary approach in mind and demonstrate that they are biodiversity positive and have no negative impacts on the marine environment and ecosystem functioning. Particular attention should be given to maladaptation solutions. For each proposed solution, the action should identify the status, costs, potentials, risk & impacts (including tipping points and irreversibility, as well as the challenges posed by the emissions of blue methane, sea level rise, underwater permafrost thaw, coastal nitrate enrichment, etc.), co-benefits, trade-offs and spill over effects, and role in mitigation pathways. In addition, the economic feasibility should be taken into account, as well as the cost/benefit ratio of natural regeneration (rewilding) vs. assisted (e.g., Posidonia beds restoration/protection against trawling) vs. full restoration.
The action should identify and quantify the impact of anthropogenically induced activities that lead to the disturbance, degradation and destruction of these habitats (with estimation of the most and least impactful activities, CO2 release in the atmosphere and the cost of no action) (direct or indirect pressure from human activities, such as bottom-contact fisheries, and climate forcing).
Finally, the action should make policy recommendations for advancing the incorporation of potential blue carbon ecosystems into climate frameworks, transforming science into effective policy and management and significantly contribute to the implementation of the European Green Deal and its climate and biodiversity strategies and objectives, including the Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles and the EU proposal for a nature restoration law  which includes targets.
?	Option B: Uncover mitigation opportunities of newly emerging European and polar blue carbon habitats (TRL 2-4)
Rising atmospheric CO2 is intensifying climate change but it is also driving global and particularly polar greening. Polar blue carbon increases with losses of marine ice over high latitude continental shelf areas. Marine ice (sea ice, ice shelf and glacier retreat) losses generate a valuable negative feedback on (mitigating) climate change. The research action should conduct exploratory research into potentially new habitats emerging that could yield both mitigation and biodiversity benefits, if appropriately managed. Among the emerging habitats that should be tested in terms of their emerging role in carbon storage and sequestration, with the aim of understanding of carbon sink balances and climate change?feedback variability and reduce uncertainty in model projections, are: blue carbon change with sea ice losses; blue carbon gains from glacier retreat along fjords (fjordic blue carbon, i.e. seabed biological carbon gains as a result of recent rapid glacier retreat along fjords); blue carbon gains from ice shelf losses through opening up of productive new habitat and leaving nutrient-fertilized wakes of enhanced productivity; slight increases in sea temperature may also increase polar blue carbon; blue carbon around Antarctica is increasing with climate change, and the productivity within emerging fjords is likely to further increase with age and seasonal sea ice loss; snow and ice retreat in the subarctic and subantarctic; marine ice losses that create new polar continental shelf habitat across millions of km2 and doubling seabed carbon stocks in 25 years; fjords that have become exposed by glacier retreat (fjords are hotspots for the burial and storage of organic carbon and for their potential to provide an important long-term global climate regulation service); massive coastal embayment emerging as a result of giant iceberg breakout from ice shelves; new and intense phytoplankton blooms around the Southern Ocean which have doubled carbon storage by seafloor organisms in the last 25 years; marine ice loss in the Arctic; macroalgal particulate organic carbon sinks; changes in primary production in open Arctic waters; loss of pagophilic (ice-dependent) species and lower albedo, macroalgae, bivalves; species yet to be discovered in polar and deep-ocean ecosystems; relatively inaccessible habitats; novel approaches to secure carbon stocks in the face of fishing disruption (e.g., through changes in target species, gear, target areas).The action should build on existing and novel datasets (in-situ and satellite) to gather carbon information on stocks and accumulation, carbon characteristics (source, lability), change under pressures from human activities if not protected, the potential for carbon sequestration and associated timescales, understanding of carbon dynamics, framework and criteria to integrate these considerations and predictive tools to investigate management scenarios at appropriate scales, including displacement and trade-offs. The action should identify the key characteristics that led to the selected ecosystem and habitat to be considered a hotspot for blue carbon (i.e. geomorphology, physical-chemical characteristics, anthropogenic manipulation, sea level rise effects, etc.).
The action should also identify and recommend best suited, fit-for-purpose, climate smart and resilient and locally informed actions, initiatives and activities to protect, sustainably manage, restore, and enhance these newly emerging European and polar blue carbon habitats and assess the impact of anthropogenically induced activities that lead to the disturbance, degradation and destruction of these habitats and assess the synergies and trade-offs of protection vs. no action.
For both options (A & B), international cooperation is strongly encouraged, with a strong linkage with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other project funded under this topic, and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe, and the EU Polar Cluster. Actions should build upon and link with Horizon projects (in particular project funded under the calls HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-02:Understanding the oceanic carbon cycle, HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-03: Understanding and valuing coastal and marine biodiversity and ecosystems services, HORIZON-CL6-2022-BIODIV-01-01: Observing and mapping biodiversity and ecosystems, with particular focus on coastal and marine ecosystems, HORIZON-CL6-2021-CIRCBIO-01-09: Unlocking the potential of algae for a thriving European blue bioeconomy, HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-01: European Blue Parks, HORIZON-MISS-2022-OCEAN-01-07: Integration of biodiversity monitoring data into the Digital Twin Ocean, EU PolarNET2), the Copernicus marine service, Sustaining Arctic Observing Networks (SAON), Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS), and international Ocean Observing Initiatives.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-4, Demonstration network on climate-smart farming ? linking research stations,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 20.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The knowledge base of climate-related farming practices is expanded, resulting in increased application of climate-neutral approaches;
?	Different methods of climate-smart agriculture in plant and animal production are assessed and evaluated with all relevant actors involved; with all relevant actors involved;
?	The involvement of and adoption by farmers of innovative / smart farming practices that mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and that foster adaptation of the sector to climate change is accelerated. In the long-term, this will support a more substantial contribution of the farming sector to mitigation of GHG emissions and to carbon storage;
?	Implementation of the EU carbon farming initiative, as presented in the communication on ?Sustainable Carbon Cycles?   is supported;
?	The involvement of Member States? and Associated Countries? agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS) in climate-related farming issues is increased, including through linking to national, regional and local projects under the European Innovation Partnership ""Agricultural productivity and sustainability"" (EIP-AGRI) and to research stations, with a view to wider dissemination and enhanced interaction within and across the Member States and Associated Countries.
Scope: The conservation and enhancement of Earth?s natural terrestrial carbon sinks such as soils and plants, forests, farmed lands and wetlands is crucial. The European Green Deal gives research and innovation (R&I) a significant role to play in supporting the design and implementation of policies that will ensure the achievement of the EU?s climate objectives. Project implementation is expected to contribute to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and help achieve climate-neutrality.
A wide adoption of practices contributing to mitigation of climate change and enhanced carbon storage by farmers is a priority to ensure that the EU reaches GHG mitigation objectives by 2030 and climate-neutrality for land use by 2035 and for the overall economy by 2050. Farming is also vulnerable to impacts of climate change; hence adaptation is of utmost importance. Mainstreaming the use of climate-smart practices has been recognised as a priority at the global level, including by the G-20.
The overall aim is to establish a three-level network in a phased manner over Cluster 6 work programmes 2021/2022 and 2023/2024. The first level is a network which engages front-runner farmers introducing on-farm trials and demonstration of innovations, using existing knowledge both in the EU and in Associated Countries (project ?Climate Farm Demo?). The second level is a network to connect to all advisors on the subject in the Member States, building on achievements of Horizon 2020 projects and EIP-AGRI operational groups and the development of Member States? AKIS, to ensure the provision of targeted advice. The third level of the network ? the present topic ? will engage and strengthen the capacity of experimental research stations on climate issues.
Proposals should:
?	Network existing research stations involved in adaptation to or mitigation of climate change in agriculture, to create an EU network including all Member States and where possible Associated Countries and to stimulate effective cross-fertilisation among them;
?	Exploit existing solutions and develop new ones through practice-oriented on-farm testing and demonstration in a co-creative approach with pilot farmers and their advisors;
?	Collect and compare tool-kits for assessing GHG balances at farm level, monitoring of performance in reducing emission, decision-support tools, climate services, etc. for possible use also on average farms;
?	Explore carbon farming techniques (as defined in the Communication on ?Sustainable Carbon Cycles?) and their outcomes, also in terms of better farm management; analyse costs of carbon farming management practices and revenue possibilities as well as related risk and challenges; develop and/or test monitoring, reporting and verification systems; facilitate knowledge exchange and support tailored training and advisory services;
?	Foster knowledge exchange within and among Member States and regions and establish links with the EIP-AGRI and Member States? AKIS networks and coordination bodies;
?	Include a task to collaborate with the project ?Climate Farm Demo? funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-04 and with the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-03 ?Demonstration network on climate-smart farming ? boosting the role of advisory services?.
The project should operate for at least five years and build on the outcomes of the climate-related projects from various funding sources. The project must implement the multi-actor approach and may involve social innovation.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-5, Pilot network of climate-positive organic farms,4/12/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic should contribute to mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and help achieve climate-neutrality by 2035 (in the land-use sector) and 2050 (across the EU economy). It will also contribute to meeting the target of the farm to fork strategy of having 25% of the EU?s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030, as well as to implementing concrete actions of the action plan for the development of organic production .
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	The capacity of organic holdings to mitigate and adapt to climate change is enhanced, with co-benefits for biodiversity, water, soil and air;
?	Qualitative and quantitative data on the climate-related and other (co-)benefits and impacts of organic production are made more easily accessible, contributing to building the knowledge base for EU policy design and implementation and to increasing consumer awareness of the benefits of organic production;
?	Carbon farming practices (as described in the Communication on ?Sustainable Carbon Cycles?  ) are further developed in the organic farming sector;
?	Agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS) and decision-support systems in the organic sector are strengthened, in particular with regard to climate adaptation and mitigation.
Scope: The conservation and enhancement of Earth?s natural terrestrial carbon sinks such as soils and plants, forests, farmed lands and wetlands is crucial. The European Green Deal gives research and innovation (R&I) a significant role to play in supporting the design and implementation of policies that will ensure the achievement of the EU?s climate objectives. Organic farming relies on management practices that contribute to climate change mitigation, with additional benefits for the environment and biodiversity. The organic sector also has a role to play in the implementation of the EU carbon farming initiative as developed in the 2021 Communication on ?Sustainable Carbon Cycles?.
Proposals should:
?	Establish a pilot network of existing and newly converted commercial certified organic farms and research stations representative of the main organic farming production systems (both plant and animal production) and regions in the EU.
?	Provide for the collection at farm and landscape level of data relevant to organic farming and to climate change and other environmental objectives;
?	Implement carbon farming techniques and analyse their outcomes, also in terms of better farm management; analyse costs of carbon farming management practices and revenue possibilities as well as related risk and challenges; develop and/or test monitoring, reporting and verification systems;
?	Enhance sharing of knowledge and best practice on adaptation to and mitigation of climate change in the organic sector, including with regard to carbon farming, with attention also to regions where the organic sector is less developed, and support tailored training and advisory services;
?	Ensure that project outcomes are made available also beyond the organic farming sector, including to other farmers who focus on low-input farming, circular agriculture and agroecology;
?	Establish links with projects under the topics on a demonstration network for climate-smart farming (HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-04 ? project ?Climate Farm Demo?, and HORIZON-CL6-2022-CLIMATE-01-03), on agroecological approaches for climate change mitigation, resilient agricultural production and enhanced biodiversity (HORIZON-CL6-2021-CLIMATE-01-05), and on improving yields in organic cropping systems (HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-3), as well as with the planned partnership on agro-ecology living labs and the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?.

Relevant inputs include in particular fossil fuels and fertilisers produced from non-renewable resources. The topic will contribute to the Destination?s expected impact of ?foster[ing] climate change mitigation in the primary sectors, including by the reduction of their GHG emissions and other pollutants?.
Successful proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better analytical tools and capacity to integrate the use of fossil energy and energy-intensive inputs in modelling and in socio-economic analysis more broadly;
?	Improved decision-making by farmers in relation to the consumption of energy and energy-intensive inputs, in particular mineral fertilisers;
?	Better capacity of the farming sector to cope with variations in the price of energy and energy-intensive inputs;
?	Direct and indirect dependence of the sector on hydrocarbons is reduced.
Scope: Proposals should:
?	Use foresight methods to elaborate scenarios of fossil energy and mineral fertiliser use evolution and dependence. Where available, reference scenarios of the European Commission (DG ENER) should be used to advance the state of the art;
?	Improve the capacity of models to take into account direct and indirect energy uses and prices;
?	Cover both macro and micro levels in the analysis. At the micro-economic level linkages should be established with the Farm Sustainability Data Network (FSDN) under development by the European Commission;

HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-7, Enhancing the sustainable production of renewable energy at farm-level,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic supports the implementation of the EU bioeconomy strategy by creating opportunities for new cooperation in production, sales and distribution of renewable energy, which can provide agricultural communities (conventional and organic sectors) with an extra source of income, while contributing to clean energy supply for society without harming the environment.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Development of sustainable solutions and business models to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 in the EU and ultimately achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
?	Identification of technical, economic, societal, environmental and regulatory barriers hampering further scale-up of renewable energy at farm-level
?	Development of suitable and sustainable solutions to produce co-benefits (e.g. energy production, higher productivity, less water use, further pollination) and increase their up-take in practice.
?	Recommendations for improved and targeted guidance, incentives and policies at regional, national and EU-level to reduce environmental impacts and financial risks for farmers.
?	Diversification and enhancement of agricultural incomes (organic and conventional farming).
Scope: Many different forms of renewable energy are produced in rural areas, ranging from wind, solar (including agri-voltaics) and geothermal sources to different forms of bioenergy. Between these renewable energy sources and the environment, there can be trade-offs (e.g. land use change, biodiversity loss, air pollution) but also synergies. Small and medium scale installations can provide opportunities for new cooperation in production, sales and distribution of renewable energy, and thus, can provide agricultural communities (conventional and organic sectors) with an extra source of income, while contributing to clean energy supply for society. If well planned and implemented, such installations can be deployed without harming the environment, or even with positive impacts, for example preserving soils quality, contributing to water retention, avoiding methane emissions or supporting pollination.
However, the variety of options also result in complex considerations, as the potential, performance and impacts of renewable energy technologies depend on natural conditions, size and type of farm, approaches designed and implemented, management techniques, degree of mechanization, geographic location, and socio-economic factors, such as awareness ,about technologies and their implementation, investment and advice support for farmers, as well as the surrounding energy system and energy infrastructure.
Proposals will:
?	Analyse the different options to deploy renewable energy installations on farms, thereby assessing their environmental impacts (on climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and natural resources depletion) and identifying the best options to mitigate trade-offs and supporting synergies in light of the sustainable management of agricultural land coupled with production of food and feed.
?	Assess the opportunities for and barriers (e.g., financial risks and incentives/policies to overcome them) to combine agricultural production and different sustainable renewable energy technologies.
?	Engage with relevant stakeholders and develop innovative business models for farmers producing sustainable renewable energy, including self-consumption, energy communities or direct feed into the electricity or gas grid or collective sales approaches that could potentially enhance profitability for farms.
?	Analyse the potential of smart energy systems in rural areas and consider economically viable energy storage and transformation solutions for combined production of biogas/ biomethane, solar and wind as well as smart battery and energy solutions, including power to gas (hydrogen), thermal energy storage for self-use and grid stabilisation.
?	Address the nutrient recovery and minimisation of negative environmental impacts, or even co-benefits, in the context of good agricultural practices and possible sanitary implications.
?	Promote bioeconomy-related interventions in the new CAP and provide advice and technical guidance for Member States.
Proposals are expected to cooperate with other relevant EU-funded research projects, in particular ongoing projects under Cluster 5 of Horizon Europe.
Proposals must apply the concept of the 'multi-actor approach? and ensure adequate involvement of the farming sector, and actors active in rural areas",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-8, Closing the research gaps on Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) in support of global assessments,4/12/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,5.00 to 6.00-3,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal and, in particular with the objectives of the European Climate Law, the EU climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU proposal for a nature restoration law , the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), successful proposals should further the European efforts in achieving climate?neutrality by advancing the understanding and science to support adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems in the context of a changing climate and biodiversity loss and by efficiently monitoring, assessment and projections related to climate change impacts, mitigation, and adaptation potential to deliver solutions for tackling emerging threats and support decision-making at regional, European and global levels.
Successful proposal results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Further developed key ocean monitoring indicators, Essential Climate Variables (ECVs from GCOS), Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs from GOOS) in compliance with international programmes (IPCC, WOA, IPBES, CMIP, CLIVAR, Ocean Health Index, UN Decade, ARGO) that support international global assessments and foster the development of a regional approach to ocean climate monitoring and reporting, overcoming current limitations and gaps;
?	Further improved Earth System Models (ESMs) representing key physical, biogeochemical and biological processes in the ocean with reduced uncertainty of climate change projections at regional scales, and reduced biases (i.e. in the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP7) models for ocean and polar regions);
?	Better understood links between ocean physical, biogeochemical and biodiversity (including microbes and macro-organisms) variability over time, and the impacts of environmental stressors (e.g., warming, extreme events, ocean deoxygenation, and acidification) on ocean health, GHG sources and sinks, biology and ecosystems, as well as advanced understanding and science in support of adaptation and resilience of natural and managed marine and polar ecosystems in the context of a changing climate, including its interaction with other natural or anthropogenic stressors like pollutants;
?	Strengthened development of common, agreed standards for climate records content, format, quality and validation methodology;
?	Enabled evidence-based decision?making (e.g., developing early warning ocean climate indicators); Sustained European leadership in ocean?climate?biodiversity science nexus supporting EU programmes e.g., the Copernicus climate service, marine service, EEA / JRC reporting and complementing other relevant European programmes (e.g., science programme of the European Space Agency); Significant contribution to the implementation of the European Green Deal and its climate and biodiversity objectives, the EU maritime strategy, to the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean  (both data and models components), and to global scientific assessments, such as the IPCC, IPBES and WOA, as well as to the UNFCCC Ocean and Climate Change Dialogue, UN Decade of Ocean Science and UN SDGs 13 and 14.
Scope: To be able to deliver ocean forecasts and early warnings, climate projections and assessments and protect ocean health and its benefits, it is vital to measure Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs). The Essential Climate Variables and Essential Ocean Variables form the basis of the Global Climate Indicators that contain key information for the most relevant areas of climate change. The physics, chemistry, biology and biodiversity (including microbes and macro-organisms) of the ocean system are irrevocably interlinked. Ocean ecosystems are subject to a multitude of stressors, including changes in ocean physics and biogeochemistry, and direct anthropogenic influences. Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems sustainable management and conservation requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools that can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies and provide decision makers and the public with the necessary information to assess the impact of policy decisions. In physical oceanography, essential variables have been collected globally in a standardized manner providing valuable input to the IPCC. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems should allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, production of biodiversity essential variables and associated climate records, with multiple societal benefits. This requires further standardisation and improved utilisation of existing sensors, as well as exploration and development of new sensor technology, suitable for ships, mooring and autonomous platforms, increased use of emerging remote sensing technologies at higher resolution.
One of the major roles of the research conducted under this topic should be to deliver integrated multidisciplinary ocean science by means of the physical, biogeochemical and biological/ecosystem research communities coming together and joining forces for development of Essential Ocean Variables, integration of observations from the different oceanographic disciplines into models for multidisciplinary analysis and reporting.
Actions should aim at developing innovative approaches to address only one following options:
?	Option A: Improving the monitoring, understanding, reporting (Essential Variables) and projections of essential physical oceanic processes related to climate and changes over time, and production of related Essential Ocean Variables and indicators, at regional or sea basin scale (sea state, ocean surface stress, sea ice, ocean surface heat fluxes, sea surface and subsurface salinity, sea surface height, sea surface and subsurface temperature, ocean circulation and surface and subsurface currents, ocean layering and density gradient, upwelling) (including GHG fluxes) (TRL 7-8).
The research action is expected to further develop essential physical ocean monitoring indicators, EOVs, ECVs, improve their performances (e.g. resolution, uncertainties) and support their integration in climate models in order to improve the understanding of important feedbacks (e.g., cryosphere?ocean interactions such as: permafrost thawing?ocean feedbacks, ocean?ice sheet coupling, wind? and wave?ice coupling and sea ice formation, carbon?climate feedbacks). The activity should improve monitoring and reporting in specific ocean areas such as at depth and in marginal areas, over the continental shelf slopes, coastal zones and polar areas. The action should combine observation analyses and models over different time scales (by making use of instrumental and proxy data), benefiting from latest advances in satellite measurements and in-situ, to improve the scientific understanding of the change and variability of ocean circulation and ocean heat content change, sea surface and subsurface conditions (temperature, salinity, sea ice, currents, deep convection), and the short- and long-term variability, as well as improve projections at regional scales.
The action should advance the scientific understanding of the projected decrease of Antarctic ice and Arctic sea ice and contribute to improving model projections of future changes, particularly at the regional level; of the potential connections between Arctic polar warming and sea ice loss and mid-latitude atmospheric variability; and the understanding and sea level long term prediction better considering the response of the ice sheets on multi-decadal to centennial timescales.
The action should advance in improving the characterisation of ice sheets and glaciers contribution in sea level monitoring, and projections, and advance our understanding and prediction of the multi-decadal reversibility. The action should contribute to the development of a more quantitative understanding and predictability of the processes that cause and maintain ocean extremes, and the conditions that are conducive for the generation of extremes.
?	Option B: Improving the monitoring, understanding, reporting (Essential Variables) and projections of essential biogeochemical oceanic processes related to climate and changes over time at regional or sea basin scale (oxygen, nutrients, inorganic carbon, transient tracers, nitrous oxide, ocean colour, particulate matter, dissolved organic carbon, elemental and isotopic tracers, stable carbon isotopes, marine debris) (TRL 7-8).
The action should further develop essential biogeochemical ocean monitoring indicators, EOVs and ocean ECVs. The action should support the development of the ocean component of climate models through a better representation of essential biogeochemical processes, microbe biomass and diversity and enable a better understanding of the links between ocean physical and biogeochemical variability. The action should combine GHG measurements in regions especially critical for GHG fluxes (the polar oceans, main open-ocean convection areas like the North Atlantic, southern hemisphere, coastal and marginal seas, or coastal upwelling zones) with relevant biogeochemical measurements (e.g., oxygen, nutrients, carbon) to support GHG data analyses and model simulations. The action should improve the understanding of ocean biogeochemical fluxes and turnover of carbon and nitrogen in the ocean using state of the art autonomous observation technology combined with remote-sensing. This includes quantifying fluxes between basins/regimes (e.g. Arctic to North Atlantic, or coastal to oceanic) and across boundaries (air-sea, water-sediment), as well as between chemical phases (such as inorganic to organic, particulate to dissolved). Focus should be on quantifying GHG reservoir size and change, and potential subsequent impact on GHG fluxes, ocean productivity, carbon sequestration, oxygen demand and carbonate system.
The action should further inform models and improve predictions of the Earth system response to ocean acidification and to the ocean biological pump, including the long-term trends in ocean chemistry, beyond the observational record (paleo-ocean acidification), for a better understanding of the multi-decadal reversibility or the hysteresis of ocean processes (like the AMOC). Links should be made with ocean stratification that acts as barrier for water mixing or carbon sequestration.
The action should improve observations for the interplay between carbonate chemistry and a variety of biogeochemical and physical processes, including eutrophication and freshwater inflow and outflow in coastal zones, and increase the robustness of future assessments of ocean acidification. The action should improve our understanding of changes in water mass ventilation associated with climate change and variability to gain further insights into future trends in ocean acidification.
The action should further research the net response of natural ocean CH4 and N2O sources to future warming, including permafrost, and predict the magnitude and timing of the responses of each individual process.
The action should make use of the recent developments, such as the Biogeochemical ARGO, to investigate extreme conditions, and extreme or compound events below the surface of the ocean, and their link to biogeochemical processes.
The action should further contribute towards the integration of more biogeochemical parameters, assimilation techniques, models and assessment strategies into ESMs.
?	Option C: Improving the monitoring, understanding, reporting (Essential Variables) and projections of essential biological and ecosystem oceanic processes related to climate and changes over time at regional or sea basin scale (marine habitat properties, calcifying organisms, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish, nekton migration, marine turtles, birds and mammals, hard coral, seagrass, mangrove, macroalgal canopy, microbe, invertebrate, ocean sound) (TRL 5-6).
The research action should further develop the essential biological and ecosystem ocean monitoring variables and indicators, and the development of early warning systems based on biological indicators (like marine calcifying organisms, coral reefs or plankton lifecycle).
The action should develop the integration (e.g., forcing, assimilation of boundary conditions, coupling, etc.) between climate models (physics and biogeochemistry) and ecosystem/marine habitat models to support ocean biodiversity variables and ECV development, in particular, quantifying the sensitivity of regional ecosystems responses to poorly-resolved, global, physical & biogeochemical inputs at model boundaries. The action should also identify & quantify the propagation of non-linear errors through the ecosystem models (from physics through biogeochemistry and to the highest trophic levels), including through better integration of numerical & statistical approaches allowing improved forecasting.
The action should further develop observation processing for biological and ecosystem EOVs and ECVs production, and assess needs for additional observations in support of biological EOVs and ECV development and validation. The action should support the development of common approaches and standards for the development of biological and ecosystem variables and ECVs for the oceans by strengthening the use of observation networks and relevant biogeochemistry, biological and ecological measurements; an increase use of high-resolution remote sensing technologies, and the development of inter-calibrated protocols, notably for macroalgae, coral reefs, mangroves, tidal marshes, saltmarshes and seagrass. Particularly, it should extend the physical, biogeochemical, and ecological data records needed to develop, initialize, and validate marine ecosystem forecasts.
The action should assess the integration of the whole model chain (ESM + biology) on some specific test cases to evaluate uncertainties and potential use of such a modelling capacity for climate scenarios development and policy - management: e.g., evaluation of impacts of overshoot on ecosystems due to extreme climate change scenarios, perturbation of the biological carbon pump in a changing ocean or tipping point effect, surpassing the physiological tolerance limits beyond which the resilience of the ecosystem is compromised.
Particular attention should be paid to impacts of warming and acidity, or changes in the frequency and intensity of disturbance regimes, as they may lead to the collapse or transition of ecosystems to a new ecological state, with a loss or altered biodiversity and ecosystem services. The action should advance our scientific understanding of how extremes affect organisms and ecosystems, in particular for the effect of dual- or triple-compound events, by better understanding the cumulative effects on biota of the multifaceted characteristics?from abruptness to recurrence?associated with individual extremes; and the role of the compounding effect of the different hazards, leading to a complex matrix of often new conditions. Furthermore, advances should be made with regard to closing gaps in our understanding of the factors controlling biological, genetic and functional diversity, food-web interactions and relationships between different ecosystem constituents (trophic links, symbiosis, parasitism, etc.), and, also with regard to the physiological states and trophic modes (mixotrophy) of populations, before these models can be made operational in future forecasting and impact projection applications.
The action should establish protocols for the scientific validation of forecasts to validate results and build trust in forecasts, and ensure forecasts have the necessary spatiotemporal resolution for analysis and application to marine resource management, or to force downscaled regional forecasts.
The action should contribute towards the integration of more ecosystem parameters, assimilation techniques, models and assessment strategies into ESMs.
For all three options (A, B & C), actions should result in better scientific understanding and quantification of tipping points and abrupt system changes, and associated impacts, including aspects of irreversibility and compound events. Actions should support a regional approach to ECVs, EOVs, ocean monitoring indicators and climate change / ocean health assessment, taking into account sea basin specificities. The action should result in spatially and temporally explicit information about physical, biological, and chemical properties of the ocean. Actions should also advance the understanding of the impacts caused by the crossing of tipping elements and develop early warning indicators. Where appropriate, the combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal and/or environmental risk should be assessed. Actions should identify safe operating spaces for the ocean to provide life-support systems for humanity, accompanied ? where relevant ? with long-term strategies for preventing or mitigating impacts. To better monitor significant changes in physical and biogeochemical environments and their impacts on ecosystems and society, actions should enable further integration of multidisciplinary observation systems (in-situ, airborne, satellite) and improved models. The assessments of cumulative effects should look at existing and past activities in the marine environment but should also allow for foresight in order to inform planning of future activities and support management that is adaptive to future conditions and sustains ecosystems and human well-being.
The actions funded under this topic should have a strong collaboration element and mechanism in order to ensure that the topic delivers on its key research priorities and help characterize the interplay and dependence between the biological, chemical, and physical properties of the ocean environment. The actions should build on existing observing platforms, Copernicus, and strengthen and expand the current capacities in a multidisciplinary and ecosystem-based approach. This multidisciplinary approach is key to comprehensively understand the variety of effects of global change on the ocean and its ecosystems. This topic provides for the opportunity to strengthen the interaction between biological and physical and biogeochemical platforms and research communities. To this end, proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other projects funded under this topic, and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives in Horizon Europe. Relevant activities of the plan will be set out and carried out in close cooperation with relevant Commission services, ensuring coherence with related policy initiatives.
International cooperation will be essential in integrating and coordinating these different scaled approaches. A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance, UN Decade of Ocean Science, and GOOS bio-eco panel. Actions under this topic will build upon and link with Horizon projects (COMFORT, PolarRES, CrIceS, EuroSea, AtlantOS, EPOC, OCEAN ICE, OceanICU, Jetzon, DOOS, etc.), the Copernicus marine service, GOOS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), MBON of GEOBON, ICOS, GCOS, and other relevant international Ocean Observing Initiatives. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS, and EMODnet).
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between the European Space Agency and the European Commission on Earth System Science. Under the initiative, both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementarities between the Horizon Europe and the European Space Agency FutureEO programmes, and their projects. Proposals under this topic should address networking and collaborative research activities with relevant European Space Agency actions. In particular, the European Space Agency will contribute to this topic with existing and planned projects focused on enhancing the observation capacity and understanding from satellite EO technology of the relevant ocean processes .

Proposals should address the collaboration with ongoing or future ESA projects, including those that will be funded through dedicated coordinated invitations to tender, and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for effective coordination. Applicants are encouraged to contact ESA to organise the joint European Commission-European Space Agency work.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-5, Climate-smart use of wood in the construction sector to support the New European Bauhaus,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 7.00-2,"Expected Outcome: This topic will support the New European Bauhaus initiative and the implementation of the new EU forest strategy by making the construction sector more renewable and circular especially for existing buildings, which includes the use of currently underused timber such as hardwoods, salvage wood and post-consumer wood for traditional and newly emerging innovative woody biomass-based applications, while including circularity as part of a broader system and design loop.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Enhanced contribution of the forest-based sector with respect to climate change mitigation and adaptation, a toxic-free environment and rural development objectives.
?	Pathways for an efficient conversion of solid biomass into forms of long-term carbon storage.
?	Enhanced contribution of the forest-based sector to decarbonisation strategies for buildings, both in terms of operational emissions, embodied emissions, and carbon removals, in relation to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the renovation wave strategy, the Construction Products Regulation and other EU policies on buildings.
?	Contribute to a robust and transparent methodology to quantify the climate benefits of wood construction products and other building materials, reflecting the most advanced dynamic life-cycle analyses and in view of contributing to the carbon farming initiative and carbon removal certification.
?	Increased resource efficiency and minimisation of environmental footprint of wood products used in construction works.
?	Better knowledge about the quantitative limits of global wood supply and the limits of wood as a resource.
Scope: Wood materials remain considerably under-utilised in the construction sector despite their durability and appreciation by end users. At the same time, there is a need for making the construction sector more renewable and circular, which includes the use of currently underused timber such as hardwoods, damage wood and post-consumer wood, while including circularity as part of a broader system and design loop. This requires new raw material sources and secondary material, technologies, and designs for wood components, specified products and for wooden buildings. Buildings need also to be adapted to climate change, including as regards summer and winter thermic performance.
Proposals will:
?	Analyse the potential market and new technologies (such as the use of AI, IoT sensors or robotics) as well as processes for the utilisation of hardwoods, low quality, damage, and post-consumer wood in the construction sector, including for the refurbishment of buildings.
?	Explore the potential of zero-waste concepts by developing solutions for each source type to turn into viable products as elements and as whole buildings in the wood construction sector.
?	Design wood building blueprints based on these products and other underutilised bio-based materials, taking into account the reuse, adaptability and healthy living environment (e.g. avoidance of hazardous substances) into the design.
?	Study and integrate human health and wellbeing aspects, as well as the cultural traditions of local crafts and design languages, as integral elements of the built space.
?	Analyse and propose systems to overcome technical, logistical, legal, business, political, economic, knowledge and social barriers, challenges and opportunities and derive integrated policy recommendations and business strategies for enlarging the wood construction sector in Europe.
?	Include the reuse, recycling, renovation and deconstructivity into product and building design concepts.
?	Develop robust, transparent and cost-effective methodologies to quantify the carbon removal benefits of key wood construction products and other building materials.
?	Develop roadmaps to mainstreaming multi-story wood buildings in Europe, which are the main market segment in living and commercial/office spaces in cities.
?	Engage with relevant stakeholder in co-creation processes (e.g., the New European Bauhaus Community of Partners, policy, architects, business, insurance, investment, society, public and private sector).
?	Link with other selected proposals and the NEB Lab and establish an open-access wood construction observatory in Europe, to monitor and update progress, statistics, good practice guidelines and solutions on wood construction.
?	Address policy frameworks and standards that are still hindering innovation and further market development, as well international production norms and standards for assessing the ecological effects, climate adaptation and climate footprint of buildings which do not account for all benefits of wood.
The project must implement the multi-actor approach and ensure an adequate involvement of the primary production sector and the wider forest-based value chain
This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and capitalise on previous research results (e.g., BASAJAUN , Build-in-Wood , etc.), as well as the results of the LIFE Strategic Projects from the LIFE Circular Economy and LIFE Quality and Climate Action Sub-programmes.
Proposals are encouraged to/should consider social innovation when the solutions is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices, social ownership or market uptake.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties e.g. to primary producers, academic researchers, start-ups, SMEs, and other multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate developed applications. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted. Maximum 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-6, Ocean models for seasonal to decadal regional climate impacts and feedbacks,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 4.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Successful proposals will contribute to the European Green Deal, addressing resilience to climate change (mitigation and adaptation) in coastal areas. Improved ocean models for 21st century climate projections, from regional to coastal scales, and from seasonal to decadal timeframes, will support the sustainability of the blue economy and the protection of ocean health and coastal landscapes.
The proposals will support the Digital and Green Transitions and will directly support Destination Earth  and the development of the Digital Twins, and the Digital Twin Ocean  in particular. They should contribute to the improvement of marine information services provided by European programmes like Copernicus, and their uptake at local, coastal and EU regional levels.
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Demonstration of the fit for purpose and configuration of ocean models, for climate change impact assessment in European sea basins and coastal areas, in particular on marine ecosystems;
?	Demonstration of EU basin scale to coastal ocean climate services that support policy implementation and the development of climate adaptation strategies and of a carbon-neutral blue economy (e.g., ocean climate risk services);
?	Development and publication of indicators on ocean status and health, targeted towards territorial decision-makers, complementary to current Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables  or Copernicus Ocean State Reports ;
?	Integration of the developments in the digital perspective, interoperable and/or integrable with Destination Earth and the Digital Twin Ocean;
?	Fostered collaboration between the climate science community and operational oceanography communities (operating ocean services on a sustained way).
Scope: A current limitation to climate change projections for EU-basin scale to coastal use comes from an insufficient representation and resolution of basin and coastal ocean dynamics and from an unsatisfactory understanding of the oceanic biogeochemical cycle. Most climate models include the ocean dimension that stops at the regional scale as defined by meteorology and climatology like in CORDEX In parallel, operational oceanography centres develop and operate ocean models (physics, biogeochemistry, sea-ice) for daily ocean forecasting and reanalysis that represent more exhaustively the full ocean dynamics. Methods should help close the gap between current climate projections (global, centennial) on the one hand and existing Copernicus Marine physics and biogeochemical models used for daily ocean forecasting.
Proposals are expected to focus on:
?	Developing capabilities for producing decadal to long-term (multi-decadal to centennial) refined predictions of the ocean state, at the scale of European regional seas including the coastal zones, where climate change risk is considered to be particularly high;
?	Improving the representation of ocean processes (and dynamics, especially at regional to coastal scale) that can be integrated in in climate models;
?	Developing capabilities for producing decadal to long-term EU basin scale predictions of biogeochemistry models to support feedback into global/regional marine ecosystem models and climate models;
?	Validating the approach by performing historical runs and comparing corresponding model results to observations, proxy information, and / or reanalyses over an instrumental multi-decadal period, up to centennial scales, with characterized uncertainties;
?	Investigating and assessing the quality of coastal models or ecosystem models of the low to mid trophic food web levels, over European seas and their coastal zones, with characterized uncertainties.
Methodology and developments should be benchmarked with two relevant use cases, to be showcased in three different European regional seas and coastal areas involving both scientists and end users:
?	Development and demonstration of regional ocean climate risk services in coastal areas, due to sea level rise, waves, surges, or any other extreme event;
?	Development and demonstration of regional ocean climate services in coastal areas supporting the blue economy (e.g. aquaculture, marine renewal energies, tourism).
Proposals shall demonstrate that the targeted scientific framework, ocean models integrated into EU basin scale climate models and resulting in basin scale ocean services for the marine and maritime sectors can be replicable to all EU regional seas. Proposals should plan resources for coordination and networking activities with related projects, in particular those funded under the Missions ?Restore our Ocean and waters by 2030? and ?Adaptation to Climate Change?, as well as with relevant projects funded under Cluster 4 ? Space addressing Copernicus services (marine, land, emergency, climate), Cluster 5 Destination ?Climate sciences and responses for the transformation towards climate neutrality?, and Cluster 6, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities to break the silos between science communities.
The proposal should favour open data, open source, and public-use models and algorithms with open source licensing and integrable in the Digital Twin of the Ocean. Proposals should leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces in the data-driven analyses. Projects could additionally benefit from access to infrastructure and relevant FAIR data by collaborating with projects funded under the topics HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03: FAIR and open data sharing in support of healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters and HORIZON-INFRA-2024-EOSC-01-01: FAIR and open data sharing in support of the mission adaptation to climate change.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-CLIMATE-01-7," EU-China international cooperation on improving monitoring for better integrated climate and biodiversity approaches, using environmental and Earth observation",2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal is aiming to improve terrestrial monitoring as well as maximising synergies with biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation and adaptation, by using or acquiring environmental data, particularly geographically explicit data such as ground-based observation and remote sensed Earth observation data. This with a view to contribute to the objectives of climate-neutrality, adaptation to climate change and reversing biodiversity loss at global levels, with a focus on the EU and China. Synergetic solutions, including nature-based solutions such as the protection, the restoration and the sustainable management of terrestrial land, can contribute to enhancing carbon dioxide removals from the atmosphere, while reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience to climate change impacts, and contributing to biodiversity conservation and restoration.
The successful proposal will furthermore contribute to an advanced understanding of science to support integrated climate and biodiversity actions on natural and managed ecosystems and associated economic sectors. It will do so by advancing solutions for monitoring, assessment and projections to support decision-making in better integrated climate and biodiversity policies in terrestrial ecosystems generally.
The successful proposal is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Protect biodiversity and maximize synergetic benefits of biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation and adaptation based on both remote sensing and ground-based observation;
?	Development and exchange of best practices in using ground-based observation and Earth observation data and information, and establish standard and indicator system for biodiversity measurement for better integrated approaches in order to deliver increased synergies between mitigation, adaptation and conservation.
?	Geographically-explicit monitoring on regions that has been identified high biodiversity value and/or subject to biodiversity protection and restoration provisions due to high climate risk;
?	Strengthen scientific research in supporting of the synergies between the monitoring and reporting frameworks under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), including on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, for better implementation and progress assessment of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.
Scope: The EU and China face similar challenges as a result of climate change where it comes to biodiversity related aspects, while reaching climate neutrality will require critical contributions from terrestrial land, including through enhancing net carbon dioxide removals. Similar challenges could benefit from similar actions and defining best practices in improving monitoring of terrestrial ecosystems in order to design better approaches integrating climate change adaptation and mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.
The successful project should provide improvements in biodiversity monitoring infrastructures in support of integrated approaches able to deliver better synergies between mitigation, adaptation and conservation. Such integrated approaches can include a wide range of mitigation options, such as protection and restoring natural ecosystems, sustainable land management practices, sustainable forest and grassland management. Such options, based on a smart use of natural ecological processes and improved technologies, contribute to improving the quality, diversity and resilience of ecosystems, all of which have substantial benefits for biodiversity.
Most monitoring instruments for climate and biodiversity indicators on terrestrial land are carried out in a non-integrated manner and are based on statistical inventories without explicit geographical resolution. Earth observation (including satellite and near surface remote sensing as well as ground based methods), alongside analysis tools such as Geographic Information Systems, can be combined as multiple geographically-explicit data sets. Data acquisition, processing, cross-referencing and coherent integration on terrestrial land require substantial research and innovation investments.
Improving ground-based monitoring for better integrated approaches should assess or set up a strategy to assess the potential of natural and managed terrestrial ecosystems to contribute to:
?	climate mitigation, including enhancing net carbon removals,
?	climate adaptation, including resilience and disaster risk prevention, and
?	protection, conservation and restoration of biodiversity.
Improving existing monitoring, including through designing new datasets and methods to set up a geographically-explicit monitoring of climate and biodiversity aspects fits within the scope of this topic.
The successful proposal should contribute to a strengthened cooperation between the EU and China, also in the context of a better cooperation under the Group on Earth Observations initiatives, building on the climate and biodiversity monitoring networks in China and the EU.
This topic is part of the EU-China flagship initiative on Climate Change and Biodiversity, which will promote substantial coordinated and balanced cooperation between the EU and China and is within the scope of the Administrative Arrangement between the European Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People?s Republic of China on a Co-funding Mechanism for the period 2021-2024 to support collaborative research projects under the Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) and the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiatives.
The use of existing data and information coming from e.g. Copernicus and GEOSS is encouraged. Interaction with other actions developed under the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Research Flagship and/or the Flagship on Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies is encouraged, as well as related topics within Cluster 5 and 6 and existing cooperation between the EU and China on land, including soils",

Projects will also address these challenges by piloting innovative solutions that foster social economy and improve social inclusion of people in a situation of vulnerability.
Proposals are expected to:
?	Identify and analyse the drivers of social exclusion and the challenges to address disparities and marginalisation in various rural areas in Europe, (e.g., remote rural areas, rural areas in the EU's outermost regions (defined in article 349 TFEU), costal and mountain areas, rural areas close to towns and cities);
?	Gain a better understanding of the needs of and challenges faced by people in a vulnerable situation in various rural areas of Europe, the possible ways to address economic and demographic challenges, including ageing, disability, and vulnerability of young people where relevant (in particular those not in employment, education or training NEET), and accessibility to adequate services (e.g. considering also universal design), including social ones (e.g. for people with mental or physical disabilities);
?	Benchmark policies, services, including social ones, and initiatives developed at various levels to empower people in a vulnerable situation to full and effective participation and inclusion in society, including social economy and entrepreneurship (e.g., social farming, itinerant services and mobility, multishops), pooling of services and creation of meeting places to enhance social interaction (e.g., multidisciplinary health houses, associative caf‚s), public-private partnerships, and rural-urban linkages. Assess the quality, strengths and weaknesses of these services and to what extent they are used by/reach the target groups;
?	Explore the role, potential and limitations of social economy and social enterprises in supporting the population in a vulnerable situation in rural areas, including for the provision of basic and adequate social services;

?	Accompany pilot innovation actions supporting people in a vulnerable situation and social entrepreneurship to draw additional knowledge from concrete examples.
Proposals should be innovation-oriented and must implement the multi-actor approach, bringing together multiple science fields, in particular the social sciences and humanities (SSH) (e.g., sociology, behavioural sciences, psychology, economics, etc.), and actors with complementary roles and experiences (e.g., representatives of people in a vulnerable situation, service providers, health services, associations, public authorities, universal designers, etc.).
Proposals should cover a representative variety of European rural areas, consider various types of vulnerability (including gender and intersectionality when relevant), and take stock of and experiment a variety of social economy and service provision examples.
Projects should build on existing results, findings and good practices. For instance they could explore activities undertaken by Horizon Europe projects funded under the topics HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-02 and HORIZON-CL2-2021-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-03.
Finally, projects funded under this topic should coordinate activities between them to avoid overlaps and benefit from synergies. Proposals should allocate appropriate budget and resources to implement this task",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-COMMUNITIES-01-2, Improving rural future through better territorial governance and rural-urban synergies,4/12/2023,IA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.50-2,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced equitable and inclusive development of rural areas, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal, in particular to the farm to fork and the biodiversity strategies, the organic action plan, the common agricultural policy (CAP), the long-term vision for the EU?s rural areas and its objectives (contributing to make rural areas stronger, connected, resilient and prosperous) and to its flagship initiative ?Research and innovation for rural communities?, and the EU territorial agenda for 2030.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	Improved connections, strategies and governance arrangements that foster synergistic development and just transition of rural and urban areas and more integrated territorial policies and strategies in a growing number of localities;
?	Improved business and innovation opportunities thanks to a more proximate, circular and green economy and renewed vitality of rural places through a better connectivity, improved valorisation of cultural and natural heritage, and stronger innovation ecosystems;
?	Improved mutual access of rural and urban actors to services provided by either type of areas;
?	Improved social connectivity, social capital, resilience, and capacity to face changes as well as of innovating, and increased understanding of the cultural connections between rural and urban communities and strengthened sense of territorial identity.
Scope: Rural and urban areas are interdependent and can mutually benefit from a territorial planning that takes into consideration their interactive relationship.
People, goods, services, information, financial capitals, energy, etc. flow between these areas, but these linkages are often neglected by policy makers that tend to deal with rural and urban issues separately. Proposals should aim at improving rural-urban cooperation, connections and planning for an integrated territorial development that adopts equitable measures to respond to socio-environmental disparities and foster sustainable growth.
Proposals are expected to support specific projects for developing rural-urban territorial partnerships to enhance the well-being of rural and urban people, increase resilience and favour a more synergistic/interlinked/networked development of rural and urban areas.
Proposal should also prioritise experimentation and innovation in domains that have been demonstrated to favour bi-directional urban-rural synergies and the development of a well-being economy: proximity (shortening distances/value chains including in the agri-food sector with particular attention to organic production), greener economy/society (e.g. ecosystem services and protection and restoration of biodiversity and natural capital, including nature-based solution ? NBS), circularity (closing loops/ flows), services (improving social connectivity, new ways of working and living, pooling of and/or itinerant services), culture, landscape and heritage (building territorial identities as well as improving access to a valorised cultural heritage and cultural life) and mobility (sustainable and affordable mobility alternatives for rural residents).
Projects financed under this topic should capitalise on lessons learnt to further upgrade and future-proof policy frameworks and enabling environments.
Proposals should pay attention to the ecological and digital transitions, the potential of digital technologies as well as social inclusiveness, environmental knowledge and access of rural communities to good quality services and opportunities. In addition, they should analyse the impact caused by COVID 19 pandemic on integrated territorial development and address challenges that resulted from it.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and bring together multiple science fields, in particular the social sciences and humanities (SSH) (e.g., economics, human geography, political science, cultural studies, etc.), and actors with complementary roles and experiences (e.g., service providers, transport services, public authorities, associations, innovators, small and medium enterprises -SMEs - etc.).
Proposals should cover a representative variety of European rural areas (e.g. rural-costal areas, mountains areas, remote rural areas) and build on results of relevant Horizon 2020 projects such as RURBAN, ROBUST (e.g., rural-urban learning hub), COASTAL, RURITAGE, RURALURE, SmartCulTour, TExTOUR, and FOODSHIFT 2030 and seek to improve/uptake governance and role models they have identified as promising.
Projects financed under this topic should create synergies with the New European Bauhaus (NEB) projects, facilitating ideas flows from urban to rural settings and vice-versa. For instance, some NEB projects could inspire good practices on the reuse of buildings in rural areas that can function as innovation hubs or build links between urban and rural areas. Proposals should allocate adequate budget and resources to implement this task.
This topic is open to financial support to third parties as an option either to select pilots for developing partnerships or innovative solutions aiming at contributing to integrated territorial development.
Finally, proposals are encouraged to leverage the data and services available through European Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data from relevant Data Spaces",

Project results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	Improved understanding of rural development and territorial policies existing across the world, as well as delivery mechanisms by policy makers at different levels (e.g. international, national, regional and local).
?	Upgraded and more innovative and integrated rural policy frameworks (e.g. for rural revitalisation and attractiveness, for improving rural innovation ecosystems, for urban-rural linkages, for improved adaptation strategies, plans and measures that aims at addressing climate change in a systemic manner) at different levels (e.g. international, national, regional, local) capitalising on international knowledge exchange to increase inclusive and sustainable rural well-being;
?	Enhanced uptake of a positive narrative on the future of rural areas at international level by policymakers.
Scope: The study and implementation of rural policies is unequally advanced across the world. The project funded under this topic should contribute to increase policymakers? understanding of rural challenges and strengthen their capacities to implement adequate policy responses to these challenges in order to increase inclusive and sustainable well-being in rural areas, considering also climate change mitigation and adaptation. Proposals are expected to work by adopting a holistic vision to rural development and/or revitalisation, avoiding a sectorial approach (e.g. rural development should not be limited to agricultural development, but overarch several aspects of the rural life).
Proposals are expected to:

?	Provide recommendations to policy makers at different levels (e.g. international, national, regional and local) on how to best address rural needs and challenges and foster sustainable balanced, equitable and inclusive development of rural areas.
?	Provide recommendations to policy makers at different levels, in particular regional and local, on how to best access and make use of existing funds.
?	Projects should provide relevant results, in particular develop a framework to measure communities? well-being beyond economic indicators (including social, health-related, environmental) to measure policy impacts in rural areas that can be linked with the work of the upcoming EU Rural Observatory.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines (e.g., economics, international studies, development studies, political science, citizen engagement studies, and human geography).
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-COMMUNITIES-01-4, Investigating the contribution of geographical indications (GIs) to sustainable development and optimising support for newly established schemes,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal should support the objectives of the farm to fork strategy for sustainable food as well as to strengthen the contribution of the system of geographical indications (GIs) to support those objectives.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Better understanding of the contribution of GIs schemes to sustainable development and in particular to achieve the objectives of the farm to fork strategy.
?	Sustainability attributes in GI schemes are widely implemented by the producers and recognized and correctly interpreted and understood by consumers.
?	Better design and implementation of GIs policy to foster their delivery of sustainable agriculture, aquaculture and fishery, healthy and sustainable diets and sustainable food systems.
Scope: The EU is renowned for its high quality food products having specific characteristics or farming attributes that distinguish them in the marketplace, and particularly those labelled under registered geographical indications (GIs). The quality and diversity of the Union's food production is one of its important strengths giving a competitive advantage to its producers and making a major contribution to its living cultural and gastronomic heritage.
Quality schemes can benefit the rural and coastal economy. This is particularly the case in disadvantaged areas, in mountain areas and in the most remote regions where the farming sector already takes a significant part of the economy and production costs are high. They can create value for local communities through products that are deeply rooted in tradition, culture and geography.
Building on the state-of-the-art in particular, but not limited to, on results of the Strength2Food project , the proposals are expected to focus on GIs schemes.
Proposals are expected to:
?	Provide a sound analysis of the state-of the art in research on the impacts of GIs schemes in terms of all aspects of sustainability;
?	Assess sustainability impacts of all GIs products (>3000) in all three dimensions, i.e., economic, social and environmental (including use of natural resources, cultural heritage preservation, public health);
?	Comprehensively map the practices in GIs production systems and identify those that minimise the negative environmental and social impacts and at the same time balance the economic dimension of sustainability;
?	Investigate how to better valorise the sustainable deliverables of GIs, including the type and characteristics of public goods generated by the GI production and the benefits for local areas and society at large;
?	Identify synergies among different intervention schemes in order to increase the participation of farmers and fishermen;
?	Explore consumers? perception of GIs, including the demand for valorising GIs as qualifier of shorter food supply chain, and how to better promote GIs that are aligned with healthy and sustainable diets to increase demand and willingness to pay for GI products.
?	Explore and benchmark the approaches/policy followed by the different Member States and Associated Countries when it comes to GIs and sustainability;
?	Formulate best practices, decision tools, recommendations to be used by producers and policy makers to improve sustainability of the GIs schemes and optimise the support for newly established GI schemes that are aligned with healthy and sustainable diets;
An adequate representation of consumers? interests by bodies that are knowledgeable of policy issues involved needs to be ensured, at least for those aspects of the project that involve consumers, consumers? information and perception",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-COMMUNITIES-01-5, Assessing urban farming impacts,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposals will support the European Green Deal, farm to fork strategy and impact assessment for the post-2027 common agricultural policy (CAP).
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	Improved knowledge on impacts and risks of various types of urban farming from the economic, environmental and social perspective, with a particular focus on spill-over effects into rural and peri-urban areas;
?	Improved awareness of policy makers helping them adjust policy and legal frameworks to foster benefits and mitigate risks associated to the development of various forms of urban farming and related technologies.
Scope: Proposals are expected to:
?	Assess current and future (foresight) contribution of various forms of urban farming to:
o	Overall food supply, food security and resilience mainly for urban citizens but also addressing potential food security impacts on rural populations, factoring in megatrends and potential risks around key inputs or conditions enabling urban farming;
o	Evolution of farm income in urban and rural areas, the distribution of value added in the supply chain and possible effects on the bargaining power of supply chain actors;
o	The provision of ecosystem services in urban and rural areas against the evolution of environment and climate conditions (including water and nutrient use and cycling, biodiversity protection, energy use, soils including soil health, regulation of the urban heat island effect etc.), in relation with European Green Deal objectives;
o	The provision of social benefits (e.g., access of new and/or young farmers, gender equity, place-based/community development) and improvement of social capital (e.g., values, networks, governance) and community cohesion in urban and rural areas. Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) aspects should be an integral part of the proposal;
o	The demand for new skills, training and educational offer also taking into account the technological or social dimensions of different forms of urban farming.
?	Compare the conditions under which various types of urban, peri-urban or rural farmers operate in order to identify the challenges that may justify targeted regulatory or policy initiatives. Conditions are to be understood in a broad sense, including e.g., initial investments, production, quality control, labelling, marketing and retail as well as the legal and enabling environment in which they operate.
?	Support the discussion on rationale for policy interventions in the EU context.
Proposals should build links and capitalise on the results of past and ongoing relevant projects, e.g., Horizon 2020 EFUA and the New European Bauhaus (NEB) in urban food system transformation.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-COMMUNITIES-01-6, Inclusive and smart ways to communicate sustainability of food,4/12/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.50-1,"Expected Outcome: This topic is in line with the European Green Deal priorities and the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, as well as of the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050. This will contribute to the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities and thriving businesses.
This topic contributes to creating a sustainable food labelling framework to empower consumers to make sustainable food choices as part of the farm to fork strategy.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhanced understanding of the status of consumer information expectations/needs (conscious and unconscious) related to all three dimensions of sustainability and its drivers and challenges, including the influence of external factors and socio-cultural aspects;
?	Identified best means of transmission and presentations of sustainability related information to guide and change consumer behaviour.
Scope: The sustainability food labelling framework can help consumers in making sustainable food choices. An improved understanding of the drivers of food choices and the role of sustainability can support in using EU and national policy makers and government actions and funds most efficiently and using the best approaches . Information itself may not be enough to change citizens? perception and actions, it should be addressed ?in the right way? (emotional cues?etc.) and consider their current knowledge and information needs. Citizens? food choices, although frequently characterized as a matter of personal choice, are subjective largely by food environments  and there is a need to understand the influence of marketing and media as part of the environment, sometimes creating adverse effects .
Proposals are expected to address the following:
?	Analyse the impact of different influential factors, such as norms/beliefs/cultural environments as well as medias and their way of communicating on the consumer understanding of sustainability, emotional beliefs and response to sustainability information including issues of trust and reliability;
?	Analyse the status of consumer information expectations/needs (conscious and unconscious) related to sustainability and understand how sustainability related information expectations/needs can be increased/developed as well as their drivers and challenges;
?	Test different means of transmission (including different actors sharing information (private vs public)) and presentations of sustainability related information to guide and change consumer behaviour best (including increased willingness to pay for sustainable products and services);
?	Test the response of the public to information related to at least two dimensions of sustainability, including aspects that cover the whole food chain, such as for example biodiversity, packaging or composting, locally produced products;
?	Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-3: The role of mainstream media, social media and marketing in fostering healthy and sustainable consumption patterns and how to encourage good practice or incentives?;

The successful proposal will also contribute to the Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities.
The overall aim of this topic and associated R&I activities is to leverage the New European Bauhaus  values for urban and peri-urban food system transformation by positively transforming the food environment  to enable sustainable, inclusive, and aesthetic ways of food system transformation.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all following expected outcomes:
?	Positively transformed food environments that enhance sustainable food system transformation by applying the vision of New European Bauhaus (NEB) to ?call on all Europeans to imagine and build together a sustainable and inclusive future that is beautiful for our eyes, minds, and souls?;
?	Reconnected and engaged citizens with nature and healthy and sustainable food for their well-being and health while providing multifunctional benefits, such as biodiversity.
Scope: Sustainable food systems can be an integral part of our living spaces including urban gardens, rooftop gardens and other nature-based solutions and positively transform our food environments. Exploiting the vision of New European Bauhaus and providing inclusive access, education and capacity building can provide multi-functional benefits and help transforming food systems especially in urban and peri-urban areas.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
?	Involve all three core values of NEB: 1) sustainability, 2) aesthetics/quality of experience, 3) inclusion, for transforming food environments and contribute to a green and sustainable infrastructure;
?	Expand food environments by using architecture/local place-based approaches for innovative solutions, including art, for current and future needs linked to sustainable food environments and stronger citizen connection to food and empowered self-provisioning communities with multi-functional nature-based solutions (e.g., urban gardens connected to parks, edible trees and bushes, edible green infrastructure?etc.);

Project results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	Improved understanding by policy makers at different levels (European, national, regional and local) of the behavioural drivers of people?s lifestyle choices and rural and urban dwellers? perceptions of rural life in the aftermath of COVID 19;
?	Improve understanding of policy makers at different levels (European, national, regional and local) of the behavioural and structural drivers of people?s lifestyle choices and people?s perceptions of rural life in the aftermath of COVID 19 and of the long-term trends and opportunities for rural areas;
?	Improved policy-response to rural areas challenges and needs in the light of the COVID 19 impact;
Improved narrative of rural and farming lives.
Scope: Rural areas are often described by the challenges they face: depopulation, demographic change, low income levels, limited access to services, low connectivity, discontent caused by the feeling of being overlooked and limited resilience. However, rural areas can be places of opportunities . For instance, they are key for green-energy production and for ecosystem services; they have the potential of developing the bio and circular economy; they are also an integral part of the ecological and digital transitions; they can also be places rich in terms of cultural heritage and have the potential to develop cultural initiatives.
Overall, there are increasing demands from the society that are putting pressure on rural areas and the Covid-19 crisis showed how important it is to keep essential services, e.g. the agri-food production that is an important part of the rural economies, active.
To better respond to rural areas needs and challenges, and to revert the negative trends that affect the well-being of rural communities, it is important to better understand how rural life is perceived by urban and rural dwellers and to build a new narrative, based on facts, that highlight the opportunities of these places.
Projects funded under this topic are expected to:
?	undertake sociological, behavioural, social psychology, social science, history, geographical, cultural, gender, economic studies on societal perception of rural areas and rural lifestyles, including, but not limiting to, societal perception of farming in a variety of places across Europe;
?	increase understanding of the drivers of the attractiveness of rural and farming lives and of corresponding criticisms and biases, including the social composition of flows (e.g. age, gender, nationality, economic status, etc.), a geography of departure and destination zones, distinguishing between perceptions and facts, and both from rural people and urban people (including perception of various farming sectors and practices);
?	analyse how these drivers have been affected by COVID 19 and are likely to evolve, in the short to long-term (2050) (e.g. economic and trade evolution, new ways of working, multi-local living and second homes, zero pollution, health risks etc.);
?	analyse social relations and possible conflicts between new populations and residents, the possible decomposition of social segregation or social mixing;
?	identify the policy and financial consequences for local jurisdictions of both new arrivals and depopulation in terms for instance, of public infrastructures sizing (e.g., water treatment, waste management), real estate markets and housing, public services, etc.
?	analyse initiatives aiming at shifting perceptions of both urban and rural dwellers on rural and farming lives and pilot new initiatives (e.g. on rural attractiveness for young people also beyond agriculture) in different localities across Europe;
?	use foresight (e.g., scenarios, build on trend analysis and disruptive factors, weak signals) to develop adequate strategies to mitigate threats and seize opportunities;
?	contribute to build a positive narrative of rural and farming lives based on facts.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social science and humanities (SSH) disciplines (e.g., sociology, history, human geography behavioural sciences, gender studies, etc.).",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-01-3," Participation and empowerment of Arctic coastal, local, and indigenous communities in environmental decision-making",2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Proposals should contribute to the sustainable and inclusive development of Arctic coastal, local and indigenous communities, supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal and the EU policy for a peaceful, sustainable and prosperous Arctic, incorporating a better understanding of the environmental, socio-economic, cultural and demographic drivers of change in the Arctic region.
Activities are expected to empower Arctic coastal, local and indigenous people to act for change through capacity building and education actions, leading to positive long-term prospects for all, including women, young people and vulnerable groups.
The research should explore and document traditional environmental knowledge (TEK) of Arctic coastal, local and indigenous peoples, contributing thus to safeguarding and valuing the cultural identity of the Arctic; explore interactions between local and indigenous knowledge holders and scientists and develop innovative ways to mobilise this knowledge for climate change adaptation, ecosystem restoration and socio-economic goals.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Better understanding of how different types of knowledge, including traditional environmental knowledge (TEK) , are being mobilised; how scientists and local and indigenous knowledge holders cooperate and dialogue in this context;
?	Empowerment of Arctic coastal, local and indigenous people and sectors to innovate  for the ecological transition and feel part of it, through participatory methodologies (i.e. a multi-actor approach); to engage in decision-making about their environment and livelihoods;
?	Explore, with different actors, and recommend ways to bring traditional, local, and scientific knowledge into the collective effort of solving matters of concern, including (choose at least 2 from the items below):
-Adaptation and mitigation to climate change, ecosystem restoration and environment protection;
-Socio-economic changes in the Arctic, ranging from local level (subsistence economies, local livelihoods) to circular economy, fishing, international trade, shipping routes, tourism, and the socio-economic impact of climate change;
-Health and well-being, taking a One Health approach ;
-Gender aspects, in the context of current economic and social development and future challenges, inter alia relating to climate and environmental issues.
Scope: Addressing ongoing Arctic environmental and societal changes requires that all relevant knowledge, indigenous/traditional and scientific knowledge alike, is mobilised to respond and govern the challenges posed by those changes, and communities empowered to take part in environmental decision-making.
Proposals are expected to contribute to sustainable and inclusive development, incorporating a better understanding of the environmental, socio-economic, cultural and demographic drivers of change. They will investigate the participation of indigenous and local communities in the governance of their livelihoods and environmental decision-making. Proposals should explore how different ways of knowing, worldviews and perspectives can be brought in dialogue, to enhance understanding and to better respond to the impacts of climate, environmental and related socio-economic changes on Arctic people?s livelihoods and the environment. Furthermore, how coastal, local, and indigenous communities could be empowered via participatory research processes, to get involved in environmental decision-making. Proposals should identify opportunities for partnerships and co-production of knowledge based on indigenous and scientific ways of knowing.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-02-1-two-stage, Innovating for climate-neutral rural communities by 2050,2/22/2024,IA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal will contribute to fostering a sustainable, balanced, equitable and inclusive development of rural areas, supporting the implementation of the long-term vision for the EU?s rural areas and its objectives (in particular contributing to stronger and resilient rural areas) and to its flagship initiative ?Research and innovation for rural communities?, the European Green Deal, in particular the climate pact, the fit for 55 package, the forest and biodiversity strategies, and the new soil strategy as well as the territorial agenda 2030, the common agricultural policy (CAP) and the REPowerEU plan. In addition, proposals will complement the EU Mission Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities, covering sparsely populated areas, and contribute to the objectives of the EU Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of following expected outcomes:
?	rural communities are empowered and engaged in the green transition and equipped with strategies and innovative solutions to contribute to EU?s climate-neutrality objectives (by 2035 and 2050) and benefit from a climate-neutral economy;
?	rural communities take advantage of data, interoperable platforms and digital technologies available to help them meet climate-neutrality objectives, such as dashboards, data visualisation techniques, modelling, digital twins of entire rural communities and tools contributing to spatial planning;
?	policy makers are better informed about policy and regulatory frameworks, conditions and processes that are likely to encourage rural areas? climate-neutrality while sustaining an adequate social welfare and well-being and avoiding negative social, economic and environmental externalities;
?	a stronger rural innovation ecosystem is in place bringing together public and private players and making rural areas an attractive place for innovators to work and live.
Scope: The EU aims to be climate-neutral by 2050 ? an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. This objective is in line with the EU?s commitment to global climate action under the Paris Agreement and it is reflected in the European Green Deal objectives. Considering that approximately one third of EU citizens live in rural areas, which represent 83% of the EU territory, it is key to empower rural communities to transit towards sustainability by fostering innovation in key areas such as environment and sustainable management of resources (air, soil, water), energy, transport, agriculture, industry, bioeconomy, and finance and ensure that no one is left behind.
Projects funded under this topic are expected to:
?	design, prototype and test concrete innovations (technical, social, organisational) supporting climate-neutrality, zero pollution and biodiversity enhancement in rural communities, possibly including initiatives such as nature-based solutions (NBS), circularity and bioeconomy, bio-based solutions, community-energy systems, climate-neutral mobility, fire-prevention, etc. Innovations should be co-created with rural stakeholders to respond to their needs and tested for their feasibility for the territorial development opportunities or drawbacks that they bring;
?	include training and capacity building for local administrations and rural stakeholders in order to create and maintain a rural innovation ecosystem and enable them to make use or benefit from the successful innovations developed and from existing funding opportunities for the green and digital transitions;
?	boost networking and enhance peer-to-peer learning between communities and capitalise on lessons learnt making them available as recommendations for policy makers at various levels (European, national, regional and local);
Proposals are encouraged to fully exploit and build complementarities with the ongoing work regarding the establishment of the European Open Science Cloud and interact with relevant projects developing metadata standards and added value tools to ensure interoperability within and across fields of study.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH), (e.g., for expertise in behavioural change, etc.) and must implement the multi-actor approach by involving relevant stakeholders from an early stage (e.g. rural communities representatives, small-medium enterprises -SMEs, etc., end-users, local authorities, etc.).
Proposals should cover various biogeographical regions with a balanced coverage reflecting the various pedo-climatic zones in Europe in a representative way.
Proposals are expected to build on the preliminary results of the Horizon Europe projects GRANULAR and RUSTIK, in particular its framework and indicators on climate-neutrality of rural communities.
Proposals should also create synergies and coordinate activities with the other project funded under this topic and should allocate appropriate budget for this task. Proposals are also encouraged to build synergies with relevant projects that will be financed under this call",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-02-2-two-stage, New sustainable business and production models for farmers and rural communities,2/22/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,17-Sep-24,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal should support the European Green Deal initiatives notably the farm to fork, the forest, biodiversity and bioeconomy strategies, the common agricultural policy (CAP), the communication on sustainable carbon cycles, the EU mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?, and the long-term vision for the EU?s rural areas (contributing to make rural areas stronger, connected, resilient and prosperous) and its research and innovation flagship initiative by developing innovative business and production models (i.e. but not limited to, smart farming, social farming, indoor plant factory, aquaponics, unattended horticulture, livestock and fish farms, e-commerce, tourism, cultural and natural heritage management, service delivery) that are fit for the future and foster improved economic outcomes, cooperation, inclusiveness and fairness for farmers and/or rural communities, and at the same time achieve high sustainability, contribute to climate neutrality and meet societal expectations, in particular with regards to local economies and protection and restoration of nature and resources (e.g. water, soil and air).
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Farmers and/or other rural actors widely adopt innovative inclusive and sustainable business and production models that enhance and remunerate climate action (i.e. increase carbon removals), biodiversity protection and restoration, and the reduction of emissions or concentrations of air pollutants in a variety of farming and rural contexts;
?	Farmers and/or rural actors position in value chains is improved thanks to more inclusiveness, fairness and financial sustainability of trading relationships between the various actors in the upstream/downstream agri and rural business;
?	It is possible to measure and track the economic, social and environmental sustainability of different farming systems and rural businesses thanks to the development and use of innovative technologies, including but not limiting to digital ones.
?	Increased prosperity of farmers and/or in rural areas thanks to the creation of new jobs opportunities resulted from innovative and sustainable production and business models.
Scope: EU agri-food value chains are diverse and dynamic, enabling them to meet the various consumers? expectations, potentially helping producers increase value added. Farming and other sectors in rural areas provide large numbers of jobs, yet rural communities often face challenges, such as a shrinking and ageing population, a lack of high qualified workers, a lack of good quality services and connectivity, which limit the economic attractiveness of these places.
At the same time agriculture is characterised by a stagnant and low share of value added in the value chain due to: high input costs, structure of the food value chains (concentration upstream and downstream), variation in production and incorporation of new services. Pressure on natural resources and climate change threats make all of the above-mentioned problems weigh more heavily. In an era of very tense discussions on climate change, global warming, air, water and soil pollution the EU stands firmly as a front-runner and targets the very ambitious goal of becoming a climate-neutral continent by 2050. This target seems very challenging when looking at where we stand today and the pace at which expected changes across different sectors are taking place.
Therefore, rural communities as well as farmers are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable business and production models that consider not only economic but also both social and environmental aspects. Moving towards more sustainable business and production systems requires adequate tools and measurement methods to assess and monitor the multi-performance of farms and rural businesses under different conditions.
Successful proposals are expected to clearly address only one of the following areas: area A or area B.
Area A
Proposals should:
?	Design, test and upscale bottom-up community-led innovative business, cooperation and production models to improve farmers? position in different value chains and enable them to transition to sustainable agriculture and answer global challenges in locally adapted ways. They should cover a wide diversity of pedoclimatic, technical, organisational and economic conditions, including the complexity and dynamics in various production systems and structure of food value chains (additional sustainability requirements for farmers might lead to further unbalances in market power in the food chain).
?	Investigate ways to monitor and verify improved social, environmental and climate performance and translate it into economic profit and competitive advantage for farmers. They should consider existing, emerging and potential markets and platforms, take into consideration sound cost-effective business, cooperation among different actors and production methods, sustainability and profitability.
?	Investigate the trends in adoption of innovation in farms and how farmers innovate their business, cooperation or production models when they introduce new products and engage in new business activities.
Aim to connect citizens, private companies and public organisations with farmers to increase demand for sustainable agriculture and create a market for new business, cooperation and production models including for, but not limited to, e-commerce, smart farming, indoor plant factory, aquaponics, unattended horticulture, livestock and fish farms. Traceability for products and standards for safety and quality should also be taken into account.
?	Create and widely share via an open access platform practical innovations, tools, best practices and guidelines to successfully develop and implement novel inclusive and sustainable business, cooperation and production models.
?	Investigate and support the wide-spread applications of highly scalable business models for modern agricultural purposes including aspects of platform, circular and bio-based economies.
?	Consideration should be given to innovative approaches in the development of production technologies, the circularity of the processes with the objective of zero waste, cascading of resources and consider public health as well as consumers' concerns and demands.
Area B
Proposals are expected to:
?	Pilot innovative sustainable business and cooperation models to foster wealth and well-being of rural communities and villages while taking advantage of the green transition though the deployment of demonstrators. These demonstrators should be implemented in various sectors (i.e. but not limited to energy, transport, social services, tourism, culture, digital, etc.) responding to rural communities? needs.
?	Investigate the potential of social economy, cooperatives (or other producer organisations) and of innovative forms of business aggregation and develop at least one of these demonstrators that support local economy by actively involving people in a vulnerable situation.
?	Explore and take advantage of cross-sectoral and cross-territory linkages adopting a territorial perspective that aims at improving connectivity of rural areas with surrounding intermediate and urban areas.
?	Examine the impacts of different kind of innovation on the development and revitalisation of rural areas and the quality of life and living standards of their residents.
?	Identify barriers, as well as drivers (including policies) and enabling conditions for the creation and development of sustainable business models in rural areas.
?	Provide recommendations to policy makers, at the local, regional, national and international levels for supporting the creation of sustainable business models fit for the future with the aim to increase quality public services, to make better use of various resources and reduce negative impact on the environment, and that provide new opportunities for rural value chains through different models of innovation.
?	Create and widely share via an open access platform practical innovations, tools, best practices and guidelines to successfully develop and implement novel inclusive and sustainable business models.
?	Proposals should cover a representative variety of rural areas.
All proposals (independent of the selected focus A or B) should explore social innovation and innovative forms of cooperation. Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of relevant actors of the value chain.
This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines. Proposals should build on previous and ongoing Horizon 2020 relevant projects (i.e. but not limited to SMARTCHAIN, NEWBIE, agroBRIDGES, CO-FRESH, RUBIZMO, LIVERUR, etc.). They should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the other project funded under this and other relevant topics in Horizon Europe and ensure synergy with relevant activities carried out under other initiatives (i.e. but not limited to EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities, Enterprise Europe Network, Circular Bio-based Europe public-private partnership, etc.).
Beyond open access to scientific publications and research data, open access to software, models, workflows, etc. is required to ensure accelerated uptake of innovation, increase research transparency, support immediate and extensive re-use of research materials, and support collaborative and interdisciplinary work, among others.
Due to the scope of this topic, international cooperation is strongly encouraged, in particular with China. This topic is within the scope of the Administrative Arrangement between the European Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People?s Republic of China on a Co-funding Mechanism for the period 2021-2024 to support collaborative research projects under the Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) and the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) flagship initiatives.
Actions will contribute to implementing the EU-China Food, Agriculture and Biotechnology (FAB) flagship initiative, which aims to ensure sustainability of agri-food systems, catering for the needs of a growing population, the reduction of food and agricultural losses and waste, and the provision of safe and healthy foodstuffs. Interaction with other actions developed under the EU-China Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Research Flagship and the Flagship on Food, Agriculture and Biotechnologies (FAB) is encouraged if relevant",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-1, European partnership of Agriculture of Data,3/23/2023,COFUND,12/22/2022,,,Around 40.00-1,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will contribute to the objectives of the Agriculture of Data partnership proposal including the strategic research and innovation agenda. This partnership aims to enhance climate, environmental and socio-economic sustainability and productivity of agriculture and to strengthen policy monitoring and evaluation capacities through exploiting the potential of Earth and environmental observation and other data, in combination with data technologies.
Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes (as listed in the partnership document ):
?	Increased sharing and harmonisation of data across different actors (e.g. scientists, technicians, policymakers, practitioners, businesses, farmers, end users) and countries based to the extent possible on FAIR   data principles, and exploitation of synergies through better integration of the digital Earth, environmental observation, space observation and agricultural communities within Europe, transforming both the R&I and economic systems to deliver more and better data-based solutions to the end users;
?	Increased environmental, climate and socio-economical sustainability performance of the agriculture sector;
?	Enhanced contribution from the agriculture sector to the important need for protecting the environment, halting and, if possible, reversing biodiversity loss in Europe and globally, as well as to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture;
?	Enabling the sector and strengthen its capacity to adapt to climate change and to meet the objectives set by sustainability-related policies, considering e.g. risk analyses/indicators, such as environmental, technical, economic or social risks;
?	Contribution to creating structures and/or its concept under the umbrella of the partnership Agriculture of Data that includes data infrastructure needed to provide data-based solutions for both policy-making and the agriculture sector (including to strengthening the sector?s economic performance);
?	Strengthened capacities to evaluate the effectiveness of policies (with reference to agriculture, environmental- and market-related policies and the combined potential effects of them).
Scope: Sustainable agricultural production and policy monitoring needs can be supported through the provision of tailored data and data-based solutions; especially, through Earth/environmental observation and in combination with other data and data technologies. At the same time, the agricultural sector at farm level produces data during digitalised farming practises, as also does the public administration. This data can be capitalised to strengthen capacities of the agricultural sector in the public and the private domains. Integrating different sources of data, for instance Copernicus  data, precision farming data, Integrated Administration Control System (IACS )-data and other reference data, would lead to even more relevant information in this context and provide scope for the development, delivery and uptake of agri-digitalisation products and services, such as decision-making support systems.
Proposals should pool the necessary financial resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes with a view to implementing joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties.
The successful proposal should:
?	Exploit the potential of public and private data, including in the combination with data technologies (including AI) for the agricultural sector in the public and private domain;
?	Build on results of existing (ongoing or finished) initiatives and projects;
?	Foster EU-wide solutions, scaling up  of use-cases and applications close to deployment stage;
?	Develop data-based solutions and digital applications in support of achieving the expected impacts of the partnership;
?	Consider the necessary technical systemic elements related to e.g. digital and data infrastructure and interoperability;
?	Demonstrate how the expected result contribute to the European Green Deal objectives and the ambition of better policy-making ;
?	Demonstrate how it will align to the ongoing work of the Horizon Europe partnership on Agriculture of Data and the projects granted under call HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-11: Upscaling (real-time) sensor data for EU-wide monitoring of production and agri-environmental conditions .
A successful proposal is expected to explore the potential for achieving synergies with relevant topics/ projects, partnerships and/ or missions particularly within Cluster 6 and Cluster 4 of the Horizon Europe programme, as well as with the digital Europe programme, the EU space programme and the common agricultural policy.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-2, Advancing analytical capacity and tools to support EU agri-food policies post 2027,3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal, the European Commission aims at more sustainable food systems that reduce their negative impact on climate change and biodiversity loss, while ensuring that farmers and consumers can benefit from it and our long-term food security and public health. Successful proposals will advance analytical capacity and tools to support future evidence-based policies to accelerate the transition to sustainable food systems. While the focus is on agri-food policies, European Green Deal actions relating to climate and environment should also be integrated in the assessment/approaches where relevant.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved analytical capacity and tools (including models) to assess short-term and long-term impacts of future EU agri-food policies on food systems (and on their actors);
?	Enhanced evidence-based knowledge supporting analysis and design of agri-food policies.
Scope: Various studies recently published, analysed the possible effects of some elements of the farm to fork and biodiversity strategies on EU agriculture . The studies provide both the scientific community and policymakers with a valuable insight on the choice of policy tools to minimize trade-offs and maximise synergies between the impacts. However, the models used in the studies all have their limitations. They do not comprehensively address all the components of the European Green Deal in order to adequately support policy analysis. In view of that, the proposals should address these limitations and:
?	Build and/or advance analytical capacity to support the quantitative assessment of impacts of future agri-food policies on economic, social (including health), environmental and climate sustainability of food systems;
?	Address the modelling gaps that were not taken into account in previous studies184 to enable analyses of the effects of the agri-food policies on sustainability (including public health) of food systems under diverse scenarios, with particular attention to trade-offs and synergies that they may entail in order to improve policy coherence;
?	Further develop, expand and improve the models covered under iMAP, also by exploiting linkages and integrations with other models. New approaches should be developed for further advancing the state of the art by modelling, e.g., input use and costs, uptake of new knowledge, practices and innovations, supply chains, consumer behavioural changes, circular economy, health care system, public health, etc.
?	Particular attention should be given to capturing shifts in supply and demand, and feedback loops throughout the food system ? upstream and downstream of agriculture. Further advancing the state of the art by modelling, e.g., input use and costs, uptake of new knowledge, practices and innovations, supply chains, consumer behavioural changes, circular economy, etc. Linkages between economic and bio-physical models should be improved.
?	Moreover, alternative quantitative approaches to modelling should be developed, especially for improving the capacity to assess:
o	interrelations (e.g., absence of pure and perfect competition) and impacts on different actors across the food systems, e.g., farmers, SMEs, consumer, food supply chains, etc.;
o	nature-based approaches, cost of no action, biomass balance, etc.
?	Collaborate and complement the projects funded under Horizon 2020 (e.g., SFS-49-2017: SUPREMA ; RUR-03-2018: CONSOLE, Contract2.0 and EFFECT; RUR 04-2018-2019: Mind Step, BESTMAP, AGRICORE and BATModel) and Horizon Europe (e.g., BrightSpace and LAMASUS).
?	Guide long-term model developments, identify new potential interesting models, preserve and build stable bridges between models, integrate models and enable improved multi-disciplinary research related to the European Green Deal or other relevant future policy initiatives.
?	Ensure consistency with modelling tools used to monitor and evaluate environmental and climate policies in related fields (e.g. emissions and removals in LULUCF and agriculture sectors for greenhouse gas inventories).
This project requires a multi-disciplinary approach/teams encompassing economics, environment and climate, health and other social policies.
It is key also to establish a regular dialogue with the European Commission regarding objectives, timeline and main deliverables with the goal to provide analytical tools and evidence-based knowledge to support implementation and future developments of agri-food policies, notably the common agricultural policy (CAP) post 2027 and the future EU legal framework for sustainable food systems.
Collaboration with the JRC is strongly encouraged. The possible participation of the JRC in the project will ensure that the approach proposed will advance jointly the state of the art, and be compatible and effectively integrated with the tools used at the European Commission. Project duration should not be shorter than four years",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-3, Towards CAP post 2027:  evidence on nudging farmers to leverage more sustainable practices and behaviours,3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal, notably the farm to fork and EU biodiversity strategies, the fit for 55 legislative package, the EU action plan: 'towards zero pollution for air, water and soil' and the common agricultural policy (CAP), the successful proposals should support the development of policies, business models and market conditions that enable sustainable, productive and climate-neutral agricultural systems. The farming systems should provide consumers with healthy and sustainable food affordable for all, improving public health, minimising pressure on and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services, contributing to climate neutrality, and generating fair economic returns for farmers.
Proposals results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Innovative green nudges efficiently contribute to move farmers and foresters towards more sustainable practices that enhance climate action (i.e. reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase carbon removals), biodiversity protection and restoration, and the reduction of emissions or concentrations of air pollutants;
?	Models of social innovation and innovative co-operation along the value chains which nudge farmers and foresters towards more sustainable behaviours;
?	New effective nudging solutions are provided to policymakers to better address sustainability goals;
?	Green nudges are used to complement environmental, food and bioeconomy policies towards more sustainable and circular production systems;
?	New policies are designed taking into account farmers? environmental attitudes, risk aversion, inequality aversion, cognitive strategies and the importance of non-monetary benefits.
Scope: According to the prediction of the Food and Agriculture Organization, food supply must increase by almost 70% by 2050, with tremendous consequences in terms of land depletion, natural capital and resource use, and greenhouse gas emissions. The current agri-food system is inadequate to the need to cope with this increased demand while also preserving the environment.  Although the EU has made strides in improving the sustainability of agriculture, substantial efforts are still needed to achieve the ambitious targets of the European Green Deal, in particular the bioeconomy strategy, EU farm to fork and biodiversity strategies 2030, the communication on sustainable carbon cycles, farm to fork strategy, circular economy action plan (CEAP) and the objectives of the 2023-2027 CAP. The common agricultural policy is a key tool to achieve a sustainable transformation, and it puts farmers at the core of its actions. We currently know very little about the role of behavioural factors in determining farmers choices and whether non-pecuniary mechanism, such as policy nudge , can be used effectively in policy design. Evidence about the adoption of nudging tools in promoting environmentally sustainable practices along the food supply chain, including the role of circular bio-based options , are still relatively sparse. In particular, nudges that have been proved to work efficiently on the consumer side (e.g., default nudges, social norm nudges, choice architecture) do not translate well to farmers, and farmers may respond to nudges in a heterogeneous manner, based on their specificities .
An in-depth understanding of farmers? nudges is key to spurring large-scale and lasting shifts to sustainable farming systems.
Proposals should take a comprehensive behavioural approach and investigate proximal and distal factors to better understand farmers? behaviour in decision-making, in order to inform the design and implementation of EU policies (in particular the CAP) and the European Green Deal initiatives with particular focus on farm to fork, biodiversity strategies and climate action.
Proposals should:
?	Investigate whether green nudges are able to generate robust and durable behavioural change in farmers and foresters and look into existing and efficient nudging practices in agriculture and forestry sectors to create best practices and develop recommendations for EU policymakers on nudging in public policies of concern for farmers and foresters.
?	Investigate, identify and test innovative nudging practices to help farmers and foresters move into sustainable farming systems, also considering behavioural factors that could influence farmers/foresters deciding or not to engage in these practices.
?	Investigate these behavioural factors and identify innovative tools to enlarge knowledge in this field and to improve farmers and foresters? self-regulatory capacity. Test appropriate policy mechanisms for incorporating the perception of farmers and foresters in decision-making and assess the potential for upscaling innovative nudging practices.
?	Create policy recommendations to the decision-makers, including to the AKIS Coordination Bodies in member States, to adapt and tailor CAP AKIS interventions accordingly.
Proposals should explore social innovation and innovative forms of cooperation, including multi-stakeholder/multi-actor partnerships along the value chains, as well as how interactions within value chains/sectors contribute to or hinder the adoption of relevant sustainability-oriented innovations. The proposals are expected to use the multi actor approach. See definition of the multi-actor approach in the introduction to this Work Programme part.
The JRC participation could involve contributing to the investigation, identification and design of nudging practices and eventually participate in the testing phase in one country.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this or other topics (i.e. but not limited to projects funded under topic HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-08)

HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-4, Developing an interdisciplinary and inclusive pan-European academic network for food system science,3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 6.00-1,"
Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food system, the Food 2030 priorities and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will contribute to the transformation and sustainability of EU food systems by supporting the establishment of innovative governance models notably to achieve better-informed decision-making processes and facilitate inter- and transdisciplinary research methods.
Successful proposals will develop an interdisciplinary and inclusive pan-European academic network for food system science that integrates the social sciences and humanities (SSH), design, engineering and natural and applied sciences. Central to the work of the academic network is the concept of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). In particular, successful proposals will set out how the network and its members can work to improve and/or develop: new methods and tools, data access and knowledge sharing, inter- and transdisciplinary research and the assessment of impacts in complex and interconnected food systems. The network will act as a European building block in fostering improved food system governance at all scales and will connect with related key international fora. By deepening engagement amongst researchers, scientific disciplines and science performers, this initiative will build capacity to strengthen the role of science and knowledge for sustainable food systems transition in Europe and beyond.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Establish a broad pan-European interdisciplinary academic network.
?	Foster inter-, transdisciplinary, participatory, policy and regulatory research to develop new insights, findings, models, methods and tools to assess and manage the full systemic complexity of food systems.
?	A strengthened European Research Area for sustainable food systems transformation for co-benefits, which federates a wide diversity of scientific actors across Europe, promotes gender equality in research, attracts young talents and fosters inclusiveness and cooperation across scientific disciplines, and promotes education and outreach.
?	Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and Food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Scope: Food systems face the triple challenge of providing food security and nutrition for a growing global population, and livelihoods to farmers (OECD, 2021).  To meet these challenges, a food system transformation is needed to make the EU food system future-proof, in line with the farm to fork strategy and the European Commission?s food 2030 initiative.
The project will build an interdisciplinary and inclusive pan-European academic network for food system science, that will integrate the social sciences and humanities, design, engineering and natural and applied sciences. The aim of the network is to federate research performers including universities, national science academies and research centres, academics and researchers across Europe to work together on sustainable food systems transition by carrying out inter- and transdisciplinary research, developing and applying new methods, models and tools, improving data and knowledge sharing, fostering debate and providing advice to policy makers for improved decision-making at all levels ? from global to local, as needed.
Proposed activities should cover all of the following aspects:
?	Establish a broad pan-European interdisciplinary network of researchers, scientists, and research performers including national science academies, universities and research centres representing diverse and interconnected food systems-related disciplines.
?	The network will conduct different types of research: inter-, transdisciplinary and participatory research, as well as policy/regulatory research.
?	Interdisciplinary research activities will develop new systems science insights, models, methods and tools to assess and manage the full systemic complexity of food systems, their multiple drivers and dynamics, with the aim of providing research outcomes that deliver co-benefits and minimise adverse effects. The research will also increase understanding of how food systems interact with other bioeconomy demands on biological resources (e.g., energy system, bio-based industry, climate mitigation and adaptation, supply of ecosystem services, etc.).
?	Transdisciplinary and participatory research activities will foster collaboration with different food systems stakeholders (e.g., public authorities, local and regional communities, civil society organisations, the private sector, consumers, etc.) to identify knowledge gaps, high priority research needs, and collaborative responses to them. This may include the organization of iterative stakeholder workshops, interviews, questionnaires and the collaboration with existing or future food policy/living labs.
?	Policy and regulatory research activities will be designed to provide evidence to support systemic policy and decision making, as needed. In this respect, research is welcome on how to transition to a true cost of food that adequately embeds social and environmental externalities at all levels (global to local).
?	Building on the RTD/2020/SC/022 study ?Promote education, training and skills across the bioeconomy?, the network will develop open access educational material/curricula to be used by Higher Education Institutes to help strengthen their existing food systems-related teaching and research with an inter- and transdisciplinary systems dimension.
?	Support the training, mobility, mutual learning and knowledge sharing amongst researchers (including masters to post-doc levels) and foster open science approaches that also accelerate gender equality, attract young talents, foster inclusiveness and reuse of research knowledge (including the sharing of FAIR and open digital research or educational output). This will also include the organization of a high-level annual summer camp/school providing inter- and transdisciplinary food systems and bioeconomy science training open to youth from all over Europe.
?	Organise an international bi-annual conference dedicated to advancing integrated food systems science. In this context special attention will be placed on awarding excellence amongst young researchers, including young women researchers.
?	Establish a high-level liaison with EU and relevant international initiatives acting at the science-policy interface for improved food systems governance.
?	Proposals are encouraged to cooperate with actors such as the European Commission?s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The JRC may provide expertise on how to strengthen the relationship between scientists and European policy makers and to promote research and collaboration on food systems science.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with the projects funded under the work programme from WP2021-2022, namely HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-02 (FOSTER, Fostering food system transformation by integrating heterogeneous perspectives in knowledge and innovation within the ERA) and with the living labs and lighthouses foreseen under the Horizon Europe Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?. Projects should also build on the findings of the European Commission?s High Level Expert Group (HLEG) that addressed needs and options to strengthen the international science policy interface for improved global food system governance.
Collaboration and complementary with the European Partnership on ?Sustainable Food Systems for People, Plant and Climate? is encouraged. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.

Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Support to the EuroGEO  community, including supporting and cooperating with the EuroGEO Action Groups, on innovation and services and where possible link with existing and future the GEO/EuroGEO infrastructure components;
?	Establishment of organisational support, e.g., coordination of EuroGEO communication activities and events. This includes the increase of synergies among EU funded projects in the context of environmental observations and other topics related to EuroGEO, providing a solid base for evidence-informed allocation of EU research funding through sound monitoring of ongoing research funding activities in Europe and beyond;
?	A more developed and better monitored execution of the EuroGEO Implementation Plan in the GEO Work Programme and visibility and exposure to European lead Flagships and Initiatives in the global GEO WP - linking their thematic products and services to relevant European Policy priorities.

?	Assistance to the development of a sustainability concept for the EuroGEO initiative;
?	Further developed research policies, guidelines and where possible standards in close relation with the EC Knowledge Centre on Earth Observation ;
Scope: This action aims to prepare the transition of the existing EuroGEO initiative into a sustainable endeavour, by setting up a secretariat.
The successful proposal should propose actions for the secretariat to:
?	Further strengthen and promote the three EuroGEO priorities: combining, cooperating and coordinating;
?	Serve as the basis for evidence-informed allocation of research funding by monitoring ongoing research funding activities in Europe and beyond;
?	Provide professional support in organising EuroGEO events and meetings of EuroGEO bodies (Coordination Group and Action Groups);
?	Guide the dialogue with relevant stakeholders and initiatives and (further) build connections, including raising awareness of and interest in the EuroGEO initiative.
The successful proposal should carry out an in-depth investigation resulting into a sustainability plan offering options for the long-term operationalisation and sustainability of the EuroGEO initiative, with the GEO Member States and GEO Participating Organisations of Europe.
The proposed sustainability plan should include a suggested pathway towards implementation, such as the implementation of a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium (EDIC) .
The organisational and logistical support of a secretariat should maximise the unique and long-term impact of EuroGEO by strengthening Europe's leading role in the successful deployment of Earth Observation applications in the global context.
The maximum duration of the funded project is 24 months",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-11, Reducing observation gaps in the land-sea interface area,3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 9.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal will be contributing to the European Green Deal objectives including the need to address climate change mitigation and adaptation, pollution and biodiversity loss, through up-taking, integrating, further deploying and exploiting environmental observations.
The successful proposal will be contributing to the European strategy for data, the European digital strategy and support Destination Earth with the development of Digital Twins. It will also be contributing to a strengthened Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)  and improvement of data and modelling services provided by European programmes such as Copernicus  - marine, climate, land, and emergency services and the European Marine Observation and Data network (EMODnet)  - and ensure enhanced coordination with ESA relevant activities as part of the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative  and in particular with the activities of the ESA Ocean Science Cluster (oceansciencecluster.esa.int).
The successful proposal is expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Increased availability of integrated in-situ observations at the land-sea interface, with particular emphasis on river mouths, estuaries and deltas in Europe;
?	Improved hydrological, biogeochemical, ecological and coastal modelling based on the integration and combination of these new sources of in-situ observations remote sensing data and their combination at the land-sea interface;
?	Enhanced networking between the relevant observation communities (in-situ, airborne, satellite, citizen science, etc.) and training of the citizen science community in the approach to the observation of the land-sea interface making use of newly developed low-cost instrumentation;
?	Strengthened coordination between Earth observation communities in the land and marine domains, including hydrology, and between the in-situ data collection and satellite ocean communities (e.g., ESA Ocean Science cluster activities), and better integration of observation and modelling science communities working on applications close to shore, to ensure consistency and cross-validation of different types of observations and foster complementarity and enhanced integration into advanced products and multisource information.
Scope: Fit for purpose in-situ Earth observations are essential for understanding environmental systems and assessing feedback loops/impacts in important interfaces, as is the land-sea interface at the coastal zones. Especially through the contribution of satellite data, there are still important gaps to be addressed to integrate in-situ Earth observations from the terrestrial and marine domains. There is a need for increased capacity to assess trans-domain impacts, develop and validate detailed models and forecasting applications in the land-sea interface. In the framework of the Digital Twin Ocean (DTO) and Destination Earth (DestinE) , the development of integrated observation capacities between land and sea, in the coastal zones and beyond, is necessary to address priorities. These can include the decrease of pollution, protection and conservation of biodiversity and prediction/adaptation to climate change effects related to e.g., erosion, to the loss of land and ecosystems, land and coastal marine heatwaves, acidification, storm surges, floods and salinization. Specific attention should be given to the sea effect on coastal lands (loss of land, habitat, soil salinisation, etc.), the lateral flux of carbon from terrestrial to coastal ecosystems and marine carbon stocks at the coast, observations gaps and integration (suitability of land observations to measure impact at sea and vice versa).
Proposals should address the following:
?	Assessment of current in-situ observing capabilities and protocols of the terrestrial and marine domains, including hydrology, with emphasis on the coastal zones and focus on terrestrial/hydrological input to the sea (delta?s, river input, agricultural and other run-off, etc.), including issues of spatial and temporal resolution, identification of important gaps and proposals for viable, long-term approaches to address them;
?	Development of methods, tools, technologies and processes to fill the identified gaps following the assessment and to increase integrated observing capacity in the coastal zones and in the land-sea interface (including hydrological inputs). These developments should also contribute to upgrading, enhancing and interconnecting the existing observing networks, developing new capacity when necessary;
?	Development of interoperability standards between terrestrial and marine data and coordination of existing observation services and networks (EMODnet, Copernicus, GEOSS, WISE, LUCAS, INSPIRE etc.) to promote freely available and uninhibited flows of FAIR  data and to support the creation of data products in the land-sea interface; combination of in-situ observation from land and sea with satellite observation to fill otherwise unaddressed gaps;
?	Advance forecasting and modelling capacity in the coastal zones, including for predicting hazardous events, addressing habitat and biodiversity loss, assessing lateral carbon fluxes across the land ocean continuum, addressing shoreline issues such as erosion, detecting/quantifying/managing the impacts of human activity and extreme events due to climate change, and the better integration of river runoffs into marine-related predictions (including the inflow of plastic and nutrient loads through rivers and estuaries);
?	Developing close coordination and collaboration across scientific communities (e.g., in-situ data, satellite base observations) ensuring data consistency, cross-fertilisation and enhanced data integration.
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science. The EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative enables EC and ESA to support complementary collaborative projects funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe and on the ESA side through the FutureEO programme  .
The applicants under this topic shall enter into contact with the ESA Ocean Science Cluster  of the FutureEO programme, and include in their proposals activities to ensure coordination with ESA relevant actions.
Collaboration with the relevant existing European Research Infrastructures (such as JERICO or Danubius-RI) is highly recommended.
A strong cooperation, through e.g. networking and exchanges of information with relevant projects  and HORIZON-MISSION-2021: ?EU Public Infrastructure for the European Digital Twin Ocean and HORIZON-MISSION-2021-05-01: ?Underlying models for the European Digital Twin Ocean? is expected",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-12," Empowering citizens to monitor, report and act in partnership with relevant public authorities to protect their environment in the context of environmental compliance assurance",3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will be contributing to the wide deployment of, and adding value to, environmental observations for ?environmental compliance assurance? ,  by empowering citizens  to promote, monitor, and act in partnership with relevant public authorities, thus contributing to the European Green Deal objectives (in particular to zero-pollution, protecting biodiversity and preventing deforestation).
Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	An increase in empowered citizens, communities and intermediaries that are equipped with guidance and tools to act on protecting their environment and increase awareness among citizens of environmental compliance;
?	More relevant (in-situ) datasets and information, to be used in the context of policy shaping and the use of geospatial intelligence  for environmental compliance assurance;
?	Tested FAIR data governance and management mechanisms that enable the sharing, community validation and use of citizen generated data and information in combination with authoritative data and information as part of the European Green Deal Data Space;
?	Better/larger engagement of citizens and communities with regional and local authorities to develop local actions for green and digital transformation (e.g., via the Living Labs for green digital solutions ) as well as Living Labs established in Missions, Partnerships and other initiatives .
Scope: Successful proposals are expected to support citizen engagement in particular by encouraging the validation and uptake of citizen observations by relevant public authorities for environmental compliance assurance. This includes the establishment of trusted data governance approaches in the context of the European Green Deal Data Space and, where possible, creating synergies with the citizen science development efforts of the Destination Earth initiative, and with the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) European Partnership.
Capacity building for citizens, communities and intermediaries (training the trainer) to collect data and monitor their environment in addition to the data and information collected by other means of observation (statutory reporting, space-based, airborne, etc.), should be part of the proposal (e.g., through online or local learning and training modules), as well as awareness raising activities on environmental compliance assurance",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-13," Open source solutions for edge, cloud and mixed model applications to strengthen production and administrative capacities in agriculture",3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the farm to fork strategy, the common agricultural policy post 2022, and the headline ambition of a digital age, the European strategy for data  in particular, a successful proposal will contribute to transition to a fair, healthy and resilient agriculture. It will direct and/ or indirectly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance of the sector and competitiveness in agriculture through supporting the further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers through research and innovation.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhanced sustainability performance and competitiveness of the sector, and a strengthened position of producers through tailored open-source digital solutions;
?	Increased and enhanced use of digital tools in areas with weak connectivity;
?	Improved energy balance of data-based solutions used in agricultural production;
?	New approaches towards the development of software for the agriculture contributing to improving operational effectiveness and efficiency in the sector through real- time data processing;
?	Facilitated deployment of digital applications for farmers and actors related to the agricultural sector;
?	Decision-making support, particularly for policymakers, farm advisors, farmers, and public administration.
Scope: Digital and data technologies can improve the sustainability performance and competitiveness of the agricultural sector. There are still a number of factors hampering the uptake of digital technologies by farmers, including a lack of affordability of digital tools, a lack of digital skills and trust in data sharing, scepticism towards the ?black box phenomenon? of digital applications and the lacking transparency in the development of algorithms, and the risk of vendor lock-ins. Digital solutions following the open-source principle can lead to reduced prices for digital applications and enhance transparency in production advice based on digital applications.
One frequent challenge to the use of certain digital technologies in agriculture, especially in remote areas, is weak connectivity, which hampers the full exploitation of their potential. Edge solutions may facilitate real-time applications also in areas with weak connectivity; they may, however, be run with less and/or other input data potentially resulting in another performance than cloud-based solutions or solutions following a mixed model of edge and cloud components. As data storage, processing and transfer goes along with energy consumption, the overall environmental performance of the different models for digital applications also varies and is also influenced by the number of users of a certain application. This factor may influence the choice and or support for a certain digital application in agriculture.
Proposals should address the following:
?	Development of open-source based digital applications for farmers following a dual and comparative approach with edge, cloud and mixed solutions under consideration of the potential of advanced Internet of Things (IoT) solutions; whereby the focus is on (remote) outdoor production processes, where frequently weak connectivity is given, as well as on reducing administrative burden for producers (TRL 5-7).
?	Development of software solutions following an open-source principle involving (semi-professional) close-to-practice IT experts/ farmers and advisors with advanced digital skills to capitalise daily-work experiences and enhance user-orientation and increase digital capacities in the sector (TRL 5-7).
?	Comparison of the performance of edge and cloud solutions in their effectiveness, efficiency and energy performance under consideration of various biogeographic and socio-economic framing conditions at farm and farm community level at regional and national scale.
?	Development of a decision-making support tool, particularly targeting policymakers, farm advisors, farmers, and the public administration facilitating the comparing the performance of edge-, cloud-, and mixed model-based open source solutions for agriculture along several socio-economic and environmental parameters, including administrative capacities needed for their deployment, at the level of the farm, and the farm community at regional national scale.
Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various stakeholder groups, including farmers, farm advisors, IT experts and scientists are well reflected. Proposals should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines. This is required in particular to achieve a high level of user-friendliness of the developed applications and to develop accompanying training material for the different targeted user groups. Proposals are expected to take into consideration the results of other related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects as well as of other relevant EU funded projects and initiatives. When exploring opportunities to reduce administrative burdens for farmers, proposals should consider possibilities to facilitate reporting obligations and use production data for other processes along the value chain, e.g. marketing. Proposals are strongly encouraged to consider (evolving) technical solutions and (forthcoming) requirements  in the field of data interoperability and switchability and to contribute to enhanced interoperability. In order to benefit from the experiences gained in the development of digital applications focused on within this topic and to foster the upscaling of the outreach of the use of the developed digital applications, international cooperation is encouraged.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties e.g. to academic researchers, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs, and other multidisciplinary actors, to, for instance, develop, test or validate developed applications. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted. A maximum of 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose",
HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-14, Digital and data technologies for livestock tracking,3/23/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the farm to fork strategy, the headline ambition of a Digital Age ? the EU data strategy strategy  in particular - and the common agricultural policy (CAP), a successful proposal will support capacities to understand, develop and demonstrate the potential of digital and data technologies for livestock tracking in the public and private domains. It is therefore expected to indirectly support the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture, the development of innovative governance models, and strengthened capacities for implementing, monitoring and evaluating common policies through research and innovation and through interlinking actors and relevant initiatives.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Strengthened sustainable livestock production through increased capabilities for the generation of livestock related data sets (including in the field on animal health and disease prevention);
?	Strengthened the resilience and transparency of supply chains through the use of digital technologies;
?	Enhanced capacities in policy monitoring and evaluation in the field of agriculture, environment, climate, and sustainable finance.
Scope: Data and digital technologies are currently used for many purposes in and for livestock farming, both in the public and private domains. Livestock and its attributes are tracked for instance in the context of implementing the CAP, for disease prevention and mitigation, as well as to facilitate production and the management of supply chains. Sensors, for instance, allow for collecting multiple information, e.g. on health conditions or medical treatments of livestock, location and environmental conditions. They may facilitate, e.g. more tailored and precise treatment of animals and to reduce inputs, of e.g. antibiotics, and costs. Livestock tracking may also e.g. support climate mitigation by assessing livestock density against land carrying capacity and reduce soil disturbance and compaction. It may also facilitate the provision of information to consumers on the products offered and enhance transparency along the supply chain and offer a means to against legal commitments of livestock densities, e.g. in the context of CAP strategic plans.
Frequently (public) registers are not interlinked and approaches towards data collection on livestock across Member States vary. Private sector efforts in livestock tracking are frequently not systemised and not scaled up. The potential for synergies between public and private sector initiatives in livestock tracking appears not to be fully explored and exploited.
Proposals should address the following:
?	Elaborate on the potential for the generation of data sets through the development and applications of digital solutions to track livestock.
?	Elaborate the opportunities of linking tracking efforts to sensor information providing information on animal health (and welfare) using the potential of innovative technologies;
?	Develop concepts for data-based solutions for the private and public sector to track livestock and its conditions (including geospatial information) under consideration of multiple possible application cases, such as administrative purposes and legal commitments, labelling, predator and pest prevention; this activity should include an assessment of possible socio-economic and environmental effects, including the potential for reducing administrative costs and for policy monitoring, which could be achieved through the use of the data sets.
?	Highlight the potential of and elaborate concepts for upscaling of data-based digital solutions for livestock tracking to EU (and international) level.
?	Bring together key stakeholders from the public and private domain to explore ? among others - opportunities to implement identified data-based and digital solutions, as well as to share data.
Proposals should consider existing and forthcoming data bases/ registers related to livestock as well as (forthcoming) sector-specific and horizontal legal requirements in the EU, including in the field of digital and data technologies. Proposals are expected to take stock of livestock tracking initiatives in the private domain, including in third countries and to draw lessons learnt, as well as of digital tracking technologies used in other sectors/ domains. Proposals are encouraged to explore interlinks with other innovative technologies, such as genomics, and application cases, such as recording breeding traits. Proposals are encouraged to reflect on the aspect of affordability of digital technologies as well as on the potential effects of livestock tracking for producers, food processors, and consumers. Proposals are encouraged to involve representatives of the public administration from all EU Member States and of relevant EU institutions,  as well as to link up to/ exchange with relevant EU funded projects, including projects funded under Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe Programme.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-15," Digitalisation in agriculture and forestry:  markets for data, and digital technologies and infrastructure ? state of play and foresight in a fast changing regulatory, trade and technical environment",3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy in particular, and the headline ambition of a Digital Age, a successful proposal will support the capacities to understand and forecast the development of markets and the use of data and digital technologies in agriculture and forestry, particularly through the development of innovative assessment and modelling approaches. It will therefore support decreasing the risk of investing into digital infrastructure, and indirectly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance and competitiveness in agriculture through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers, and to the development of innovative governance models.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Analyses of global markets through innovative approaches including trends, potential barriers and risks associated with investments in data, digital and data technologies in the agriculture and forestry sectors.
?	Increased transparency in data sharing and in the markets for digital and data technologies in the agricultural and forestry sectors in support of healthy competition.
?	Contribution to an increased uptake of digital and data technologies in agriculture and forestry including through reduced investment risks; this is expected to indirectly contribute to an increase in environmental and economic performance of the sectors through increased and enhanced used of data, and digital and data technologies.
?	Strengthened policy-making and -monitoring and foresight capacities.
Scope: The potential of digital and data technologies in the agricultural and forestry sectors to enhance their sustainability and economic performance and working conditions has been acknowledged. The uptake of digital technologies in the sectors and the development of supplementing data- and data-technology-based solutions in the EU are increasing. However, there is hardly comprehensive, independently collected data about the actual uptake and use of digital technologies by farmers and foresters, about the trade of sector-related data and digital technologies, and about the extent and structure of the provision of digital and data services in the agricultural and forestry supply chains, which are of global outreach.
At the same time, policies and the regulatory framework directly or indirectly influencing the deployment of digital and data technologies in the EU are evolving in a fast pace and will continue to do so.  Also trade regimes are continuously changing. For stakeholder in the agricultural, forestry and the digital sectors to invest in digital and data technologies, it is important to be able to assess the possible implications of changing regulatory and market conditions on the development, purchase and use of data, and digital and data technologies. This is also supported by an increase in information on markets and related actor networks, and information on the storage and the flows of goods and data, through increased transparency and a strengthened position of users and consumers. Such information as well as capacities in modelling and in carrying out foresight analyses for the development of markets and of the situation in the agricultural sector is also one pre-requisite for tailored policy-making.
Fostering the provision of insights into markets of data, and digital and data technologies in the agricultural and forestry sectors, the proposals should address the following:
?	Development of innovative approaches to assess the uptake of digital technologies and digital infrastructure (incl. platforms) in the agricultural, and forestry sectors globally with special attention to the situation in the EU and Associated Countries.
?	Development of innovative approaches to forecast the markets of data, digital technologies and digital infrastructure (including platforms) and the uptake of digital technologies globally with special attention to the situation in the EU under consideration of fast-changing regulatory framing conditions in the fields of data-, digital and machinery technologies and of agricultural and forestry policies.
?	Demonstration of the qualitative and quantitative implications of market and technology trends in the fields of data, digital technologies and digital infrastructure for the use of digital and data technologies by farmers, foresters and other actors along the supply chains in a way that demonstration results can be steadily adapted to changing framing conditions. Demonstrations should allow for the reflection of scenarios and provide input to policy-making.
Project(s) are expected to consider innovation in digital technologies brought onto the market during the life-time of the project. It is expected that the project(s) are working with targeted stakeholders, including farmers, foresters, agri-businesses, farm advisors, policy-makers etc. to test demonstration and communication tools.
For the assessment of the uptake of digital technologies by farmers and foresters, statistical approaches evolving in the EU are to be considered, if applicable; assessment approaches may vary between continents.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-16," Digital technologies supporting plant health early detection, territory surveillance and phytosanitary measures",3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-2,"Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the biodiversity and farm to fork strategies, a successful proposal will contribute to transition to fair, healthy and resilient agriculture and forestry, notably the target to reduce by 50% the overall use and risk of chemical pesticides. Proposals will support Regulation (EU) 2016/2031  on protective measures against plant pests.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes
?	Increase the availability of large-scale and robust plant scanning methods to monitor plant pests, to assist territorial surveillance and help with timely eradication or optimisation of containment measures;
?	Enhance innovative and cost-efficient integration of methods, including remote sensing and networks of traps that are available for surveillance of EU regulated plant pests affecting agriculture, forestry, other activities and areas (e.g., urban areas);
?	Strengthen capacities to prevent entry and spread and to monitor EU regulated plant pests and support plant health territorial surveillance;
?	Foster transdisciplinary cooperation in the fields of plant health, environmental sciences and earth observation.
?	Support relevant EU and Associated Countries? plant health policies.
Scope: Pest monitoring is typically performed through costly and time-consuming on-site visits, resulting in certain cases in limited spatial and temporal resolution. Consequently, there is a need for more cost-effective approaches to detect and discriminate infested plants, including trees, at large spatial scales and within reasonable time frames. The advent of new technology in remote sensing, sensor technologies, robotics, remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS), the internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), opens opportunities for monitoring continuously, more widely, and remotely. These technologies have the potential to guide and help to target on site surveillance and early detection activities and other phytosanitary measures.
Proposals should:
?	Develop and test early detection strategies by exploiting digital technologies, e.g., networks of sensors and remote sensing, to improve the surveillance efforts and the delimitation of affected areas by regulated pests allowing a regular and rapid monitoring of large areas that might be difficult to reach;
?	Enhance and optimize the use of insect traps in a network setting for an IoT approach;
?	Develop user-friendly and accessible tools or methods, including through the use of robotics to monitor a suite of known stress-processes in plants (chlorosis, changes in fluorescence, loss of transportation, etc.) that can be used in plant pest detection and/or to monitor occurrence of pests;
?	Contribute to disentangle biotic and abiotic stresses, enabling the early detection of pests, by pushing further the current (and the new generation of satellite missions, e.g., FLEX ) capabilities of remote sensing (measurements taken by hand-held, towers, drones, and satellite data), AI, and other digital strategies;
?	Collect standardised and comprehensive data (e.g., field observations, laboratory measurements, remotely sensed data, etc.) that contribute to monitor plant health and pests and to develop an early warning surveillance system;
?	Assess the cost-benefits of the proposed methods;
?	Integrate citizen science as a tool to monitor pests, developing robust methods to use its data for systematic analysis, and increasing public and stakeholder engagement.
Proposals should identify common standards and common indicators to collect data, as well as interoperability and metadata standards. Proposals should develop recommendations on how to make the best use and scale up digital technologies for plant pests early detection and territorial surveillance applications.
Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various sectors such as research, plant health services, farming/forestry sectors, other relevant authorities, and industry are brought together.
Proposals should build on the results of relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020. Proposals should specify how they plan to collaborate with other proposals selected under this and, if feasible, with other relevant topics , e.g., by undertaking joint activities, workshops or common communication and dissemination activities. Proposals should allocate the necessary resources to cover these activities.
If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS. Other data and services may be used in addition. All in-situ data collected through actions funded from this call should follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission (Copernicus, GEOSS).
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA FutureEO programme for agriculture  and the EC on Earth System Science. Applicants are encouraged to coordinate with the relevant ESA projects and in particular those of the ESA Agriculture Science Cluster Activities (agriculturesciencecluster.esa.int) in their proposals.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-17, Data-driven solutions to foster industry?s contribution to inclusive and sustainable food systems,3/23/2023,RIA,12/22/2022,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: This topic will enhance the sustainability performance and competitiveness in the domains covered by Cluster 6 through further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers. It will help to achieve better informed decision-making processes, social engagement, governance, and innovation. It will help deliver solutions to advance the European Green Deal priorities, the EU's climate targets for 2030 and 2050 and the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system. It will contribute to the food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities and improving the data economy for food systems and enhance transparency.
There is already commitment in the private sector to drive change towards more sustainable food systems. One example is the ?EU Code of Conduct on Responsible Food Business and Marketing Practices ?, an integral part of the farm to fork strategy. Many businesses have already signed the voluntary agreement . This commitment also includes an R&I dimension that can be expanded to the respective topic.
Data-driven solutions in food systems also may support the European open data directive to share public data  and foreseen data spaces  as well as provide a base of Artificial Intelligence (AI) deployment as enablers of the European Green Deal objectives.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased insights into the potential benefits and feasibility of data and technology employed by the private sector together with public stakeholders to drive sustainable food system transformation while respecting the relevant legal and policy frameworks;
?	Enhanced transition towards sustainable healthy diets for all by using data driven solutions in the food sector.
Scope: Data are key to drive citizens? sustainability practices. Several actors in the private food sector have access to valuable sustainability-related data, for example grocery retail, food processing and delivery services with huge potential to be used to foster the transition to sustainable food systems. At the same time, there is potential in mapping possible beneficial data not yet tested and a vision of a new spectrum of data overcoming availability bias. Data can be used to foster citizens? sustainability practices, for example as a contributor to positively influence and monitor dietary changes. Industry contribution to the transition to sustainable food systems by engaging citizens in such transition can be very impactful while keeping the integrity of private intellectual property of the businesses. By democratizing data, private actors might gain a competitive advantage and activate other players to fulfil the need of transparency and proof of sustainability efforts for citizens.
Proposals are expected to address the following:
?	Analyse current systems of private data sharing in the food system (monetary incentives, actors involved?etc.);
?	Initiate first tests of potential data sharing, also with SMEs and potentially start-ups, to identify potential impacts and benefits and serve as a lighthouse;
?	Explore ?new? types of data and identify relevant data within the food system by also ?unconventional players? to tap into unused data sources, point out the main value pool for data sharing, outline potential needs of data gathering/harmonisation and map out an enhanced data framework and data collection strategy including needed technology (AI, Robotics, IoT) to drive sustainable food system transformation;
?	Make use of analytics, forecast and AI to identify influential factors for making sustainable choices;
?	Analyse the impacts on the sustainability of food systems of the proposed solutions considering the entire food supply chain and the different dimensions of sustainability;
?	Define ways to use data to inform and guide consumer choices at the point of purchase in line with EU food law and policies;
?	Set-up a potential framework for sharing non-competitive data that defines principles and collect good practices to foster sustainable food system objectives that ensures the protection of private data and sensitive business data and explore how this data can be integrated in the ?Smart communities data space?5;
?	Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of relevant stakeholders also in the health domain, such as doctors and nurses, and SMEs and start-ups;
?	Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and under the topic 2022-GOVERNANCE-10 ?Piloting approaches and tools to empower citizens to exercise their ?data rights? in food and nutrition? and HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-01-8 ?Preventing and reducing food waste to reduce environmental impacts and to help reach 2030 climate targets?;
?	Include social innovation as the solution is at the socio-technical interface and requires social change, new social practices and social ownership;
?	This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines",

They will address the necessity of primary producers for impartial and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience. They will also speed up innovation and the uptake of results, and will be key to improving sustainability.
They will contribute to effective Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS ), thereby adding value to the knowledge and cost-effectiveness of innovative practices and techniques in and across primary production sectors, food and bioeconomy systems, and lead to more informed and engaged stakeholders and users of project results.
Despite the continued funding of scientific projects, new knowledge, innovative ideas and methods from practice are not sufficiently captured and spread. The research findings are often not integrated into agricultural and forestry practice. The proposals, acting at EU level to remedy this, are essential because national and sectoral agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKISs) are insufficiently connected and organised to fully meet the challenge of intensifying thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. This exchange of knowledge will foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture and forestry and build trust between the main AKIS actors. It will scale local solutions up to the EU level and may even influence policy design wherever useful.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Contribution to the cross-cutting objective of the CAP on modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake  , as well as to the European Green Deal and farm to fork Strategy objectives and targets.
?	Collection and distribution of easily accessible practice-oriented knowledge on the thematic area chosen, in particular the existing innovative solutions, best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners.
?	Maintenance of practical knowledge in the long-term ? beyond the project period ? in particular by using the main trusted dissemination channels which farmers/foresters most often consult.
?	Increased flow of practical information between farmers/foresters in the EU in a geographically balanced way, creating spill-overs and taking account of the differences between territories.
?	Greater user acceptance of collected solutions and a more intensive dissemination of existing knowledge, by connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up innovation and promote the faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice.

HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-20, Developing an EU advisory network on organic agriculture,3/23/2023,CSA,12/22/2022,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will support the objectives of the European Green Deal, and notably its farm to fork and biodiversity strategies, and the sustainable carbon cycle communication, to transition to fair, healthy, climate and environmentally-friendly food systems from primary production to consumption, in particular the objective to promote organic farming in Europe. Activities will support the implementation of the action plan on the development of organic production  and of the common agricultural policy (CAP).
The successful proposal will focus on exchanges between farm advisors across the EU in order to increase the speed of knowledge creation and sharing, capacity building, demonstration of innovative solutions in organic farming, as well as helping to bring them into practice in order to accelerate adoption of these solutions.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Accelerated progress towards achieving the policy objectives linked to the farm to fork strategy?s target on organic farming, and in particular those identified under the Action Plan on the Development of Organic Production, as well as the new CAP;
?	Supported implementation in Member States of the CAP?s cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake ;
?	Enhanced interactions among advisors and other relevant actors in the EU and Associated Countries conducive to a strengthened research and innovation ecosystem for organic farming;
?	Increased provision of supporting services and materials that facilitate the conversion to and upscaling of organic farming;
?	Accelerated introduction, spread and implementation in practice of innovative solutions related to organic farming leading to improved production methods of organic farms.
Scope: Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) , in which advisors play a central role, are key drivers to speed up innovation and the uptake of research results by farmers. Transformative changes such as the ones called for by the farm to fork strategy, are dynamic and knowledge-intensive processes that require appropriate governance of AKIS actors. Advisors play a key role in steering and influencing farmers? decisions. A novelty in the post-2020 CAP plans  is that advisors must be integrated within the Member States? AKIS, and that the scope of their actions has become much broader. Advisors must be able to cover the economic, environmental and social domains, as well as being up-to-date on scientific and innovation developments. They should be able to translate this knowledge into concrete opportunities for the end users, and adapt those to specific local circumstances.
This topic focuses on the important role that advisors can play in relation to boosting organic farming towards reaching the target of at least 25% of the EU's agricultural land under organic farming by 2030. In particular, advisors can play a key role in encouraging conversion to organic farming and in facilitating this process to farmers, and overall in tackling the challenges of organic farming. In this context, advisors are in a good position to provide hands-on training to organic farmers, to inspire new and incoming farmers or farms at the cross-roads of intergenerational renewal, to connect with education and ensure broad communication, to support peer-to-peer consulting, and to develop on-farm demonstrations.
Proposals should set up an EU advisory network dedicated to organic farming, covering both organic plant production systems and organic animal husbandry. The network should involve participants from at least 20 EU Member States, including countries in which the organic sector is more developed and less developed. In this context, proposals should:
?	Connect farm advisors across the EU , with a view to sharing experiences on how to best tackle the main issues of the sector.
?	Undertake knowledge, best practice and innovation exchange activities that support Member States in making the best use of the possibilities offered by the new CAP to support their national organic sector.
?	Fill gaps on emerging advisory topics beyond the classical sectorial advice, in particular in view of the new obligation for Member States to integrate advisors within their AKIS.
?	Serve as a platform to bring stakeholders together to discuss challenges and solutions to practical organic farming problems, such as bottlenecks, lock-ins, power imbalances, normative aspects, lack of consumer buy-in or trust, inequalities between Member States, etc.;
?	Provide overall support related to knowledge creation, organisation and sharing. This could include peer-to-peer counselling, master classes, (digital) advice modules, communication and education materials, etc.
?	Promote the sharing of effective and novel approaches that are sustainable in terms of economic, environmental and social aspects.
?	Create added value by ensuring stronger links between research, education, advisors and farming practice and encouraging the wider use of available knowledge across the EU.
?	Spread ready-to-use innovative solutions to practitioners and ensuring communication to the scientific community of research needs from practice.
?	Taking strong account of cost-benefit elements, collect and document good examples of connecting farmers, intermediates and consumers in Member States to be able to take into account financial aspects and local conditions. Select the best practices, and extract lessons about the key success factors, possible quick wins and make them available for (local) exploitation.
?	Promote the integration of the advisors of the EU advisory network on organic farming into their Member State?s AKIS.
?	Explore if the activities of the EU advisory network on organic farming can be up scaled at the level of a number of Member States under a cooperative format. Seek if common tools can be created to incentivise the implementation of the learnings from this project.
?	Organise training activities for new advisors to be integrated in the network during the course of the project.
?	In the EU advisory network, use local AKIS connections which can more accurately interpret the national/regional contexts to help develop the best solutions for that Member State or region. Use the support of the Member States? knowledge and innovation experts of the SCAR-AKIS Strategic Working Group and of the SCAR Agroecology Strategic Working Group  to discuss project strategy and progress in the various stages of the project.
Outcomes should be spread beyond the organic farming communities and reach also farmers involved in conventional, carbon, low-input, circular agriculture or agroecology. Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach, with a majority of partners being organic farming advisors with solid field experience. Proposals should capitalise and build on the outputs of relevant EIP-AGRI Operational Groups and EIP-AGRI networking activities, as well as those of the Horizon 2020 Thematic Networks related to organic farming. Proposals should dedicate a task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will ensure synergy with and take into consideration the results of other initiatives under Horizon Europe, including the projects selected under the topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-01: ?Reaching the farm to fork target: R&I scenarios for boosting organic farming and organic aquaculture in Europe?, and HORIZON-CL6-2021-BIODIV-01-14: ?Fostering organic crop breeding? in the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2021-2022. Proposals should also dedicate appropriate resources to ensure synergies with the activities carried out by projects selected under the following topics in this work programme: HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-1-two-stage: ?Increasing the availability and use of non-contentious inputs in organic farming?, and HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK: ?Improving yields in organic cropping systems?, HORIZON-CL6-2023-CLIMATE-01-5: ?Pilot network of climate-positive organic farms?, as well as coherence and synergies with the activities of the future partnership ?Accelerating farming systems transition: agroecology living labs and research infrastructures?. Proposals should provide all outcomes and materials to the European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI), including in the common 'practice abstract' format for EU wide dissemination, as well as to national/regional/local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24) in the requested formats",

The second instalment of the partnership is expected to contribute to all expected outcomes specified in topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate-neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, for continuation and new development of activities.
Scope: The objective of this action is to continue to provide support to the European Partnership for a climate-neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy (SBEP) identified in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and first implemented under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy, and in particular to fund additional activities (which may also be undertaken by additional partners) in view of its intended scope and duration, and in accordance with Article 24(2) of the Horizon Europe Regulation.
The consortium which applied to and received funding under HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 is uniquely placed to submit a proposal to continue the envisioned partnership. Not only did this consortium submit the proposal leading to the identification of the partnership in the Horizon Europe strategic planning 2021-2024, it has also implemented the partnership through co-funded calls in year 2022 based on this planning and further to topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02. In this context, the current consortium has particular expertise in relation to the objectives of the Partnership, the activities to be implemented, in particular FSTP calls or other calls/scope of calls clearly required/envisioned pursuant to initial proposal/partnership, and other relevant aspects of the action. In practice, another consortium could not continue the activities of the Partnership underway without significant disruption to the ongoing activities, if at all.
The scope of the application for this call on the European partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy should focus on duly justified continuation or additional priority areas, additional activities and additional partners, including from additional countries, delivering knowledge and solutions to make the blue economy sustainable and ensure that its benefits are distributed fairly, by aligning national, regional and EU R&I priorities and bringing together science, industry, governance and society.
Responding to national and EU policy goals (e.g., European Green Deal, Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directive, Natura and Maritime Spatial Planning Directives), the partnership's continued and/or additional priority areas should aim to achieve a healthy ocean, a sustainable and productive blue economy and the well-being of citizens, for which the long-term vision for the EU?s rural areas and its objectives (in particular contributing to stronger and resilient rural (coastal) areas) should also be considered, with its flagship initiative ?Research and innovation for rural (coastal) communities?.
The partnership is expected to continue to organise joint calls as part of the additional activities and therefore it should factor ample time to run the co-funded projects. The partnership should further promote technological, nature-based, social, economic and cultural innovation and experiment with new planning, governance, business and finance models.
The partnership's additional activities are expected to be designed and described in such a way that it is clear how they will increase scientific contributions, applicable in a legal/regulatory context, and how they will facilitate the use of scientific knowledge by regulators and policymakers, contributing to the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the farm to fork strategy, the mission ?Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030?, the circular economy action plan, the zero pollution ambition and the transformation of Europe?s blue economy towards climate-neutral status by 2050, as also reflected in the communication on a new approach for a sustainable blue economy in the EU ?Transforming the EU's Blue Economy for a Sustainable Future?.
The partnership is also expected to have a structuring function with regard to European integrated ocean observing systems and data analyses. The partnership is expected to put specific emphasis on how to contribute to the future EU initiative on ocean observation, to have a key role in the implementation of the European Ocean Observing System (EOOS), including research infrastructures, in the development of a common European ocean data space connected to the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and European Green Deal data spaces, and contribute to the development of Digital Twin Ocean. All quality-controlled data collected through actions funded from this co-fund call should follow FAIR principles and be made available through open access data systems supported by the European Commission (such as Copernicus, GEOSS, EMODnet).
The partnership's additional activities should put the emphasis on the development of basin- or Europe-wide holistic, integrated, systemic and cross-sectoral approaches and foster co-creation processes involving all relevant stakeholders and actors, while remaining operationally manageable and taking into account the reccomendations from additional support offered by the European Commission in 2022. The additional activities are expected to be implemented through the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of researchers from different disciplines, advisors, local, regional and national authorities, government representatives, industry and businesses, including SMEs, knowledge institutions and citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and other relevant actors of the value chain, supported through Open Science and an inclusive governance, policy and decision-making. It should harness the full potential of social sciences and humanities (SSH), social innovation and citizen engagement to deliver portfolios of solutions, measures and tools and facilitate their replication, and upscaling. In particular, the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and expertise is expected to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research and innovation activities.
Additional activities should contribute to improve the health and quality of life and long-term socio-economic prospects of coastal communities, including women, youth and the most vulnerable groups like indigenous people, in the context of major transitions and rising threats to climate, resources and health, including by increasing their resilience to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with the European Commission?s political vision of leaving no one behind, the wide diversity and heterogeneity in levels of socio-economic, technological, institutional, innovation and skills potential should be taken into account.
The partnership is expected to include partners from additional countries, including Associated Countries, in its consortium, as it should cover the Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Mediterranean and the Black Sea to the maximum extent possible. It is expected to include and be open to all relevant public marine/maritime funding organisations and ministries from EU Member States and Associated Countries as core members, in close cooperation with the private sector, including SMEs and foundations. Appropriate links to other relevant ministries and organisations, including civil society, should be established.
Given the global dimension of ocean policy, membership and other modalities of participation from organisations and institutions in Non-Associated Third Countries is expected, in particular key partners bordering the different EU sea basins. In line with the Europe?s global approach to cooperation in research and innovation, international cooperation should contribute to align strategies and research agendas, strengthen data collection, monitoring and sharing, as well as access to research infrastructures, promote good practice for maritime policies, promote the exchange and export of key technologies and gradually open up cooperation with new countries outside of Europe.
Through the additional activities and new partners, the partnership should support the EU?s strong commitment to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, the UN Decade of Ecosystem Restoration, the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative, the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance, the BLUEMED Initiative, the Black Sea Synergy and other international initiatives.
Partners are expected to continue to provide contributions for the governance structure, the joint calls and other dedicated implementation actions and efforts for national coordination. The partnership is expected to mobilise EU, national and regional capacities to leverage investments, including from the private sector, increase up-scalability and market accessibility for the developed solutions and thus increase the return to investments.
To ensure the coherence and complementarity of activities, and to leverage knowledge investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to foster close cooperation and ensure synergies with other relevant European Partnerships, in place and proposed, notably ?Rescuing biodiversity to safeguard life on Earth?, ?Sustainable food systems for people, planet and climate?, ?Water security for the planet (Water4All)?, and related actions for coordinating and supporting the combined activities of Member States and Associated Countries towards the objectives of the ?Zero-emission waterborne transport? (ZEWT) Partnership, ?Clean Energy Transition?, ?Artificial intelligence, Data and Robotics?, the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and others where relevant, as well as the EIT Climate KIC, the EIT FOOD and the ?European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)?. The partnership will also be linked to the relevant objectives of the mission ?Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030?. Proposers are expected to describe in details the way to plan and implement such collaborations through dedicated tasks and appropriate resources.
Engaging with managing authorities of European Structural and Investment Funds, as well as others like LIFE, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III) and Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), during partnership implementation would help increase the implementation of the project outcomes and support and facilitate further uptake.
While the award of a grant to continue the Partnership in accordance with this call should be based on a proposal submitted by the coordinator of the consortium funded under HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02: European Partnership for a climate neutral, sustainable and productive Blue Economy and the additional activities (which may include additional partners) to be funded by the grant should be subject to an evaluation, this evaluation should take into account the existing context and the scope of the initial evaluation as relevant, and related obligations enshrined in the grant agreement.
Taking into account that the present action is a continuation of topic HORIZON-CL6-2022-GOVERNANCE-01-02 and foresees an amendment to an existing grant agreement, the proposal should also present in a separate document the additional activities and additional partners, if any, to be covered by the award in terms of how they would be reflected in the grant agreement. The proposal should also describe the specific activities foreseen in order to strengthen the synergies with other related Missions and Partnerships.
The Commission envisages to include new actions in future work programme(s) to continue providing support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-2, Regional ecosystems of innovation to foster food system transformation,2/28/2024,CSA,10/17/2023,,,Around 3.50-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food system, the food 2030 priorities and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will contribute to the sustainability and resilience of EU food systems by supporting the establishment of innovative governance models notably to achieve better-informed decision-making processes, social engagement and innovation. Successful proposals will boost knowledge sharing, interactions and priority setting in the form of an acceleration agenda between all relevant food systems actors, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industrial clusters, start-ups, universities/research centres, public authorities and civil society organisations.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Coherent business-focused analysis of R&I bottlenecks and opportunities for the transition of European food systems in line with the farm to fork strategy objectives, in particular to contribute to the 25% organic food target.
?	Improved coordination of existing European and national platforms with regional innovation ecosystems actors at EU level.
?	Strengthened European regions (NUTS 2 level) and their regional actors.
?	Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Scope: Collaboration between innovation actors across Europe is necessary to accelerate and master the innovative solutions needed for the food system transformation and the implementation of sustainable solutions. Innovation ecosystems can be found in many locations in Europe, but too few places can be seen as regional ecosystems of innovation. Moreover, the strength and depth of interconnections, information flows and knowledge transfers inside innovation ecosystems and between actors vary widely.
Strong and well-connected food systems actors, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industrial clusters, start-ups, universities/research centres, public authorities and civil society organisations, have the potential to become ecosystems of innovation facilitating coordination and multi-stakeholder engagement, to create an effective framework for action to support the food system transition in the EU and Associated Countries. The framework is expected to allow pooling of resources, coordinating efforts, and facilitating and promoting the multi-actor approach. Relevant capacities to foster the necessary R&I in the short, medium, and long term will be developed, giving a specific focus to the objective to boost the organic food sector.
Proposed activities should cover all of the following aspects:
?	Strengthen existing ecosystems of innovation to broaden their scope and take on a ?food systems approach? that delivers on the Food 2030 co-benefits (nutrition, public health, climate, circularity and communities) by: (a) deploying a quadruple helix model (that fully engages the four major actors in the innovation system: small and medium-sized enterprises and industrial clusters, universities/research centres, public authorities, and civil society organisations); and (b) delivering solutions that empower regional actors and their regional innovation ecosystems through an acceleration agenda.
?	Devise an acceleration agenda connected with existing research and innovation agendas that align to target mutual objectives and cross regional collaborations, in particular by identifying and creating links to regions with priorities relevant for sustainable food systems identified in their local smart specialisation strategies, as well as relevant smart specialisation partnerships and platforms (such as the Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform on Agri-food).
?	Provide technical assistance, encourage ?mutual learning? and stimulate ?new? ecosystems of innovation in parts of Europe that are less well integrated, for example with the objectives of the BIOEAST Food Systems Thematic Working Group (e.g., to catalyse future reflections and discussions at regional level regarding the need to work together to tackle food system transformations).
?	Explore how the existing Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) approach can help regional actors to implement farm to fork relevant objectives, in particular for societally relevant market solutions that contribute to public health objectives and environmental businesses such that they contribute to the ?EU Code of Conduct on Responsible Food Business and Marketing Practice?.
?	Take a systemic view to help industries built up around the European food systems related businesses, to innovate and cooperate, thereby proposing solutions of regional relevance.
?	Identify and facilitate synergies with other financing and capacity building instruments to enable progress along the whole innovation pipeline, including the Interregional Innovation Investments (I3), a new funding instrument under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and industrial clusters, start-ups, universities/research centres, public authorities and civil society organisations and other relevant actors of the value chain.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under in the work programme from 2018-2020 and 2021-2022, namely CE-FNR-07-2020: ?FOOD 2030 - Empowering cities as agents of food system transformation? and HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-07 ?Regional governance models in the bioeconomy?.
Collaboration and complementary with the European Partnership on ?Sustainable Food Systems for People, Plant and Climate? is encouraged. This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines, as it involves the quadruple helix to deliver innovative locally-based and bottom-up solutions, engaging citizens and leading to behavioural changes. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-3," The role of mainstream media, social media and marketing in fostering healthy and sustainable consumption patterns and how to encourage good practices",2/28/2024,CSA,10/17/2023,,,Around 3.00-1,"Expected Outcome: In line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, Europe?s beating cancer plan, the farm to fork strategy for a fair, healthy and environment?friendly food system, the food 2030 priorities and the EU?s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050, the successful proposal will facilitate the transition towards healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour by supporting the establishment of innovative governance models notably to achieve better-informed decision-making processes, social engagement and innovation. The main objective of this topic is to better understand factors influencing dietary behaviour and to advance the understanding of the role of mainstream media, social media and digital marketing in fostering (un-)healthy and (un-)sustainable consumption patterns and to encourage good practices.
Projects results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Improved knowledge and understanding of how mainstream media, social media and marketing is affecting the dietary behaviour of different target groups (in particular vulnerable groups) across Europe, including barriers and constraints, as well as how to detect incorrect or misleading information.
?	Better understanding of the different media and marketing (both linear and non-linear) approaches and channels used by different food system operators and actors.
?	Enabling consumers to make informed food choices.
?	Informed policies and business strategies aimed at fostering healthy and sustainable food environments, consumption patterns and at encouraging or incentivizing good practices.
?	Contribution to the farm to fork objectives and food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate, biodiversity and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Scope: Food consumption cannot be considered the sole responsibility of citizens or a problem of demand only since it is a result of a choice that is influenced by culture, social and economic factors and where the food environment plays an important role. In todays? interconnected world, the impacts of mainstream media, social media and digital marketing are amplified, with food influencers, NGOs and social platforms making citizens think differently about food. As studies show, since eating habits are also influenced by what consumers see, being virtually surrounded by healthy eaters may encourage consumers to eat healthier. However, the reverse is also true.
In addition, differences in media and marketing (both linear and non-linear) approaches of national/regional/local governments, civil society, and the private sector, can lead to differences in consumption patterns and food choices across different socio-economic and cultural groups. Moreover, television viewing and internet use has led to a more inactive, sedentary lifestyle, as well as more exposure to the marketing of products high in fat, sugar and/or salt among adults and children. Greater levels of TV viewing and internet use is associated with harmful effects on the eating habits of children. This includes higher consumption levels of products high in fat, sugar and/or salt. An improved understanding of these differences and drivers of food choices can support all food systems operators and actors to develop innovative and effective communication strategies (and related policy and regulatory frameworks) that would benefit all parts of the society and support a shift towards healthy and sustainable diets for all.
Proposed activities should cover all of the following aspects:
?	Identify the various techniques and vehicles for spreading information and influence behaviour using different mainstream and social media channels (such as apps, websites, virtual consumer clubs and platforms), in particular mapping of new communication tools, algorithms and machines learning principles where citizens make food choices or are consciously or unconsciously influenced to change the consumption behaviour.
?	Compare the different media and marketing (both linear and non-linear) approaches of national/regional/local governments, civil society, and the private sector, and assess how these different types of approaches and channels affect consumption patterns and food choices across different socio-economic and cultural groups, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable groups such as persons with low socio/economic status, infants and children or their parents responsible for their diets, respectively.
?	Explore the impact of negative news (e.g., information on food safety risks, information on impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems) as compared with messages promoting positive outcomes of food choices (e.g., information on nutritional and health benefits) by, for example, conducting surveys or employing sentiment analyses. Assess whether parental control can be considered an effective strategy given the real-world context and levels of independent exposure of children to linear and non-linear media. Also explore the effects of misinformation (intentional or not), and how this propagates through different media.
?	Identify innovative and effective tools to improve communication on sustainable healthy nutrition and diets, and more generally on sustainable food systems, thereby ensuring that all parts of the society are benefitting from access to information that foster uptake of healthy and sustainable diets and lead to the transformation of food systems, while respecting the EU and national legal framework and policies, national educational policies and advice on nutrition and food.
?	Compile strategies and best practices ? in compliance with the Best Practice Portal Protocols ? for all food systems operators and actors for communication and outreach efforts to foster healthy, sustainable, and alternative consumption patterns and to encourage good practices, while respecting the EU and national legal framework and policies, national educational policies and advice on nutrition and food.
?	Clearly explain how results will deliver co-benefits on Europe?s Beating Cancer Plan, the farm to fork strategy and on each of the food 2030 priorities: nutrition for sustainable healthy diets, climate and environment, circularity and resource efficiency, innovation and empowering communities (e.g., meeting the needs, values and expectations of society in a responsible and ethical way).
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach' and ensure adequate involvement of public authorities and civil society organisations, consumers, the private sector and other relevant actors of the value chain.
Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the recent studies carried out in this area (such as the study on the exposure of children to online marketing of foods high in fat, salt or sugar),  on the results of past and ongoing EU joint actions (such as Best-ReMaP on diet and nutrition with a special focus on children) and EU research projects (such as the topics HORIZON-CL6-2021-FARM2FORK-01-15 and HORIZON-CL6-2023-COMMUNITIES), e.g. by participating in joint activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities.
Proposals should bring together multiple types of scientific expertise in health and natural sciences, and social sciences and humanities (SSH). This topic should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines (e.g., economics, sociology, human geography, management science, political science, citizen engagement studies, cultural studies, gender studies, etc.).
Efforts should be made to ensure that the data and the output produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-4, Supporting the All-Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance and Declaration,2/28/2024,CSA,10/17/2023,,,Around 4.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Facilitated synergies in youth and gender programmes and capacity development for early career professionals; educational and inter-generational activities in favour of youth and communities living on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.
Scope: The actions should aim at supporting a wider understanding of the opportunities and promoting a sustainable management of the Atlantic Ocean as a whole, through a large-scale basin effort involving both the northern and the southern parts of this ocean, and its interlinks with the adjacent polar areas. To achieve this, it will be necessary to bring together and systematically connect scientists, a wide range of public and private stakeholders, including civil society and youth, with data, knowledge, expertise, capacities, infrastructures and resources.
Building on the pre-existing cooperative efforts under the Galway and Bel‚m Statements and the existing and future bilateral administrative arrangements between the EU and Atlantic partner countries, this cooperation can continue to converge towards the implementation of a systemic approach by linking and jointly tackling the climate-food-ocean challenges, including extreme events and sea level rise. Overall, activities should contribute to upscaling cooperation along and across the Atlantic Ocean, including the specific on-going and future activities and initiatives related to the Arctic and Antarctica. They should include upscaling of long-term partnerships building also on on-going initiatives such as the All-Atlantic Ocean Youth Ambassadors, joint actions, working groups, pledging platform, etc, for the benefit of the All-Atlantic local communities. This action is expected to bring research and innovation results for their benefit and to also empower for and link early career professional to all these activities.

HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-5, Customisation/pre-operationalisation of prototypes end-user services in the area Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation,2/28/2024,PCP,10/17/2023,,,Around 19.00-1,"Expected Outcome: The successful proposal will be contributing to the European Green Deal related domains benefiting from further deployment, uptake and exploitation of Environmental Observation data and products. It will furthermore be contributing to fit-for-purpose Environmental Observation Systems and a strengthened Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) .
Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Customisation/pre-operationalisation of prototypes end-user services in the area Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, building on the Copernicus  Services that respond to the common needs and beyond state-of-the-art performance targets of the buyers group;
?	Reduction of fragmentation of demand for innovative solutions by enabling public procurers to collectively implement a Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) in the area of climate adaptation and mitigation, which, due to their nature, are better addressed jointly, or which they would not have been able to tackle independently;
?	New opportunities for wide market uptake and economies of scale for the supply side through the use of joint specifications, wide publication of results and ? where relevant ? contribution to standardization, regulation or certification to remove barriers for introduction of innovations into the market and creation of new products, processes and/or services ready for market uptake, leading to viable new businesses, jobs and sustainable economic growth.
Scope: This PCP ? i.e. a joint procurement of research and development services - is launched to reinforce public demand driven innovation in end-user services in the area of climate adaptation and mitigation. PCP has the potential to be an effective demand side innovation action and a useful tool to close the gap between supply and demand for innovative solutions.
The PCP should deliver successful innovative and fully tested product(s) and/or service(s) that meet the common needs of a buyers' group (consortium of procurers) to procure research, develop innovative marketable solutions, speed up the time-to-market and provide best value for money.
Activities shall include:
?	Preparation of the relevant documentation needed to launch and implement the procurement procedure;
?	Joint research activities relating to the customisation/pre-operationalisation of prototypes end-user services in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation validating the PCP strategy;
?	Activities for the follow-up of the joint procurement, such as activities for awareness raising, networking, training, evaluation, validation and dissemination of results.
The proposal is expected to build on the outcomes coming from:
?	HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-15: Preparing for pre-commercial procurement (PCP) for end-user services based on environmental observation in the area of climate change adaptation and mitigation. The work done previously under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe (e.g., from e-shape, climate service projects and downstream services projects);
?	GEOSS initiatives.
The core of the consortium should be a qualified 'buyers group' (public procurement consortium), able to implement the action. Additional partners such as business/SME support organisations, innovation agencies or sectoral organisations may be included to assist procurers in knowing what is available on the market through market consultations.
The proposal should describe the jointly identified challenge, indicating how it fits into the mid-to-long-term innovation plans of the consortium, why solutions currently available on the market or under development are not meeting their needs, and put forward concrete targets for the desired functionality/performance improvement in the quality and efficiency of their public services.
The proposal should explain clearly how the creation of jobs, sustainable economic growth and new businesses will be assessed as an integral part of the successful application",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-6," Develop innovative applications to support the European Green Deal, building on meteorological satellite data",2/28/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 4.00-2,"Expected Outcome: A successful proposal will be delivering new environmental information through the exploitation of Earth observations and promote application development and pre-operational European services through cloud infrastructures, supporting the GEO engagement priorities and the objectives of the European Green Deal.
They should be in line with the European strategy for data and Europe?s Digital Decade, thus developing new advanced products, adding value to safety and healthy critical applications of environmental observations and contributing to a strengthened Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS)  and complementing or enhancing the Copernicus  services.
Proposals are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Uptake of the newly available environmental information and data at global and regional scale delivered through the Copernicus Sentinels and the EUMETSAT  ?Meteosat Third Generation (MTG)? and ?EUMETSAT Polar System Second Generation (EPS SG)?;
?	Preparation and implementation of high-quality (novel) satellite data products and applications using the next generation EUMETSAT and Copernicus instruments for the exploitation by advanced physical/chemical/biochemical models, and integrating in-situ data, to improve the implementation and operationalisation of new and advanced services and applications;
?	Demonstrated use of these applications for Earth Systems predictions, long-term climate monitoring (i.e., re-analysis within the Copernicus climate services context) and disaster risk prediction and reduction (e.g., within the framework of the Copernicus Emergency Management service);
?	Exploitation of the European cloud systems (e.g. Copernicus DIAS , European Open Science Cloud , European Weather Cloud) and a contribution to the Destination Earth initiative ;
?	Demonstrated use of satellite derived environmental information to advance and improve seamless climate-weather and environmental services in Europe, and potentially beyond.
Scope: The successful applications should take up and enhance the development of new environmental information based on the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) and EUMETSAT Polar System Second Generation (EPS SG) . They should explore pre-operational European services through the exploitation of new Earth Observation (EO), digital infrastructures and modelling capabilities.
In the coming years, the MTG and EPS SG satellites will provide an unprecedented view of the Earth System offering opportunities for developing weather, climate, air-quality and marine applications. Copernicus Sentinels 4 and 5 will be collocated within the MTG and EPS-SG payloads, offering an important opportunity to develop synergetic products.
Ongoing Copernicus and EUMETSAT missions will complement this observational framework. EUMETSAT will facilitate the access to these data to the successful applications under this topic.
Proposals should build on these and other missions (e.g., Sentinel), designing new methods and data products to exploit the synergies across instruments and platforms and showcase pilot services for public and private users. They should turn existing and future EO measurements into new environmental information. Co-registration of measurements should allow for optimising the information extraction, as for example the life cycle of extreme weather events through lightning, hyperspectral and other instruments hosted by geostationary payloads.
Synergies should be considered for across-payloads (geostationary and polar orbiting systems) measurements, and through the use of advanced algorithms, machine learning/artificial intelligence, data assimilation techniques and atmospheric models and artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques. This should contribute to the design of new products exploiting the full spectrum of possibilities (as for example integrating chemistry and water cycle observations into new products/ knowledge). The tools and services developed under the successful applications should be made available for future integration in the Copernicus programme and in the common topical European open infrastructure, Destination Earth. Open-source data/information requires open access to data that is associated with important benefits for the society and economy when reused. They should furthermore ensure the collaboration with EuroGEO  and the relevant EuroGEO projects as well as ESA initiatives (such as EO4SD ).
Successful applications should also develop applications using the new environmental data/information within key domains (e.g., urban and coastal management, air quality and health, disaster risk reduction, sustainable blue economy and climate adaptation/mitigation), as enhancements of already available services.
Attention should be given the sustained uptake of data/services or these satellites by the European commercial sector",
HORIZON-CL6-2024-GOVERNANCE-01-7, Enhancing working conditions and strengthening the work force through digital and data technologies ? the potential of robotics and augmented reality in agriculture,2/28/2024,RIA,10/17/2023,,,Around 5.00-3,"Expected Outcome: In line with the farm to fork strategy, the common agricultural policy post 2022, and the headline ambition of a Digital Age, a successful proposal will contribute to transition to a fair, healthy and resilient agriculture. It will therefore also directly and/ or indirectly contribute to the enhancement of the sustainability performance of the sector, including social sustainability, and competitiveness in agriculture through research and innovation which will support the further deployment of digital and data technologies as key enablers.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhanced working conditions in agriculture (including increased safety of workers and reduced drudgery) through innovative digital solutions exploiting the potential of augmented reality.
?	Lowered environmental impacts and productions costs and increased product quality in and through the use of digital technologies, through robotics and augmented reality in particular .
?	Reduced share of risky or unattractive actions/tasks to be performed by workers through automation-based solutions.
?	Mitigated shortage of work force in agriculture in some sub-sectors through automation-based solutions.
Scope: Digital and data technologies can facilitate the work in agriculture, enhance working conditions  and mitigate the challenge of a lack of work force, by which some branches and regions are affected. They have the potential of making farm-related jobs more attractive, including for younger generations, and to make them safer. Digital and data technologies can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of applications, including for instance through a higher level of precision, and thus increase the sustainability and competitiveness of the sector. Automation is increasingly used in agriculture; frequently, the cost-effectiveness of innovative digital and data technologies still presents a bottleneck to their use in the sector, particularly in fields where their application is not primarily relevant for increasing process efficiency and effectiveness. Technical solutions based on augmented reality approaches offer many opportunities to facilitate and enhance the use of digital technologies in agriculture, to enhance the performance of digital tools, and to provide remote assistance, which is important for remote businesses, particularly in rural areas.
Proposals should address the following:
?	Development of augmented-reality based solutions to improve working conditions, safety and failure avoidance, and to further increase robotic performance.
?	Development of robotic solutions to improve unhealthy working conditions, where applicable. Robotics tasks to be fostered might be directly related to agricultural production, such as harvesting, weeding, crop monitoring, animal husbandry or indirectly related, such as logistics/ farm management (TRL 7-8).
?	Development of robotic solutions for tasks, for which there is a high interest/ need to support and/ or replace the human work force, not only because of an interest to improve productivity, but to ensure production in an environmentally and socially sustainable way (TRL 7-8).
?	Strengthening AI capabilities for agro-robotics in the fields of applications fostered by the proposals including through the use of (scalable) platforms to further increase robotics performance (TRL 7-8).
?	Development of business models for the use of the developed innovative technologies under consideration of various farm structures and inter-farm linkages as well as of various biogeographic and socio-economic framing conditions.
?	Development of a tool for system analyses of the consequences for farmers and rural communities of enhancing working conditions through automation and augmented reality and of replacing human work force with robotic systems.
The development of such technologies should take into account relevant (forthcoming) EU legislation, in particular linked to the horizontal Act on AI, as well as the legislation related to liability and machinery. Projects are encouraged - when reflecting on the effects of automation and augmented reality - to dedicate particular attention to youth/ younger generation, women and persons with disabilities as well as to the affordability of digital solutions. Projects are expected to develop training material allowing the targeted end users and multipliers to easily deploy and promote the new technologies.
Proposals must implement the ?multi-actor approach? including a range of actors to ensure that knowledge and needs from various stakeholder groups, including farmers, farm workers, farm advisors and scientists are taken into consideration. This topic should involve the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines.
Projects are expected to take into consideration the results of other related Horizon 2020/ Europe projects as well as of other relevant EU-funded projects and initiatives.
Proposals may involve financial support to third parties, e.g. to academic researchers, hi-tech start-ups, SMEs, and other multidisciplinary actors, to for instance, develop, test or validate developed approaches, tools and applications or to provide other contributions to achieve the project objectives. Consortia need to define the selection process of organisations, for which financial support may be granted. A maximum of 20% of the EU funding can be allocated to this purpose.

They will address the necessity of primary producers for impartial and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience. They will also speed up innovation and the uptake of results, and will be key to improving sustainability.
They will contribute to effective Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS ), thereby adding value to the knowledge and cost-effectiveness of innovative practices and techniques in and across primary production sectors, food and bioeconomy systems, and lead to more informed and engaged stakeholders and users of project results.
Despite the continued funding of scientific projects, new knowledge, innovative ideas and methods from practice are not sufficiently captured and spread. The research findings are often not integrated into agricultural and forestry practice. The proposals, acting at EU level to remedy this, are essential because national and sectoral agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKISs) are insufficiently connected and organised to fully meet the challenge of intensifying thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. This exchange of knowledge will foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture and forestry and build trust between the main AKIS actors. It will scale local solutions up to the EU level and may even influence policy design wherever useful.

Contribution to the cross-cutting objective of the CAP on modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake  , as well as to the European Green Deal and farm to fork strategy objectives and targets, including climate change and carbon farming.
?	Collection and distribution of easily accessible practice-oriented knowledge on the thematic area chosen, in particular the existing innovative solutions, best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice, but not sufficiently known or used by practitioners.
?	Maintenance of practical knowledge in the long-term ? beyond the project period ? in particular by using the main trusted dissemination channels which farmers/foresters most often consult.
?	Increased flow of practical information between farmers/foresters in the EU in a geographically balanced way, creating spill-overs and taking account of the differences between territories.
?	Greater user acceptance of collected solutions and a more intensive dissemination of existing knowledge, by connecting actors, policies, projects and instruments to speed up innovation and promote the faster and wider co-creation and transposition of innovative solutions into practice.

This topic addresses the necessity of organic farming producers for impartial and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience. Successful proposals will speed up innovation and the uptake of results, and will contribute to effective Agriculture Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS ).
 Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:
?	Support for the implementation of the CAP?s cross-cutting objective of modernising the sector by fostering and sharing of knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas, and encouraging their uptake  , as well as the objectives of the Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production  related to the promotion of best practices and synergies with EIP-AGRI projects, enhancing knowledge exchange and strengthening AKIS;
?	Collection, distribution and dissemination to farmers of easily accessible practice-oriented knowledge focusing on organic farming, in particular the existing best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice;
?	Increased flow of practical information between farmers in the EU and Associated Countries in a geographically balanced way;
?	Greater user acceptance of collected solutions and a more intensive dissemination of existing knowledge.
Scope: Transformative changes, such as the ones called for by the farm to fork strategy and the European Green Deal, are dynamic and complex processes. This is particularly the case of organic farming, a more knowledge-intensive approach compared to more conventional ones. This topic aims at supporting the achievement of the farm to fork strategy target of at least 25% of the EU's agricultural land under organic farming by 2030, for which knowledge and best practice exchange among farmers and across the EU and Associated Countries are fundamental, as it is recognised in the action plan for the development of organic production . In this respect, it also aims to support climate change mitigation and adaptation, including carbon farming uptake. Despite the continued funding of scientific projects devoted specifically to address the challenges of organic farming, research findings are not sufficiently integrated into agricultural practice. Therefore, new knowledge and innovative ideas are not sufficiently shared with and adopted by organic farmers. Moreover, national and sectoral AKISs are insufficiently connected and organised to fully meet the challenge of intensifying thematic cooperation between researchers, advisors and farmers/foresters. The exchange of knowledge can foster economically viable and sustainable agriculture.
Proposals should focus on knowledge sharing that addresses the most urgent needs of organic farmers, involved in plant production and/or animal husbandry, for impartial and tailored knowledge on the management choices related to the needs, challenges or opportunities they experience in their specific contexts. The specific subthemes of the network should be chosen in a 'bottom-up' way. Proposals should focus on the cost/benefit aspects of the practices identified. End-user material for farmers should include conversion and business plans. The differences between countries/regions/territories should be duly taken into consideration.
In this context, proposals should:
?	Describe comprehensively the state of available knowledge of organic farming practices on the chosen theme and justify the added-value and the relevance of the theme, and explaining how duplication with ongoing or completed projects and networks is avoided.
?	Summarise, share and present ? in a language that is easy to understand and is targeted to farmers ? the existing best practices and research findings that are ready to be put into practice.
?	Deliver an extensive range of useful, applicable and appealing material for organic farmers. This material should be easy to access and understand, making use of audio-visual material wherever possible, including also materials serving education and training. The material should feed into existing dissemination channels most consulted by farmers in the different countries.
?	Provide ?practice abstracts? in the common EIP-AGRI format, as well as other type of materials, to the European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability', as well as to national/regional/local AKIS channels and to the EU-wide interactive knowledge reservoir (HORIZON-CL6-2021-GOVERNANCE-01-24).
?	In addition to giving the details on the EIP Operational Groups which are strongly recommended to be involved , wherever possible and relevant to organic farming, provide also details on how further synergies will be built with future EIP Operational Groups and interactive innovation groups operating in the context of the EIP-AGRI.
?	Ensure the long-term - beyond the project period - availability of the practical knowledge collected.
Proposals must implement the 'multi-actor approach', with a consortium based on a balanced mix of actors with complementary knowledge clearly building on organic farmers, farmers' groups and advisors, and should run for a minimum of 3 years. Proposals may organise 'cross-fertilisation' through sub-networks covering, for example, a region, a language or a production system, in order to better reach and capture knowledge from the targeted farmers and to address context-specific challenges. Outcomes should be widely spread beyond the organic farming community and reach also farmers involved in carbon farming, low-input farming, circular agriculture or agroecology.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will ensure synergies with the activities carried out by projects selected under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE-01-20: ?Developing an EU advisory network on organic agriculture?, HORIZON-CL6-2024-FARM2FORK-02-1-two-stage: ?Increasing the availability and use of non-contentious inputs in organic farming?, and HORIZON-CL6-2023-FARM2FORK-01-3: ?Improving yields in organic cropping systems? in this Work Programme.

Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKIS) in which advisors are fully integrated are key drivers to speed up innovation and the uptake of research results by farmers.
Transformative changes such as the changes required within the European Green Deal are dynamic processes that require appropriate governance of AKIS actors. Advisors are key actors with a role in providing strong guidance and with a big influence over producers? decisions. A novelty in the post-2020 CAP plans  is that advisors now must be integrated within the Member States? AKIS, and that the scope of their actions has become much broader.

?	Climate-resilient solutions dedicated to small farms, organic farms or farms in conversion or any type of farms looking for alternative to intensive agriculture are enabled, contributing to the implementation of the Farm to Fork Strategy.
Scope: This topic relates to the Mission?s objectives to mobilise at least 150 regions in testing the solutions most locally needed to build climate resilience and to deliver at least 75 deep demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience.
The proposal should develop and test innovative solutions, combining technological, social and business innovation, leading to an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change in the involved regions and communities of the agriculture sector and the

related value chains. Nature based solutions10 and the restoration of cropland and grassland should be explored as priority and at the very heart of the development whenever possible.
The proposed solution should address at least some of the following aspects:

?	Improving resilience of the agriculture and /or forestry sector, improving the capacity of the sector to withstand dry periods and extreme droughts while protecting the ecological flows, preserving biodiversity in and around the catchment channels, preserving longitudinal connectivity of the flowing streams, slowing the falling level of the groundwater table and reversing the loss of biodiversity. This should include for example exploring value of culture rotation and other means to improve soil quality, improving soil structure by circular approaches, establishment and maintenance of landscape features (for example such as hedges reducing wind erosion), innovative silvo- pasture, management of genetic resources in an agro-ecological perspective and other agro-ecology approaches in farmland, in particular in relation to droughts and water multi-usage and management;
?	Exploiting agro-ecology as an approach to enhance the climate resilience of the farming system, its functionality and sustainability, while bringing sustainable solutions and multiple benefits, such as enhanced yields from adapted food crops, water efficiency, enhanced farmer livelihoods from income generation, increased biodiversity, improved water quality and water use efficiency, the ecological status of waters, improved soil structure and health, reduced erosion, and/or a higher level of carbon sequestration.
?	Exploring integration of available smart farming approaches (and improvements of the same based on updated data) and the use of technologies as the AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve climate resilience through the modification and improvement of nutrient and crop protection processes, such as fertilization, pest control and irrigation, to ensure sufficient crop yields both in terms of quality and quantity, while also reducing emissions, water consumption and preserving biodiversity.
?	Development of more natural ecosystems, generating combined benefits for climate mitigation, reduction of water flooding and soil erosion, (by increasing recurring to green infrastructures, tree planting, or increasing of permeable green surfaces) and maintaining or restoring rivers, peatland, wetland and natural floodplain.
?	Further demonstrate and increase awareness of the value of maintaining and restoring existing natural systems, preservation of cultural landscapes and socio-ecological systems as proving rich spectrum of climate services compared to other anthropogenic solutions, including integration of cultural heritage considerations as the legacy from the past, to be experienced in the present, and for transmitting to future generations. In line with the Mission Implementation Plan and the new EU Climate Adaptation Strategy, implementing nature-based solutions with adequate social and environmental standards on a larger scale would increase climate resilience. Blue-green (as opposed to grey) infrastructures represent multipurpose, ?no regret? solutions, which simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build climate resilience, which uptake can be facilitated by better quantification and communication of their benefits. Nature based Solutions (NBS) essential role for sustaining healthy water, oceans and soils was recognised, together with their potential to reduce costs, provide climate-resilient services, and improve compliance with Water Framework Directive requirement for good ecological status, if they were to play a bigger role in land-use management and infrastructure planning. The forthcoming Nature Restoration Law will also play an important role in requiring MS to plan restoration activities across a range of ecosystems.
As climate impacts, adaptive capacities and disaster risk reduction capabilities differ greatly across regions, the proposed development and innovation should address specific needs identified at regional and local scale (both at the rural, urban-rural interface and eventually in urban context) with tailor-made responses and measures, fully acknowledging place-based governance, socio-economic and identity characteristics and other place-based data.
In line with the Mission objective to build systemic climate resilience, the proposal should address the multi-risks locally identified, design and implement a systemic solution to reduce the identified vulnerabilities of the agriculture and/or forestry sector to climate change and to mitigate its negative potential impacts.
Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged. To this purpose, the proposals must include at least 4 demonstrations taking place in regions/local authorities/ communities, which should collaborate in addressing the common climate change challenges identified and in testing the most suitable solutions. These at least 4 demonstrations must be located in at least 3 different EU Member States and/ or Horizon Europe associated countries. Involvement in the proposal of regions eligible for Cohesion funds11 to conduct at least one of the proposed demonstrations shall be regarded as a positive element.
The proposals should clearly identify the biogeographical area, for which the proposed solution is relevant and to which the proposal is focussed. Moreover, the proposal should explore possible reapplication to other regions, starting from those located in the same biogeographical areas.
To support a large impact, the proposed solutions should be widely re-applicable. To this purpose, identification and inclusion of at least three ?replicating? regions/local

authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is strongly encouraged; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the ?replicating? regions.
In addition to the local/regional authorities owning the climate challenge, the consortium may include other type of partners, such as private or public research organisations, enterprises and NGOs, to ensure that all needed capabilities are available to develop and implement real life actions.
Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by European and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Moreover, proposals should look into opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across in Europe through the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, and through the European Regional Development Fund programmes.
Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links with the Climate-ADAPT platform (run by the European Environment Agency (EEA) together with DG CLIMA) that will act as a central element for the monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in European Regions. To this purpose, projects will feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.
Projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in the Mission Community of Practice that will be established amongst the Mission Charter signatories and and in networking and joint activities with other projects funded under other topics in the Mission Climate Adaptation as well as in other relevant Missions and partnerships, as appropriate. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources. Beyond the Mission, the projects funded under this topic are also encouraged to exchange and identify cooperation opportunities with other projects funded under Horizon Europe, in particular those funded under Cluster 6, the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe and the future partnership on agro- ecology living labs.
The European Commission intends to establish a network and coordination activities amongst all the projects funded for the implementation of the Climate adaptation Mission, under the Horizon 2020 European Green Deal call and under Horizon Europe, and that will be coordinated by the soon to be established Mission Implementation Platform. The projects under this topic will be requested to contribute to this effort. Applicants should acknowledge this request and already account for these obligations in their proposal, making adequate

provisions in terms of resources and budget to engage and collaborate with the Mission governance.

Nature based solutions16 (with adequate social and environmental standards) protecting infrastructure from adverse effects of climate change have been developed, tested and brought closer to the market, increasing evidence for their viability and business potential. Green, climate neutral and zero pollution technology solutions are broadly supported and opportunities for further inter-sectorial cooperation are fostered.
?	Potential economic and social losses caused by extreme weather events and interruption of service due to critical infrastructures becoming unavailable are reduced, making the economy and the society as a whole more resilient through better preparation.
?	Businesses, public and private actors are made more prepared to cope with the changing climate, also through climate adaptation targeted education and training, up- and re- skilling programmes.
?	Prevention and management of emergency events linked to adverse climate effects is improved, thanks to ?by design? integration of digital monitoring and relevant data sources in the solutions.
Scope: This topic relates to the Mission?s objectives to mobilise at least 150 regions in testing the solutions most locally needed to build climate resilience and to deliver at least 75 deep demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience.
It complements the Climate Adaptation Mission topic 2021-CLIMA-02-03, which focussed on modelling aspects, as it mainly addresses demonstration of solutions on the ground, therefore providing a relevant context to eventually take further promising approaches already identified.
The proposal should identify weaknesses and interlinkages of critical infrastructures, in order to develop and test innovative solutions, combining technological and social innovation, leading to an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change in the involved regions, local authorities and communities, assuring that nature-based solutions are explored as priority and at the very heart of the development whenever possible.

The resilience of nature-based solutions to climate change should also be taken into account.
As climate impacts, adaptive capacities and disaster risk reduction capabilities differ greatly across regions, the proposed scientific development and innovation should address specific needs identified at regional and local scale with tailor-made responses and measures, fully

17	Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)

acknowledging place-based governance, socio-economic and identity characteristics and other place-based data. The successful methodologies and protocols are expected to be adapted to other regions, for further uptake.
In line with the Mission objective to build systemic climate resilience, the proposal should address the local vulnerabilities in order to mitigate the potential risks on the infrastructure being it as potential natural disasters, extreme weather events or long-term changes in average climate), as well as their potential negative impacts on critical assets and infrastructures and the interdependencies between those.
For example, the acceleration of deployment of renewable energy is not without consequences on other environmental and geopolitical challenges. The interdependency of water and energy is set to intensify in the coming years, with significant implications for both energy and water security. Coal and gas power plants require a lot of water, but also renewable sources could increase water stress or be challenged by it, either during operation or during the construction stage. For instance, hydropower requires water to be operated, so that droughts and water shortages that are foreseen in the future for the Southern member states may significantly affect its generation capacity, while the increased water availability in the Northern states is expected to increase hydropower generation potential. Simultaneously, hydropower reservoirs can help in mitigating floods and store water, providing it during droughts. While wind or solar technologies require little water for their operation, but a significant amount (per installed power capacity) during their manufacturer process, biofuels, concentrated solar power , carbon capture, renewable hydrogen produced through electrolysis or even low- carbon technologies like nuclear are water-intensive. Understanding these interlinkages and develop and test solutions is therefore critical for the resilience of our economy and society, and to reduce sources of conflict.
Similarly, the achievement of a more interconnected Europe faces key challenges in the development of the interconnected transport networks and corridors, as changing groundwater levels, coastal storms frequency and their spatial incurrence, extreme temperatures, accelerated coastal erosion linked to sea level rise can have very negative effects on stability of rail and road infrastructures in coastal areas (clearly, this also affecting the development and lay down of energy and water networks laid in the proximity of coastal areas).
On that basis, the proposal should design and test solutions with the potential to reduce negative impacts both of long terms climate change and also of sudden extreme events attributable to climate change.
More specifically, the proposed solution should address:

?	Protecting critical infrastructure from climate impacts and make it ready to withstand the changing climate and its consequences, in particular in terms of maintaining efficiency of operations, minimizing downtime, reducing maintenance costs and protecting the capital invested;

?	Solutions for building and/or managing new critical infrastructure and/or upgrading/regenerating/revitalising/refurbishing existing ones through green/blue/hybrid infrastructure and if needed different governance structures, in particular in relation to climate-proofing it towards extreme events. Lifecycle ecological and CO2 footprint considerations, from sourcing the materials, including water and energy needed, through transportation of the material, building, maintenance and utilisation, should be embedded in the decision concerning the type of infrastructure approach to pursue;
?	Inclusion of digital solutions and services to better predict, monitor and report on climate events, in particular towards improve forecasts of adverse events and triggering adequate risk management and emergency procedures, to protect both business and population, in particular the most vulnerable and marginalised, taking into consideration the interconnections between critical infrastructures and their operation;
Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/ communities facing similar climate risks and similar infrastructure challenges are highly encouraged. To this purpose, the proposals must include at least 4 demonstrations taking place in at least 4 regions/cities/communities, which should collaborate in addressing the challenge. These (at least) 4 demonstrations must be located in at least 3 different EU Member States and/or Horizon Europe associated countries. Involvement in the proposal of regions eligible for Cohesion funds18 to conduct at least one of the proposed demonstrations shall be regarded as a positive element. In agreement with the authorities responsible for the territories where the actions will be implemented, the consortium should develop a scalability plan including the diffusion of the innovative solutions, and a process for commitments (including funding and governance) in assuring their large-scale deployment and long-term operation beyond the time-life of the project itself. The consortium should seek guarantees for the non-reversibility, sustainability and continuity of the action after the end of the project.
The proposals should clearly identify the biogeographical area, for which the proposed solution is relevant and should explore possible reapplication to other regions, starting from those located in the same biogeographical areas. To support a large impact, the proposed solutions should be widely re-applicable. To this purpose, identification and inclusion of at least three ?replicating? regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is strongly encouraged; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the ?replicating? regions.

?	regions, local authorities and communities have been involved in development and testing of a whole range of transformative solutions that will help to mitigate the effect of climate change on health and human wellbeing, including making the public health sector more climate resilient and better prepared to mitigate the climate change related health challenges.
?	climate resilience solutions that protect human health have been developed, tested and are made largely available
Scope: This topic relates to the Mission?s objectives to mobilise at least 150 regions in testing the solutions most locally needed to build climate resilience and to deliver at least 75 deep demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience.
The proposals should test and demonstrate solutions that address both the two aspects below, including in the scope at least some of the individual points related to improve prevention and policy-making and at least some points related to improve preparedness of the health system.
1.	Improve prevention and policy-making, by:

?	Improved insights into short- and long-term health effects of climate-related stressors, including planetary health considerations (interactions between global climate change, ecosystem, animal and human health as described in the One Health concept). Taking into consideration differences between infectious and non- communicable diseases, and the particularities of each. With regard to the infectious diseases, emphasis should be given on the surveillance and prevention of zoonotic diseases. These improved insights should made available and be integrated by the regional and local authorities in their planning. The European Climate and Health Observatory can contribute to these efforts and, reversely, learnings from the projects supported under this topic would contribute to the Observatory knowledge basis.
?	Strengthening comprehensive and user friendly epidemiological surveillance and modelling and forecasting tools, including socio-economic trajectories and adaptation scenarios of exposure and vulnerability to climate determinants. These tools should be suitable for assessing and predicting impact of moderate, extreme and record-breaking events and disasters associated with climate change, including impacts on mental health. Environmental stressors should also be considered when relevant for the prevention of major non-communicable such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases e.g. combination of heat waves and air pollution or increase in pollens. Surveillance, modelling and forecasting tools should be piloted in the partner regions and communities. Reflecting the One Health concept, the link between animal health impacts due to climate change and subsequent human health impacts should also be considered, when relevant.

?	Development of better forecast, early-warning and early response systems and decision-making models for health impacts of climate change which are able to monitor both the impact and the effectiveness of solutions.
?	Development and health impact assessment of adaptation measures and monitoring of effectiveness of solutions to improve resilience of countries, regions and cities, including effective nature-based solutions (NBS).
2.	Improve preparedness of health systems by:

?	Development of innovative solutions (technological solutions, NBS, etc) to reduce impact of climate change on human health and wellbeing. Heat and cold waves and floods should be among the stressors considered, but proposals should not limit their work to only these two stressors and might consider the association with environmental conditions such as the association of heat waves and air quality or exposure to pollens. Solutions should be designed with a win-win objective so to not have a negative effect on climate mitigation efforts, after sufficient consideration of positive and negative interactions.
?	Preparing training curricula on health and climate change for medical and other healthcare professionals across Europe. The proposed curricula should be trailed in the partner regions, local authorities and communities, training pilot group of professionals.
?	Development of innovative, fit-for-purpose, end-user driven early warning and response systems or improving existing ones, including a demonstration of their predictive/response capacity, to ensure a rapid response from health services and civil protection authorities and testing/pilot such systems in the partner regions/local authorities/communities.
?	Providing feedback and sharing best practice from pilots to the new Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority. Such tests should be accompanied by public awareness campaigns in relation to climate forecasts and health early warning systems, identifying the warning communication chain, role, tasks and responsibilities of science advisors and decision-makers.
Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/ communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged. To this purpose, the proposals must include at least 4 regions/local authorities/ communities, which should collaborate in addressing the common challenge identified and conducting demonstration activities of the most suitable solutions.

?	Researchers and health professionals understand tumour-host processes that spur cancer development and progression in patients and how this forms the basis for the future design and optimisation of treatment or care interventions for poorly-understood cancers and their subtypes, including in children, adolescents, adults and the elderly.
?	Researchers and innovators from different disciplines and sectors support the development of the UNCAN.eu36 platform by producing, integrating and correlating comprehensive data from multiple sources.
?	Researchers, innovators, and health professionals ensure accessibility and re-usability of data, models and tools created.
?	Health policy makers are aware of an improved understanding of tumour-host interactions in cancer patients that would allow the co-design of cancer-related innovation and health policies in the Member States, Associated Countries and beyond, including those aimed at delivering treatment and care developing care solutions for and with cancer patients.
Scope: This topic will contribute to the achievement of the mission?s objective to better understand cancer. Tumour-host interactions underpinning the development and progression of cancer, including in advanced localised or metastatic disease. The focus should be on poorly-understood 37 cancers and their subtypes in children, adolescents, adults and the elderly.
Despite important progress and recent successes with, for example immune system-centred therapeutic interventions, such as cell-based and oncolytic viral therapy, therapeutic antibodies, therapeutic DNA, RNA and peptide vaccines; and multimodal interventions combining surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy with immune system-centred interventions, understanding of tumour-host interactions in cancer patients remains incomplete. Challenges include which patients benefit from interventions and risk potentially debilitating side-effects, affordability of interventions across Europe, in children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. This requires a new dimension and level of investment in innovative research with a view to intercept disease, including high-risk, high-reward research projects to deliver a proof-of-concept of potentially disruptive new approaches in monitoring treatment and disease progression and disclosing disease pathways, such as through single-cell -omics technologies, advanced imaging technologies, or artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Proposals should address all of the following:

?	Obtain a systematic understanding of processes underpinning tumour-host interactions in poorly-understood cancers and their subtypes in childhood, adolescent, adult and elderly cancer patients. Applicants should take into account social, ethnical, cultural and gender aspects, with a focus on the transition from a healthy state to cancer initiation and progression, including in advanced localised or metastatic disease (where relevant), using any relevant in silico, in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo, preclinical, or clinical disease models as well as computational, simulation and visualisation tools and technologies where appropriate.
?	Combine knowledge and high-quality data from biomedical and clinical studies, and real-world data, using advanced digital tools and technologies such as computer modelling and artificial intelligence with the objective to understand relevant tumour- host interactions and their impact on treatment and care solutions for cancer patients.
?	Demonstrate access to and use of multiple comprehensive databases in and beyond health research or health domains. Proposals should build on longitudinal clinically annotated, stratified patient cohorts, case-control studies, biobanks, registries and many other initiatives 38 , use state-of-the art digital and other tools for data analyses and modelling, wherever possible.
?	Based on results obtained, propose socially accepted novel treatment or care interventions or health technologies for uptake into health systems in the areas of treatment or care through approaches that involve the end-user through participative research models.
?	The Commission may facilitate Mission-specific coordination through future actions, notably fostering exchanges with other proposals funded under this topic. Due consideration should be given to EU-funded initiatives such as: HealthyCloud39, EOSC- Life40, the Photonics21 partnership ? including its Photon Hub Europe support service41, the Innovative Health Initiative partnership42, the European Health Data Space (EHDS) Joint Action 43 , 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) 44 / Beyond One Million Genomes (B1MG) 45 , the EBrains 46 research infrastructure and the EIT Health Knowledge Innovation Community initiatives 47 . Links with projects funded through topics HORIZON-INFRA-EOSC-2021-01-06 (FAIR and open data sharing in support of cancer research) and HORIZON-INFRA-SERV-2021-01-01 (Research infrastructures services to support research addressing cancer) as well as projects funded by other EU programmes48 are encouraged.
Successful applicants will be asked to liaise with these and other  initiatives  where applicable 49 . The successful proposals should build on resources made available by the Knowledge Centre on Cancer50.
Therefore, proposals should include a budget for networking, attendance to meetings, and potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail those at this stage. For example, the organisation of joint workshops, exchange of knowledge, establish best practices, or joint communication activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. The details of joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase and project duration.

Scope: With about 40% of cancer cases being preventable51, prevention represents the most cost-efficient and sustainable cancer control strategy. The Mission on Cancer and the Europe?s Beating Cancer Plan aim to exploit the potential of primary cancer prevention by addressing key risk factors and health determinants52.
Achieving sustainable behaviour change can play a major role in enhancing the impact of health promotion and preventive measures and thus contribute to reducing the number of preventable cancer cases. Despite having access to peer-reviewed existing evidence and recommendations53 on cancer prevention, widely accepted by policymakers across the EU, their uptake to effectively changing behaviour needs to be enhanced.
In the past, evidence on how to achieve behaviour change, has not been sufficiently taken into account when designing health promotion and primary prevention programmes, as behaviour change is a complex challenge subject to manifold influences that should be better understood at individual and system levels, through public engagement and interdisciplinary approaches.
This requires a systemic approach involving all the main actors at different levels who can facilitate sustainable behaviour change including public authorities, policymakers, health care providers, employers, educational institutions, industry, non-governmental consumer and patient organisations, citizens and media.
Investments are needed to establish, scale-up or improve health promotion and cancer prevention programmes through increased awareness among citizens about cancer risk factors and related behaviour change, with a focus on hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups of the population.
Proposals should further address all of the following:

?	Develop, test and evaluate the effective impacts of innovative primary cancer prevention programmes, possibly through the use of novel, including digital, solutions 54 , for different population groups which should be involved in the design;
?	Provide evidence-based cost-benefit analyses of the proposed programmes;
?	Identify and address specific bottlenecks and barriers that prevent the uptake of sustainable behaviour change for different target populations, taking into account sectorial, socio-economic, cultural and geographical55 conditions as well as gender and age;
?	Identify the most appropriate actors and develop incentives promoting sustainable behaviour change, such as increasing the uptake of the European Code against Cancer56;
?	Assess and validate parameters and factors facilitating or impeding behavioural change, and measure their impact;
?	In addition, attention should be paid to health determinants, including occupational and environmental factors (e.g. pollution), education, socio-economic status, gender, age, and inequalities in access to prevention programmes, affecting for example elderly people, people with disabilities, or minorities and people living in rural areas.
?	Approaches how to best reach and involve disadvantaged socio-economic population groups, vulnerable groups, and people living in rural areas,should be developed.
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Applicants should demonstrate awareness of relevant evidence on behaviour change and behavioural insight57. The Commission may facilitate Mission-specific coordination through future actions. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for networking, attendance to meetings, and potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail those at this stage. For example, the organisation of joint workshops, exchange of knowledge, establish best practices, or joint communication activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate. The Commission will take on the role of facilitator for networking and exchanges, including with proposals funded under this topic and relevant initiatives and stakeholders. The funded actions should build upon resources made available by the Knowledge Centre on Cancer58.
The details of joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. Of particular interest in this context are the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission, the EU Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? as well as the successful proposals resulting from the topics HORIZON-MISS-2022-CANCER-01-01, ?Improving and upscaling primary prevention of cancer through implementation research?, to be known by early 2023, and HORIZON-CL6- 2021-FARM2FORK-01-15, ?Transition to healthy and sustainable dietary behaviour?. Activities should, where appropriate, complement the EU Non-Communicable Diseases Initiative ?Healthier together?59",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-CANCER-01-03, Pragmatic clinical trials on minimally invasive diagnostics,4/12/2023,RIA,1/12/2023,,,6.00 to 8.00-7,"Expected Outcome: Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Cancer patients and their caregivers have access to optimised and affordable, minimally- invasive diagnostic interventions that increase their quality of life, across European regions, Member States and Associated Countries;
?	Healthcare professionals and academia deliver better outcomes through routine healthcare, including quality of life, for men and women with cancer who often suffer from sex-related co-morbidities and side-effects;
?	National healthcare providers, policymakers and authorities in European Regions, Member States and Associated Countries will have the evidence to implement optimised and affordable minimally-invasive diagnostics in their healthcare systems, including in everyday medical practice.
Scope: While cancer research and innovation have generated novel treatment options, cancer patients across Europe need access to minimally-invasive, patient-centred diagnostic interventions which keep up with increasing demand in a complex and fragmented oncology healthcare landscape with increasing healthcare costs.
Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic with its detrimental impact on cancer control has demonstrated the need for different clinical trial designs with fewer inclusion and exclusion criteria that would allow evaluation of real-world effectiveness, driving better and affordable diagnostic solutions that are widely accessible across European regions, Member States and Associated Countries.
Healthcare professionals and academia generate clinical evidence, by evaluating effectiveness in randomised or cluster-randomised academic investigator-initiated 60 pragmatic clinical trials, on how to best perform and deploy evidence-based, minimally-invasive diagnostic interventions.
Pragmatic clinical trials focus on choosing between care options. Pragmatic trials evaluate effectiveness, the effect of diagnostics in routine (real-world) clinical practice.
Proposals should address all of the following:

?	Design and conduct randomised or cluster-randomised academic investigator-initiated pragmatic clinical trials to deliver effective and evidence-based diagnostic interventions for implementation by healthcare systems at the level of local communities, European regions, Member States and Associated Countries, taking into account stratification, such as biology, molecular features, sex & gender, cancer stage, and age. Clinical trial design and conduct could be aided by computational, simulation and visualisation tools and technologies where appropriate.
?	The chosen diagnostic intervention(s) should be adapted to the particular needs of the target population and to the specificities of the provision of care at local, regional, or national level, duly reflecting the diversity across Member States and Associated Countries. Furthermore, affordability and accessibility should be taken into account.
?	The successful proposals should clearly justify and describe the evidence supporting the chosen diagnostic intervention.
?	The primary and secondary endpoints of the pragmatic clinical trial should support overall survival, patient-preferred clinical benefit, patient-reported outcomes and quality of life issues considered important by and for cancer patients and their caregivers.
?	Such endpoints should be defined together with patients and their caregivers through research that uses open knowledge, (social) innovation systems and support end-user engagement, such as living labs61 or other participative research models.
?	Implementers of pragmatic clinical trials and trial results should include relevant stakeholders such as physicians, academia, patients and their caregivers, patient representatives, SMEs, insurance companies, charities and foundations, research organisations, civil society, regional and national research, innovation and health authorities.
?	Successful pragmatic clinical trials, including their analyses, should be completed within 5 years after the start of the project. Translational research is not within the scope of this topic.
?	In all instances, sex- and gender-related issues must be taken into account. All data should be disaggregated by sex, gender, age and other relevant variables, such as by measures of socio-economic status or ethnicity.

?	Childhood cancer patients, survivors and their families benefit from enhanced quality of life through better supportive care, personalised counselling approaches, and digital tools. Consequently, they can better achieve their values and personal life goals.
?	Health care professionals, supportive workers and councillors enhance the quality of life for childhood cancer patients, survivors and their families.
Scope: Best practices and tools to improve the quality of life for survivors of childhood cancer exist at national, regional and local level. These practices and tools should be scaled up or deployed in regions in at least three different Member States or Associated Countries in order to serve as demonstrators for wider uptake.
Proposals should address all of the following:

?	Best practices and validated tools (such as digital tools) related to for example education, sports, employment, medical follow-up including mental and physical health and well- being, or reproductive matters, should be tested and scaled up in regions in at least three different Member States or Associated Countries;
?	Address hurdles, factors and situations that impede implementation of good practices and tools in real-life settings with the intention to make life of childhood cancer survivors easier and better. Effectiveness and general applicability should be assessed and evaluated to provide enhanced real solutions in practice;
?	Attention should be paid to social and health determinants, including sex, gender, age and other relevant variables, such as socio-economic status and education;
?	Several best practices and tools should be chosen and scaled up together with childhood cancer survivors and their families. The use of participative research models, such as oncology-centred living labs62 or other approaches to deliver (social) innovation should be considered.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-01, European Blue Parks ? Protection and restoration of marine habitats,9/20/2023,IA,1/17/2023,,,Around 8.80-1,"Expected Outcome: To support the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Biodiversity Strategy and the Nature Restoration Law, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Effectively managed marine protected areas with clear science-based conservation objectives and conservation measures that contribute to the restoration and protection of marine ecosystems and support a shift towards strictly protected areas;
?	Protection and restoration of marine habitats and species through strictly protected areas, in particular of seabed habitats, including to preserve their carbon sequestration capacity, ensure spill-over of fish, provide ecosystem functionality and maintain connectivity;
?	Enhanced resilience and adaptation potential of coastal and marine ecosystems and improved provision of their ecosystem services, in particular in relation to climate change mitigation/adaptation and to fisheries;
?	A blueprint for the designation and management of marine protected areas and/or for shifting their status from ?protected? to ?strictly protected? including criteria and tools for quantifying their success/ effectiveness in terms of conservation outcomes/results; a blueprint for the identification of ecological corridors as part of a blue Trans-European Nature Network;
?	Active support to the Mission?s Digital Ocean and Water Knowledge system through advances in biological, ecosystem and socio-economic knowledge applied to restoration;
?	Reinforced EU leadership in international efforts to stop and reverse biodiversity loss, in line with the EU key priorities and international commitments.

Scope: Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 1 - Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ?development and piloting? phase and 2030 for the ?deployment and upscaling phase?.
Proposals under this topic will develop and demonstrate protection and restoration solutions to address the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems. Proposals should significantly improve the management of marine protected areas in particular through definition of clear science-based conservation objectives and implementation of the necessary conservation measures to achieve those objectives. Amongst the conservation measures, proposals should entail implementation of passive restoration actions through e.g.: strict protection, either as a newly designated strictly protected areas or as part of the zoning in the existing marine protected areas. Proposals should address the whole marine ecosystem functioning in the designated area, including the seabed and its role in carbon storage and as fish spawning and nursery area. Nevertheless, in well justified cases, proposals may address either specific vulnerable species or habitats that are under strong pressures or that have the most potential to capture and store carbon. Proposals could consider and assess pros and cons of some active restoration activities whereby native habitat building species would be reintroduced in degraded marine and coastal habitats to facilitate the natural recovery.
Proposals should be site-specific, and the scale and range of the protected area for demonstration activities has to be ecologically relevant and impactful. At the same time, proposals should show a significant replication potential.
When identifying and restoring degraded areas, particular attention needs to be paid to ensuring that the ecosystem services these areas can provide are resilient to climate change and that the areas are adequately protected to prevent new degradation. Proposals should develop innovative, efficient and cost-effective tools and methods to measure the conservation results/outcomes in terms of improvements of biodiversity in demonstration areas.
The proposals should also address the creation and long term maintenance of adequate conditions for habitats and/or for the movement of individuals and more generally species and for increasing ecosystems? capacity to adapt to climate change. Proposals should cover a wide range of ecosystem functions and services using a coherent and systemic approach and avoid the risk of trade-offs of focusing on one or very few ecosystem services at the expense of others. In this respect, seabed protection and restoration should be integrated, including preservation of seabed carbon sequestration capacity. The approach proposed has to show the potential to be up-scaled and reproduced at European level and beyond and develop a scalability plan.
The proposed innovation actions for the Blue Parks should seek the most effective and efficient management and supporting technologies to enable strict protection as restoration

measure and will closely follow the EU Guidance to Members States on the designation of additional protected or strictly protected areas82.
Proposals are expected to contribute to the implementation of the existing legislation related to MPAs, notably the Birds, Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. Proposals may consider marine Natura 2000 sites established under the Birds and Habitats Directives as well as explore new areas to reach the targets of protecting 30% of EU marine area by 2030, of which one third should be strictly protected.
National and local authorities and coastal communities should be involved in the design and implementation of innovative solutions to ensure that these solutions are successfully implemented in the long-term. Citizen engagement is a pillar concept for the Mission and a key element in relation to conservation and restoration actions. Activities should, therefore, use innovative participatory management practices, citizen-science initiatives and awareness- raising actions to promote a proactive involvement of local communities including scientists, land and sea use planners, marine protected area managers, and other stakeholders, to enable co-creation of solutions. Awareness raising actions to inspire and generate co-ownership for protection of local habitat and biodiversity should be included as well as collaboration with existing initiatives. Citizen engagement related activities should also be gender-responsive and socially inclusive.
Proposals are expected to contribute to the implementation of the existing legislation, notably in relation to Natura 2000 and Marine Protected Areas, as well as to provide recommendations addressing environmental or anthropogenic pressures and how to overcome them. Governance issues could be examined as a way to ensure effectiveness of protection and conservation measures. Activities improving the state of vulnerable ecosystem conditions are expected to be integrated into best practices or innovative monitoring within relevant monitoring governance schemes.
Proposals should build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system which will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the Blue Parks technical support platform which enables the reporting, monitoring, and coordination of all relevant implementation activities. In this regard, projects should cooperate closely with projects funded under Mission Ocean topic HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-01 and topic HORIZON-MISS-2022-OCEAN-01-01.
Proposals should build upon existing knowledge systems and upon the Mission Digital and Water Knowledge system for access to data, monitoring and forecasts and knowledge dissemination. The proposals should also build on research and innovation developed by projects financed under the current and/or previous EU framework programmes (Horizon 2020, in particular FutureMARES, MaCoBios and Rest-Coast projects, LIFE, EMFF/EMFAF), national and regional programmes (e.g. Interreg 2021-2027 / EU Macroregional Strategies) as well as on the activities of the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership and the Biodiversa+ Partnership.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-02, Danube river basin lighthouse ? Demonstration of effective and sustainable management of sediments in the Danube river-Black sea system,9/20/2023,IA,1/17/2023,,,Around 8.50-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Contribution to the implementation of the European Green Deal and the Water Framework Directive and related guidance documents as well as other EU instruments and policies that concern freshwater ecosystem protection, in particular to the implementation of the Updated River Basin Management Plan for Danube84 (2021) as regards sustainable sediment management in the Danube river basin;
?	Demonstrated sustainable and effective solutions for sediment management at a river basin scale, including solutions for the restoration of sediment balance and, quality and flow in the Danube river-Black sea system;
?	Measurable improvements in the quality (including presence of harmful chemicals, plastics and microplastics) and quantity of sediments flows demonstrate the effectiveness of the measures and solutions implemented;
?	Improved transnational and trans-sectoral cooperation between national authorities and other actors involved in sediment management at river basin scale; ?	Scaling up of solutions for sustainable river basin scale management of sediments in other European river basins through an involvement of river basin management bodies and ?associated regions?.
Scope: Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 1 - Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ?development and piloting? phase and 2030 for the ?deployment and upscaling phase?.
Sediments, a key component of river ecosystems, provide habitats to many aquatic organisms, regulate the morphology and shape of river basin and provide key ecosystem services. Pollutants can accumulate in sediments and, once displacements occur, disperse with them throughout the entire river basin. Human activities that affect natural river flow and continuity, such as flood protection measures, commercial sediment excavation, hydropower and navigation, alter sediment balance and transport within the river basin. Land-based activities such as agriculture, are also major drivers of alterations in sediment regime. This interference results in decreased sediment flow in free flowing river sections and in a sediment surplus in impounded sections increasing the risk of damage to infrastructure and human dwellings, besides reducing the effectiveness and raising maintenance costs. Also, sediment quality, in particular the degree of pollution levels, plays an important role in achieving good ecological status of river waters. Effective sediment management at a river basin scale requires trans-national, cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, sediment management accounts for the different demands on sediments; it considers relevant protection aspects and multiple uses of a river and its floodplain (also diverging use interests, conflicts).
In the Danube river basin, the ICPDR85 underlines in the river management plans 2009, 2015 and 2021 the need to improve sediment management and river morphology to address an increasing discrepancy between surplus and lack of sediment, which increases flood risks, reduces navigation possibilities, impacts hydropower production and biodiversity86. The 2021 river management plan recognises the sediment balance alteration as a significant management issue that requires urgent trans-national solutions.
The sediment flows in the Danube river basin were analysed in the ICPDR Danube Sediment Interreg project 87 , which provided Danube Sediment management Guidance 88 , whereas sediment quality monitoring was covered by the ICPDR ?SIMONA? 89 projects. This knowledge and guidance should provide references for the design of effective management measures and their subsequent demonstration at a river basin scale The proposals should focus on the demonstration of sustainable and effective solutions for sediment management at river basin scale, including solutions for restoration of sediment balance and flow in the Danube river-Black sea system and measures to improve sediment quality. The demonstration activities should entail a holistic approach to sediment management, involving all relevant actors at a transnational/national scale and across relevant sectors, such as ICPDR 90 , relevant national authorities, riparian communities as well as concerned economic actors. These demonstration activities should appropriately combine sediment management measures focused on sediment flow quantity such as:
?	measures to restore sediment transport and sediment flows;
?	measures to reduce excessive erosion (e.g. change of sediment regime, increase of bed resistance, reduction of energy slope, nature based solutions, etc.);
?	measures to address excessive sedimentation (e.g. change of sediment regime, route sediments, increase energy slope, increase bed shear stress, etc.),
with measures to improve sediment quality, such as pollution prevention and reduction. The measures should be adjusted to the needs of a specific river section, reservoir or embankment area and ensure a long-term sustainability of sediment flow, also improving the good ecological status and ecosystem services provided by key river ecosystems and habitats, including wetlands and protection of biodiversity. Nature based solutions and building with nature should be prioritised. Use of satellite-based remote sensing is encouraged to complement more traditional approaches on effectiveness assessment of the chosen measures and solutions.
Proposals must:

?	Carry out demonstration activities in 3 different Member States and/or Associated Countries of the Danube river basin, involving and including in the consortium entities from these three countries. These demonstration activities should be selected on the basis of their relevance and impact at the river basin scale and based on the recommendations and results of the previously mentioned projects (ICPDR Danube Sediment Interreg project and SIMONA);
?	Proposals should also identify areas and locations where the proposed solutions are replicable and draw up an action plan and roadmap needed for the replication and scale up of the solutions for sustainable and effective sediment management at a river basin scale.
The projects should include impact monitoring of the activities affecting sediment flow within the Danube river basin and into the Black sea, based on and in cooperation with the ICPDR sediments monitoring system set up through previous projects such as SIMONA and in cooperation with the national water/river management authorities concerned and relevant

European Research Infrastructures. In addition, the project will monitor the impacts and effectiveness of demonstration activities at a local scale.
To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least 5 ?associated regions? to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scalability of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. ?Associated regions? are understood as areas with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities (e.g. neighbouring regions and/or regions in a different sea basin) and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to improve management of sediments in a river basin. The proposals should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. The involvement of ?associated regions? that have not yet participated in Mission projects is encouraged. The partners should proactively reach out to the 'associated regions' to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with those ?associated regions? and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement sustainable, balanced and effective sediment management at a river basin scale in their territory that contribute to achieving the Mission objectives. The technical assistance to the ?associated regions? should include the provision of technical advisory services necessary to the prepare roadmaps, plans and projects to restore sustainable and balanced sediment flow at a river basin scale by addressing possible barriers, improving sediment quality, implementing effective sediment monitoring systems at a river basin scale and showing the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness, in accordance with part G of the general annexes to this work programme. The projects should support data and knowledge sharing through and as well benefit from the Ocean and Water Knowledge System to foster cross- regions, pan-European approaches.
The maximum amount of Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100,000 per ?associated region? for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness.
The proposals are expected to integrate actions to support the social and economic transitions towards sustainable, inclusive and long term management of the restored and protected ecosystems, including natural, social, economic and cultural elements and business models for generating revenue from the restored and protected ecosystems and involve for that purpose local business communities, in particular SMEs, investors and other business stakeholders.
Training and communication activities addressing stakeholders, including regional and local authorities from the ?associated regions? should be included in each proposal. Local actors, including where appropriate, the European Volunteer Corps and Mission Citizen Assemblies, should be involved in the demonstration activities.

The proposal should consider actions to prevent and reduce pollution from different sources (such as chemicals and organic pollutants) affecting sediments with a view to improving their quality.
The proposals should also build on research and innovation developed in the current and previous EU framework programmes, such as but not limited to Horizon2020 and Horizon Europe (notably with projects selected under topics HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-01-02; HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-02 and HORIZON-MISS-2021-OCEAN-02-04) and the
Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda for the Black Sea (SRIA), LIFE, Interreg projects (such as Danube Flood Plain91), and national and regional programmes in the Danube river basin (e.g. Interreg 2021-2027 / EU Macroregional Strategies) as well as the activities of Water4All Partnership and Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership and the Common Maritime Agenda for the Black Sea, in particular in the framework of sustainable sediment management. Additionally, projects should collaborate with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03 to adopt best practices regarding FAIR and open data sharing.
The projects funded under this topic should:

?	build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the lighthouse and its area to maximize synergies, as well as with the European Blue Parks, other Mission lighthouses and their activities;

impacts of other stressors. Activities for quantifying the impact of climate change (acidification, sea-level rise, deoxygenation, ocean warmings, primary production, phytoplankton and zooplankton, etc.) on ocean and coastal ecosystems and biodiversity will be important to understand the stressors. Proposals can include application of genomics methods for the characterization of the biodiversity status, as well as for the long-term biomonitoring of restorative interventions and ecosystem evolution.
Activities will be designed and carried out in partnership with local fishing communities and, where relevant, indigenous people as well as other relevant stakeholders (e.g.: shipping industry) to ensure that the tested solutions grant due consideration to their knowledge, expectations and needs.
Activities will also support evidence-based data and awareness raising on biodiversity conservation in relation to local/regional development and capacity building and will establish good practices for nature-friendly local/regional initiatives and inspire specific transnational cooperation with EU Macro-regional regions.
Citizen engagement is a pillar concept for the Mission. Proposals may involve coastal communities with important biodiversity hotspots, including islands and the EU Outermost Regions in the co-creation of measures that meet the Mission?s aims while granting due consideration to local communities? needs and values. Proposals are expected to involve where appropriate European volunteer/solidarity corps and citizens science activities in the restoration efforts.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-04, European natural lakes:  demonstration of integrated approaches for protection and restoration of natural lake ecosystems and their biodiversity,9/20/2023,IA,1/17/2023,,,Around 4.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhance the implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity Strategy, the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the Water Framework Directive as well as other EU instruments and policies that concern freshwater ecosystems;
?	Improved ecological and chemical status of European natural lakes;
?	Demonstrated integrated and replicable approaches to protection and restoration of natural lake ecosystems, their biodiversity and healthy functioning, integrating all aspects of good ecological and chemical status of lakes under the Water Framework Directive;
?	Demonstrated effective and replicable nature based solutions for restoration and protection of European lakes;
?	Demonstrate improved solutions and systems for effective collaboration between, municipalities, regions and, if relevant, countries within a lake catchment area;
?	Create opportunities for scaling up of solutions for protection and restoration of European lakes through involvement of ?associated regions?.
Scope: Natural lakes are understood for the purposes of this Work Programme as natural inland bodies of standing surface freshwater or brackish water. There are more than 500 000 natural lakes larger than 1ha in Europe98. There were over 2 800 lakes in the EU with bad or poor ecological status and over 8 000 lakes with moderate ecological status in 201899. The main pressures affecting the ecological status of European lakes are hydro-morphological pressures, pollution, in particular from chemicals and nutrient enrichment, water abstraction and climate change impacts. Nutrient enrichment results in algal blooms influencing the ecological status of these waters as well as their use for drinking and recreation.
Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 1 - Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ?development and piloting? phase and 2030 for the ?deployment and upscaling phase?.
The proposals should design and demonstrate integrated and replicable approaches to protect and restore natural lake ecosystems and their biodiversity that result in a significantly improved ecological and chemical status and maintain it in the long-term. The integrated approaches should cover physical and biochemical elements and address in an integrated way all main pressures on the lake ecosystem, (e.g.: water level regulation, water extraction, agriculture, aquaculture and navigation, main source of pollution, barriers to connectivity, pressures on biodiversity, including invasive alien species). Proposals should also consider threats and risks associated to climate change and pressures on biodiversity.
The demonstration activities should combine measures and solutions to reduce pressures and stressors, to restore and protect the lake ecosystem and its biodiversity, in particular using effective nature-based and circular-biobased solutions in the lakes, along shorelines and across their catchments to reduce use of chemicals and retain nutrients. The demonstration sites should be located on natural lakes with a surface area exceeding 1 km2.
Proposals must:

?	Carry out demonstration activities in at least 3 different countries, involving and including in the consortium partners from these three countries;
?	Proposals should also identify areas and locations where the solutions are replicable and draw up an action plan and roadmap to replicate and scale up the solutions and actions for the protection and restoration of natural lakes.
To address the impact-driven approach of the Mission and the nature of Innovation Actions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least 3 ?associated regions? to showcase the feasibility, replicability and scalability of the solutions developed within the projects in other areas. ?Associated regions? are understood as areas with ecosystems that can benefit from the demonstration activities (e.g. in the context of this topic, regions with another natural lake located in EU Member States and/or Associated countries) and/or less-developed regions, with the need to build capacity to implement the innovative solutions to restore freshwater ecosystems. The proposals should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. The involvement of ?associated regions? that have not yet participated in Mission projects is encouraged. The partners will proactively reach out to the associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously

share their outcomes and knowledge with those ?associated regions? and provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement natural lake restoration and protection solutions in their territory to contribute to achieve the Mission objectives. The technical assistance to the ?associated regions? should include advice to the prepare roadmaps, plans and projects to restore and protect natural lakes, to address possible barriers and show the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions.
Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness, in accordance with part G of the general annexes to this work programme.
The projects should support data and knowledge sharing through and as well benefit from the Ocean and Water Knowledge System to foster cross-regions, pan-European approaches. An European Digital Innovation Hub (EDIH) on Natural lakes ? at interregional/transnational level - could be envisaged.
The proposals are expected to integrate actions within basins and across lake catchments that support social and economic transitions towards sustainable, inclusive and long-term management of the restored and protected ecosystems. These should include natural, social, economic and cultural elements and business models for generating revenue from the restored and protected ecosystems. For that purpose, demonstrations should involve local business communities, in particular SMEs, investors and other business stakeholders.
Training, upskilling and communication activities towards stakeholders, including regional and local authorities from the ?associated regions? should be included in each proposal. Local actors, including where appropriate, the European Volunteer Corps and Mission Citizen Assemblies, should be involved in ecosystem restoration and protection activities and any actions for social and economic transitions towards sustainable inclusive and long-term management of the restored ecosystems, using activities like citizen science to encourage involvement and stewardship of lakes and their catchments.
The projects funded under this topic should:

?	build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the Mission lighthouses to maximize synergies, as well as with the European Blue Parks, and other Mission activities;
?	build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the lighthouse support facilities, for reporting in different basins, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area as well as with the Blue Parks technical support platform;
?	support the Ocean and water knowledge system, in particular by contributing to biodiversity monitoring, modelling and knowledge creation and data.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-05, Lighthouse in the Baltic and the North Sea basins - Lighthouse in the Baltic and the North Sea basins - Green and energy efficient small-scale fishing fleets,9/20/2023,IA,1/17/2023,,,Around 4.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhanced implementation of the European Green deal objectives and the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030;
?	Improved understanding of technical, social, legal, regulatory and policy barriers to small-scale fisheries decarbonisation;
?	Reduced fuel consumption and emissions from small-scale fishing vessels and improved energy efficiency in their range of activities, including acoustic noise reduction;
?	Accelerated transition to fleets of small-scale fisheries equipped with greener and energy-efficient technologies to reduce emissions and fuel consumption;
?	Increased users? choices and responsible user behaviours;
?	Improved monitoring and understanding on the impact of greener and more efficient small-scale fishing fleets on the marine environment and marine biodiversity.
Scope: Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 3 ? Sustainable, carbon-neutral and circular blue economy, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ?development and piloting? phase and 2030 for the ?deployment and upscaling phase?.
Proposals will address the complex dynamic of energy consumption and energy efficiency of small-scale fishing vessel fleets and in their range of activities. Under this topic, small-scale

fisheries is defined as ?fishing carried out by fishing vessels of an overall length of less than 12 m and not using towed fishing gear?.
Proposals under this topic are expected to identify a set of suitable innovative and sustainable solutions, technologies, practices and processes to be tested, validated and demonstrated in real conditions to reduce emissions and fuel consumption of small-scale fishing vessels (length of less than 12 m), to increase energy efficiency in their range of activities and comply with EU regulatory frameworks. Solutions should consider multi-disciplinary approaches and guarantee full integration in the vessels. The integrated solutions need to be tested at sea to ensure fitness for purpose in harsh marine environment and for all range of fishing-related activities. Innovative solutions such as battery/hybrid systems, wind-propulsion vessels as well as use of sensors, predictive analytics, data, etc. can be considered.
Impact assessment on the marine environment and its biodiversity should also be carried out as well as an analysis of the obstacles, opportunities and recommendations about good practices for reducing fuel consumption and emissions from small-scale fishing vessels and improving energy efficiency in their range of activities.
Close cooperation between the fishing community, researchers and other stakeholders as well as with environmental organisations, NGOs, national and international authorities is a crucial requirement to ensure that solutions and technologies are suitable for and acceptable by the end-users, economically viable for (often) very small fishing enterprises.
Where appropriate activities may take into account synergies with other actions aimed to reduce waterborne transport emissions, for example projects arising from Horizon Europe calls; HORIZON-CL5-2021-D5-01, HORIZON-CL5-2022-D5-01, HORIZON-CL5-2023-
D5-3, HORIZON-CL5-2024-D5-3 as well as with the activities carried out under the Zero Emission Waterborne Transport Partnership (ZEWT) and the the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership (SBEP). If projects collect in-situ data and marine observations, projects should collaborate with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03 to adopt best practices regarding FAIR and open data sharing.
The projects funded under this topic should:

?	build links with other Mission activities and other relevant activities within the Mission lighthouses to maximize synergies, and with other Mission activities;
?	build links with the Mission implementation monitoring system that will be part of the Mission Implementation Support Platform and with the lighthouse support facilities, for reporting in different basins, monitoring and coordination of all relevant implementation activities in the lighthouse area;

HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-06, Cross-basin topic - Innovative nature-inclusive concepts to reconcile offshore renewables with ocean protection,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 2.25-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:
?	Enhanced implementation of the EU Sustainable Blue Economy Strategy and the achievement of EU Green Deal objectives and the Paris Agreement targets;
?	Development of standards for nature-inclusive design in the offshore renewables sector;
?	New approaches for the design of environmental-friendly offshore platforms;
?	Solutions to meet renewable energy targets and the protection/restoration targets of the EU biodiversity strategy.
Scope: The EU offshore renewable energy strategy sets ambitious objectives for renewable energy production at sea, namely in relation to the RePower Europe Communication107. These objectives are particularly relevant to quickly move away from our dependency on fossil fuels. Deployment of renewable energy solutions needs to be fast and coherent with the EU biodiversity protection and restoration targets. Offshore renewable infrastructures need to be built in such a way that they do not significantly harm the marine environment (e.g.: facilitating the expansion of invasive species) and even, where possible, contribute to restore marine ecosystems. Offshore infrastructures can already have positive impacts on the surrounding biodiversity and act as reefs and refuges for certain species. Nature-inclusive designs might further decrease the negative impacts and enhance desired effects. So far, efforts on design have focused mostly on scour and cable protection in the offshore wind sector. They are limited to few small scale pilot projects and a few species (cod, flat oysters, etc.), that have shown positive impacts on marine ecosystems and concentrate on the seabed close to offshore wind turbines.
Considering the expected expansion of offshore renewables, there is room for the development of innovative concepts to reduce impact of offshore activities and protect the ocean.
Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 3 ? Sustainable, carbon-neutral and circular blue economy, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ?development and piloting? phase and 2030 for the ?deployment and upscaling phase?.
Proposals should focus on truly multidisciplinary approaches for the development of nature- inclusive concept design of offshore renewable energy devices. Proposals should address novel concepts, technologies and solutions beyond the state-of-the-art, taking a life-cycle perspective, thus addressing aspects relating to planning, installation, maintenance and end- of-life issues. Proposals should identify and assess already existing approaches and concepts and highlight the benefits and feasibility of novel solutions.
Nature-inclusive concepts will address the design and choice of materials for the mooring foundations and for the offshore devices, either fixed or floating, noise issues, and laying cables, and show potential positive effects for biodiversity and the marine ecosystems. Multiple-use concepts could also be considered if relevant. Other ocean energy technologies beyond wind energy relying on wave, marine floating photovoltaics and tidal stream, for example, may also be considered.
Recommendations relating to long-term monitoring regimes of the impacts are also expected. Proposals should include biodiversity and ecosystem impact and risk assessments, (also in relation to risks of propagating invasive species).
The activities are also expected to contribute to the development of environmental standards in the field and of good practices for decision-making, planning processes and future

HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-07, Cross-basin topic - Analysis of the obstacles and opportunities for repurposing aged/unused offshore infrastructures,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 1.40-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Solutions to support marine restoration ?	Insights in view of sustainable business models;
?	Options for repurposing aged/unused offshore platforms and enhance the circular economy transition.
Scope: The increasing number of offshore infrastructures to be decommissioned in the near future in the European seas requires a sound assessment of environmental, social and technical impacts that decommissioning processes carry. Alternatives to decommissioning can be viewed as an opportunity to preserve the marine habitats around these platforms and to convert these infrastructures to other potentially valuable uses with environmental, economic and/or scientific benefits.
Proposals under this topic are expected to show how their activities and results will achieve the Mission objective 3 ? Sustainable, carbon-neutral and circular blue economy, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the ?development and piloting? phase and 2030 for the ?deployment and upscaling phase?.
Decisions taken in the coming years will determine whether offshore infrastructures become an environmental liability or an opportunity for preserving marine ecosystems, minimising risks and promoting innovation.
There are several options available to dispose of offshore infrastructures, including complete removal and re-processing of the materials, partial removal or dismantling the structure and placing the materials on the seabed, reuse and re-purposing of the infrastructure for e.g. scientific and ocean monitoring purposes, economic, or recreational activities.
Proposals under this topic should focus on analysing options to decommissioning offshore platforms, in light of marine conservation and ecosystem protection, identifying possible business models and assessing related implications for policy/decision making and for public acceptance. This analysis should complement the outcomes of the Study on ?Decommissioning of offshore oil and gas installations: a technical, legal and political analysis109? and will address all following issues:
Proposals should address all following issues:

1.	Carry out a review of existing experiences, strategies and programmes for alternatives to offshore platforms decommissioning;
2.	Design a framework for cost-benefit analysis of potential options to decommissioning of offshore platforms, including a risk/benefit analysis of these potential options on marine ecosystems and biodiversity;
3.	Examine related legal, regulatory and policy issues; 4.	Carry out informed discussions among major stakeholders, environmental organisations and NGOs, owners and operators, national and regional public authorities (including Regional Sea Conventions) and agencies for defining actions to address obstacles and opportunities for repurposing aged/unused offshore platforms and identify at least 3 promising sites for future demonstration activities;
5.	Assess the socio-economic benefits including job creation of decommissioning versus repurposing.",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-01-08, Integration of socio-ecological models into the Digital Twin Ocean,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 3.30-3," Expected Outcome: Expected outcomes should complement the capacities and uses of the European Digital Twin Ocean (EU DTO) by:
?	Solutions to the challenges of marine social-ecological modelling in a manner that will allow for their seamless incorporation in the framework of the Digital Twin Ocean, taking into consideration their complex nature. Marine social-ecological models aim to integrate modelling approaches originating from different disciplines, focusing on different levels of analysis and implementing different methodological frameworks in a meaningful way. The challenges include interoperability of transdisciplinary data (ecological, social, economic, legal, etc.); integration of models with different spatial and temporal resolutions, calculation of uncertainties and more.
?	Social-ecological models, developed with a multi-actor approach, that would help assess the impacts of environmental changes, human pressures and/or policy implementation on the overall ocean health, blue economy and societal prosperity;
?	Improved understanding of complex social-ecological systems, aiming in better management of human activities, responding to societal needs (local communities, economic activities, growing resources needs, ?), avoiding negative outcomes of policies such as the loss of jobs, overfishing, hypoxia, or stock collapse.
Scope: The vision for the European Digital Twin Ocean is to make ocean knowledge readily available to citizens, entrepreneurs, scientists and policy-makers and to provide them with an innovative set of user-driven and interactive tools, fostered by digital transition, empowering them to collectively share the responsibility of marine and coastal habitats and act on their restoration, to support a sustainable blue economy and to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It aims to provide consistent high-resolution, multi-dimensional description of the ocean: its physical, chemical, biological and social-ecological and economical dimensions, with forecasting periods from season to multi-decades, transforming data into knowledge. This call aims to support the necessary actions and tool developments to appropriately include the social-ecological component of the European Digital Twin Ocean, including the links and interactions with other parts of the system (data, underlying models, ecosystem models, local twins, etc.), the necessary social-economic data considerations and the development of models and other applications to simulate the social and economic part of marine and coastal systems linked to the environmental/ecological components, enabling the development of normative (what-if scenarios) and decision-support tools.

Proposals should address all activities and tasks as described below, in cooperation and complementarity with the linked actions and other relevant actions:
?	Address the long-term and reliable accessibility and availability of spatially explicit social and economic data, fit-for-purpose for the development of social-ecological models and other relevant approaches as described below. The social and economic data should be integrated with the available marine data sources and models of the DTO in an interoperable and standardised manner. This should include considerations related to spatial and temporal scale of analysis and data collection, development of methodological protocols to connect socio-economic data with environmental data, etc.
?	Development of a wide range of social-ecological models, tools and applications, from simple impact assessment models, to agent-based models, to integrated social-ecological models, with capacity to run and assess a variety of normative (what-if) scenarios, evaluating the impact and long-term effect of environmental change, policy alternatives and management decisions to coastal and marine systems, both environmentally and societally.
?	Assessment of existing or development of new parallel frameworks of analysis, other than models to be integrated into the framework of the DTO. As not all aspects of socio- economic systems and behaviours can be assessed through numerical models, other methodologies should be investigated and developed, to ensure inclusion of these parts of the system into the DTO and link them appropriately with the social-ecological models.
?	Development of integrated ecological and socio-economic indicators that can be used in the assessment of the impacts of environmental, policy or management change in coastal and marine social-ecological systems.
?	Development of new processes and tools for decision-support, participatory management and policy scenarios assessment, including the methodological approaches to effective stakeholders? engagement.
Proposals should address considerations of social-ecological modelling in the overall framework of the European Digital Twin Ocean, but also develop applications appropriate for use in local Twins.
Proposals should support the Mission?s Blue Parks and Mission lighthouses and efficient ocean stewardship. Projects should collaborate with projects funded under the topic HORIZON-INFRA-2022-EOSC-01-03 to adopt best practices regarding FAIR and open data sharing.",

These activities should also increase awareness on the benefits to the planet from consuming sustainable seafood products (including under organic farming) as well as in relation to the lower relative carbon footprint of aquatic food.
Activities should have a broad geographical coverage in all Member States and Associated Countries. To take in due account local/regional specificities, activities should be co-designed

and co-implemented with seafood retailers, consumer associations, producers and SMEs to motivate them to support informed choices of consumers.
Links with the ?Taste the Ocean? initiative as well as with other international, national or local initiatives are encouraged in order to maximise the impact on more sustainable seafood and aquaculture products choices",

Mission)",4/27/2023,IA,1/10/2023,,,Around 25.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Mobility solutions that respond to people?s and cities? needs, co-designed with local authorities, citizens and stakeholders, tested and implemented in cities to achieve climate neutrality by 2030.
?	Transferrable solutions for mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of electrification, automation and connectivity to significantly and measurably contribute to:
o	The Cities Mission?s objective of climate neutrality by 2030;
o	Reduction of CO2 emissions supporting the 55% reduction goal for 2030;
o	Lower energy demand;
o	Improved air quality, less noise;
o	Reduced congestion, more reliable, predictive travel times and more efficient transport operations;
o	More effective use of urban space also considering the other transport modes and multimodal hubs;
o	Improved safety particularly for vulnerable road users;
o	Improved inclusiveness, especially by facilitating equitable and affordable access to mobility for all users, in particular for people with reduced mobility ?	Economically viable, modular and adaptable solutions that are transferrable among cities committed to achieving climate neutrality by 2030.
?	Capacity built among local authorities, users and mobility systems providers to accelerate the take-up of shared, smart and zero emission solutions and to implement their monitoring and evaluation.
?	Implementation plans for local and regional transport authorities to replicate the roll-out of innovative smart mobility solutions and related infrastructure (in particular for charging and/or connectivity) in cities beyond those involved in the project.
?	Contribution to updates of urban and transport policies as well as relevant strategic research and innovation agendas (SRIA), particularly of the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships.
Scope: Urban mobility is a key sector that cities need to address for accelerating their transition to climate neutrality: citizens, freight forwarders, urban planners, transport operators as well as technology providers should jointly exploit the combined potentials of electric, automated and connected vehicles as well as integrated and shared people mobility and freight transport in their planning and actions. This requires a mutual understanding and alignment of the opportunities of technical solutions from the CCAM and 2Zero partnerships and of needs identified by users and cities striving for the Mission target of climate neutrality.
Proposals should include co-designed innovative passenger mobility and freight transport concepts which are agreed between technology providers and cities, in cooperation with end users, citizens and other stakeholders (for example visitors) to optimise the performance, ease of use and to maximise uptake. They should then be tested and demonstrated in real environments and use cases before being replicated. They should complement current public transport and freight transport services as well as active mobility and micromobility, also with modular and interoperable last mile choices, while being scalable for the roll out, adaptability and co-implementation for different types of cities. At the same time, they should help to identify new challenges, e.g. regarding flexibility, privacy and resilience, in order to set requirements for the further improvement of technologies.
Proposals are expected to develop, test and demonstrate innovative solutions for mobility of people and freight exploiting the combined potential of electrification, automation and connectivity. Proposals must consider and explore the opportunities for technology transfer and synergy potentials with the respective other domain to fully cover passenger and goods mobility, although a primary focus on either people or goods mobility is possible. Solutions should be based on existing technologies and should satisfy cities? and users? needs, targeting implementation of pilot cases at city level to ensure feasibility, buy-in, acceptance and thus a seamless integration of mobility solutions and infrastructure in a citywide transport system.
All the following aspects should be addressed by the proposals:

?	Establish a co-design process between local public authorities, city planners, end users (for example inhabitants, visitors, commuters) and automated and zero-emission mobility systems providers to ensure a user-centric and seamless integration of solutions in existing ecosystems.
?	Build upon the results of recent collaborative research on, for example, power grid integration, charging infrastructure, vehicle connectivity, automation or smart fleet, road traffic and energy management, safety of vulnerable road users, and also build upon relevant experience of cities and partnerships.
?	Demonstrate integrated and shared, automated and zero-emission solutions and services for people mobility and freight transport. Where needed and duly justified, design of vehicles and functions and the development of specific infrastructures for energy and joint and harmonized data management 120 to extend and optimise their use can be included.
?	Develop open while resilient systems and replicable solutions that can be scaled-up within a city environment and flexibly adapted to current and evolving needs and use cases in the context of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP). Mobility services to and from sub-urban areas should be included in proposed solutions, so as to widen the pool of possible users of these solutions, services and systems.
?	Co-design implementation plans for local and regional transport authorities to roll-out innovative smart mobility solutions and related infrastructure (in particular for charging and connectivity) and to lower energy demand.
?	Evaluate cost and benefits of the systems and services tested along with real-world challenges and opportunities, based on user and city needs, and provide feedback on viability and limitations as well as new requirements to the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships.
?	Support the development of skills on the planning and implementation of smart, shared and zero-emission urban mobility systems within the local authorities and co-creation with private stakeholders along SUMP and SULP (Sustainable Urban Logistics Planning) guidelines, e.g. the practitioner briefing on Road Vehicle Automation of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans.
?	Disseminate results via the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships and the Mission Platform and via relevant events, such as CIVITAS, Transport Research Arena (TRA) conference and other European events.
Proposals should fully exploit technologies developed/under development in the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships when designing, testing and demonstrating solutions and services, such as, e.g., automated and connected functions or digital twins optimising the charging, parking safe (remote) control, operational design domain of vehicles or the fleet, traffic management and last-mile operations.
To allow for a thorough evaluation of the projects? ambition, progress and effect compared to the state of the art in the European Union and internationally, proposals are expected to provide measurable or predictable indicators of contributions of the tested solutions to the applicable outcomes and impacts expected from the 2Zero and CCAM partnerships as well as the Cities Mission. These should be supported by clear baselines, quantified targets and appropriate review processes for each participating city and include a detailed analysis of present and future potential user groups. The ?CIVITAS Process and Impact Evaluation Framework? and ?Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators?, where appropriate in combination with other sector-specific impact evaluation methodologies, should be used to evaluate the impact of the solutions.
Selected projects may consider including activities to investigate and foster societal readiness, for example by measuring the acceptability of new mobility solutions as well as behavioural change. This could include inter alia methods of co-assessment as well as actions to increase public awareness in order to anticipate and mitigate potential negative rebound effects.
This should be accompanied by mechanisms for common lesson drawing and learning, within the project, between the projects funded under this topic and through the Cities Mission Platform and 2Zero/CCAM partnerships.
Each proposal should envisage pilot demonstrations in at least two cities (lead cities) situated each in a different Member State or Associated Country. Proposals should provide the necessary evidence of the cities? commitment to test and implement the co-designed solutions. To foster replicability and up-taking of the outcomes, each proposal should also engage at least four replication/follower cities.
The consortia awarded under this topic must establish a collaboration agreement, to identify clear links among themselves and ensure complementarity, coordination and exchange on relevant linked activities. The consortia awarded should also foresee active collaboration with relevant and related projects funded under this call in order to address synergies and complementarities between the projects of the Cities Mission portfolio. In particular collaboration with the Mission Platform is essential. The collaboration between consortia awarded as well as with the Mission Platform must be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the projects' starting date.
In addition, given the important role of territories in which the participating cities are located, lead cities are encouraged to seek cooperation with and support from their territories, where relevant (metropolis, functional urban area, grouping of interacting municipalities with the cities, region, etc.). Support could take the form of, for example, an integration or link in an existing or future programme of the territory, financial support, or the involvement of representatives of these territories as partners in the project.

This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.?Social innovation should also be considered to support the actions under this topic in order to match innovative ideas with social needs.?Inclusiveness of vulnerable populations (older people, children) as well as gender perspectives in mobility should be considered.
If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries are expected to clearly describe if and how the use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS are incorporated in the proposed solutions. In addition, if the activities proposed involve the use and/or development of AI-based systems and/or techniques, the technical and social robustness of the proposed systems has to be described in the proposal",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-CIT-01-02, Positive clean energy district (PED) digital twins ? from modelling to creating climate neutral Cities,4/27/2023,IA,1/10/2023,,,6.00 to 7.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes:
?	Increased number of (tangible) city planning actions for positive clean energy districts using the (proto-)PED design, development and management digital twin tools (based on pre-market research learnings) using open-standards based components which can be reused elsewhere.
?	Enhanced data gathering approaches with identification relevant (standardised) multi- dimensional data set (e.g. meteorological, load profile, social, geo-spatial, etc.) high- resolution real-time data streams (e.g. renewable energy production, energy consumption), and relevant forecasting data, drawing also on the work of common European data spaces, including the smart communities data space.
?	Consolidated city sensor network specifications (based on optimal density necessary), complemented by appropriate data gathering approaches for soft data.
?	Increased integration of existing smaller scale management systems (e.g. Building management systems) with open-standards based operational city platforms using sectorial data (e.g. Building data, mobility, Urban Planning, etc.).
?	Increased number of city planning departments / approaches using common data and (replicable) elements and processes.
?	Improved performance of AI based self-learning systems for optimization of positive clean energy districts and bottom-up complex models.
Scope: Effective support for the Cities Mission should follow a systematic approach appropriate to the highly complex task of delivering climate neutral and smart cities. In order to be manageable, this task should be approached starting from the smallest representative scale, i.e. the District level. Measuring, analysing and modelling the characteristics and behaviour of a potential Positive clean Energy District (PED) is necessary to get the best possible picture of the status quo and the extent of the challenge. Creating a digital twin can support identification of the most effective set of integrated solutions and the management of the system in real time in order to adapt/optimise it over time and space.
Proposed projects are expected to go beyond the creation of a digital twin and the integration of (technical) PED solutions. The proposed projects will serve as the scientific base for a reflection on the necessary, replicable elements and processes that are needed to make first a district, and later on the whole city, climate neutral.
Proposals are expected to develop a digital twin that goes beyond the virtual representation of the built environment, by integrating a comprehensive modelling layer of the local energy systems 122 as well as mobility and transport solutions in the project defined district boundaries. The digital twin should support scenario analysis with different boundary conditions to help define the optimal solution matrix. It should draw on existing components and use open standards, technical specifications and open source software where possible.
Projects are expected to address all of the following:

?	Develop and test a digital twin of a (project defined) potential Positive clean Energy District (PED) in a European city.
?	Prepare an economic impact study for this digital PED twin, a risk analysis and a data security strategy.
?	Use the digital twin to improve evidence-based decision-making and to create district development pathways with a clear timeline for associated transformation actions.
?	Involve/train necessary public and private actors at district/city level in building and using digital twins for co-creation, communication, public consultation/dialogues and good practice sharing.
?	Make use of gamification and/or co-creation approaches123 to change citizens? awareness of and behaviour towards energy efficient/energy conservation and to make results of the digital twin analysis easily understandable to non-technical audiences.
?	Recommend a set of actions that foster a cost effective and secure digitalization of the local energy system.
?	Publish practical guidelines, reusable models, algorithms, data models, components and training material that will help other cities to successfully replicate digital twins in their district/cities. Projects should establish links to the data space for smart communities and sectoral data spaces124 as relevant (energy, mobility) as well as working with the Data Space Support Centre125. Projects should collaborate with Living-in.EU to support efforts on developing the Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIMs) approach to improving interoperability of data, systems and services, and to contribute to standardisation efforts in the area of local digital twins at European and international levels. Participation of partners and potential Positive Energy Districts is encouraged, in particular from Mission Innovation (MI) member countries126 and linking to the objectives of the MI Urban Transitions Mission127.
Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential and projects should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work plan of the proposal. The collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform should be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the projects starting date",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-CIT-02-01, Associating Ukrainian cities to the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission,9/6/2023,CSA,4/4/2023,,,Around 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Contribute to the implementation of EU policy and international commitments (European Green Deal132, Global Approach to Research and Innovation133).
?	Identify a core group of Ukrainian cities that would commit to a climate neutrality target, including in reconstruction efforts;
?	Accelerate the systemic transition to climate-neutrality of Ukrainian cities by preparing local authorities to meet the overarching objectives of the European Green Deal;
?	Increase the visibility of the EU and its cities as leaders and engage cities participating in the Cities Mission in twinning and teaming activities with collaboration-minded Ukrainian city partners.
Scope: President von der Leyen?s statement on 27 April 2022 134 and the subsequent Commission Communication on Ukraine Relief and Reconstruction 135 of 18 May 2022 propose to involve, through partnerships, the cities of the European Union in the reconstruction of the Ukrainian cities. This effort provides a unique opportunity for Ukraine and its cities to combine reconstruction considerations with long-term climate neutrality and sustainability objectives in line with the EU Green Deal, relevant international policy frameworks and the New European Bauhaus initiative. This will require systemic approaches and the deployment of innovative solutions to reduce in particular Green House Gas emissions in all sectors of activities so as to comply with the objective of climate neutrality. The purpose of this action is to associate more closely Ukrainian cities in the process of transition towards climate neutrality that is being promoted by the Horizon Europe Climate- neutral and smart cities Mission . Proposals are expected to address all the following activities:
?	Map, on the basis of existing EU and international initiatives136, the cities in Ukraine that could commit to the target of climate neutrality. The analysis that will be performed will be based on the methodological approach and guidelines published in the call for Expression of Interest of 25 November 2021137;
?	Following this analysis, identify and support a number of Ukrainian cities in developing their strategy for climate neutrality. Support should be provided to increase the awareness and the capacity of the local authorities on the issues related to climate neutrality. When developing their strategy for climate neutrality, cities should pay special attention to the need to reduce energy dependency from fossil fuels, to integrate climate neutrality considerations in their reconstruction plans and, when applicable, a citizen-driven systemic approach;
?	Support the twinning and teaming between these Ukrainian cities and like-minded cities involved in the EU Cities Mission138;
?	Facilitate the exchange of good practices within the target group of Ukrainian cities and between them and the other cities in Ukraine.
The proposals will take into account the work already done by global city networks such as the Global Covenant of Mayors, C40 Cities and the EU?s International Urban and Regional Cooperation Programme, by international and multilateral organisations such as the UN- Habitat, the World Economic Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, by international associations such as ICLEI and by global initiatives such as the Urban Transition Mission of Mission Innovation. Linkages should also be ensured with international networks that promote piloting activities such as the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) and with the initiatives for urban climate neutrality under the EU?s Neighborhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument.
Close collaboration with the Mission Platform presently managed by the NetZeroCities project139 is essential and projects should ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the workplan. Detailed description of the specific activities and common actions that will be undertaken is not required at proposal stage and can be further defined at a second stage during the lifetime of the projects. The collaboration with the Mission Platform should be formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date.
Collaboration with programmes and initiatives managed by the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should also be considered when helping cities identify sources of funding for the implementation of their climate-neutral strategy.
Cooperation with the Global Covenant of Mayors 140 as well as with the European Alliance of Cities and Regions for Ukraine, which is being proposed by the European Committee of the Regions141 for the reconstruction of Ukraine should also be taken into account in order to facilitate the peer to peer cooperation between cities and regions in the European Union and those in Ukraine",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-01, Discovering the subsoil,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 6.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Activities under this topic will help to progress towards the objectives of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?165, in particular to its specific objective 2 ?Conserve and increase soil organic carbon stocks? and 6 ?Improve soil structure to enhance habitat quality for soil biota and crops?. Activities should also contribute to the EU Soil Strategy166 and to the Long-term vision for EU?s rural areas167, as the Mission is one of its flagship initiatives.
Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Improved access to data and knowledge on the spatial variations of the chemical, physical and biological conditions and dynamics in subsoils for land managers and public authorities to support the development of sustainable soil management practices as well as financial and policy incentives ?	Enhanced deployment of sustainable management practices for protecting and restoring subsoils in agricultural, forest and other types of soils, and increasing relevant soil- dependent ecosystem services such as the provision of food and fibre or habitats for soil biodiversity.
?	Improved understanding of the role of the subsoil in climate change adaptation and mitigation, e.g. regarding carbon and water storage.
Scope: The term ?subsoil? refers to the horizons immediately below the topsoil168. In the past, this layer has often been neglected as most land management practices (e.g. tillage, cover crops, forestry) are focused on the topsoil. Our understanding of subsoil issues (e.g. compaction and its persistence) in semi-natural environments (e.g. heathlands, peatlands, natural grassland) is even less developed than for agricultural and forestry subsoils. Spatial datasets on soils at both national and EU-scale have also mostly focused on topsoil.
The subsoil can have a large impact on a soil's potential productivity and supply of ecosystem services. It is estimated, for example, that plants extract between 10 and 80% of their nutrient and water requirements from the subsoil. Carbon sequestered in subsoils generally contributes to more than half of the total stocks within a soil profile. In contrast to topsoil, organic matter stored in subsoil horizons is characterised by high mean residence times169.
Conversely, subsoil degradation (e.g. through compaction, pollution, salinization) may limit root penetration, reduce nutrient uptake and result in plants becoming increasingly susceptible to stress such as from pests and diseases or drought and floods. Reduced water infiltration in subsoils limits plant growth, while increasing surface water runoff and the risk of soil erosion. Timber-related activities in forests, for example, can also cause considerable soil compaction leading to a decrease in productivity of forests due to increased surface water runoff and erosion.
Activities under this topic should improve our understanding and knowledge of the links between the subsoil and ecosystem services, and they should promote practices that enhance the health status of subsoils in agriculture, forestry and urban areas, as well as sites of nature conservation and sensitive landscapes.
Proposed activities should:

?	Increase knowledge of properties (e.g. soil structure) and chemical, physical and biological process dynamics and their relationships in subsoils, and how these contribute to the delivery of ecosystem services (such as carbon storage and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, water retention, nutrient provision, crop productivity, and habitat for soil biodiversity) and overall soil health ?	Identify pressures on the subsoil that impair a range of soil functions and ecosystem services, as well as drivers for subsoil degradation, and identify indicators to assess subsoil driven changes in soil ecosystem functioning.
?	Develop tools and methods for risk assessment as regards subsoil degradation, reflecting diverse soil uses. Demonstrate practical approaches for the use of these tools and methods by land managers and policy-decision makers.
?	Identify the potential of subsoils to store and maintain carbon, and to contribute to mitigating other GHG (e.g. N2O) emissions. Work should take into account potential barriers and the synergies and trade-offs between climate regulation and other ecosystem services, such as the support to biodiversity. Consideration should be given to existing and future land use options.
?	Identify existing as well as develop and test, in cooperation with land managers, sustainable management practices to improve subsoil health and therefore its functions (e.g. water retention, nutrient provision, habitat for soil biodiversity, carbon storage).
?	Establish robust methods to spatially assess and monitor the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of subsoils and, to improve data collection and use. For this, sampling methods for subsoil should be harmonised in order to provide comparable and reliable data. The long-term storage and access to subsoil data should be done in close collaboration with the European Soil Observatory (EUSO).
In carrying out activities, proposals should consider various soil types and land uses and climatic/biogeographical regions in the EU and Associated Countries. With regard to agriculture, work should draw on sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and for the benefit of both conventional and organic farming. The proposals selected under this topic should dedicate the necessary resources to work closely together to maximise synergies.
Activities should be undertaken in close cooperation with the European Commission?s Joint Research Centre (JRC). The cooperation with the JRC is particularly relevant in view of further developing the LUCAS Soil survey and the Soil Health Dashboard under the European Soil Observatory (EUSO). Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the EUSO and other projects to be funded under the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?. Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this call or future calls of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-02, Soil pollution processes ? modelling and inclusion in advanced digital decision-support tools,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 7.00-2,"Expected Outcome: Activities under this topic will help to progress towards the objectives of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?, in particular, to its first operational objective of building the knowledge base for soil health and its support to ecosystems services, by closing gaps in the existing R&I programme.
Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Increased understanding of the impact of various types of soil pollution on soil-related processes, soil functions and related ecosystem services along with increased insight into soil responses to different land-use and soil-management practices, restoration mechanisms, emission controls, climate extremes, drying-rewetting cycles and land cover dynamics at various scales.
?	Enhanced access to soil relevant knowledge and data for a wide range of stakeholders that can inform practices and policies for sustainable soil management.
?	Enhanced capacities are in place to integrate diverse data streams (including from Earth Observation), to model and predict soil-related processes and their interactions with soil pollutants, and ultimately to demonstrate that policy measures (for air, water, soils) can over time have a positive impact on soils.

?	Data and tools available can feed effectively and further advance the ?Destination Earth? initiative170.
Scope: Depending on the scale, severity and type of contamination, pollutants can have a detrimental effect on soils by altering underlying chemical, physical and biological processes. Examples of common soil pollutants include heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, pesticides, microplastics and emerging pollutants like pharmaceutical and personal care products. In agriculture, soil pollution has severe consequences with regard to food safety.
The capacity to carry out a comprehensive scenario analysis at EU level on the impact of key drivers on soil pollution (e.g. societal behaviour, changes in emissions, climate, land management practices) is currently lacking. Soil-oriented fate and transport models exist for certain pollutants (e.g. pesticides, radionuclides, nutrients, metals) but they are generally not integrated with each other, often lack a temporal capacity, and do not always provide a quantification of actual risk to human and environmental health. Models that address the extent, fate, and transport, of emerging contaminants (e.g. microplastics, pharmaceuticals, PFAS) are even scarcer.
In addition, environmental pollution modelling is also often compartmentalized despite a clear understanding that soil can be both a recipient of atmospheric deposition (e.g. nitrogen and sulphur) and a source of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gases (e.g. N2O, NH4, CO2, dust, nutrients). While also acting as a buffer to water bodies from pollutants, soils can be at the origin of some of the main problems affecting terrestrial ecosystems, freshwater and marine ecosystems (e.g. nitrification, eutrophication, pesticides, in both water column and sediment) as well as compromise the production of safe food and human health. Currently, there is no integrated modelling system that seamlessly links all three environmental compartments (soil, air, water). In addition there is a clear need to demonstrate that policy measures that affect air quality or industrial emissions can, over time, have a positive impact also on soils and water bodies.
Proposed activities should:

?	Integrate and improve existing models and develop and test new models of soil processes that allow for better and easier integration of and reduced uncertainty about soil-related (physical, chemical and biological) processes, with a particular focus on different forms of pollution and with a view to its prevention and reduction.
?	Integrate soil processes modelling for quantification of soil ecosystem services with assessments of threats from diverse pollution sources.
?	Ensure inter-operability between existing databases and integration into Destination Earth and the EU Soil Observatory.
?	Develop specific use cases for soil modelling towards the integration of local sustainable soil management practices or catchment or field scale modelling ? for example, the role of water and wind erosion in the movement of pollutants, nutrient flows in the context of circular economy, interactions between surface-subsurface-groundwater-air components), and links with the objectives of the Oceans and Climate Missions.
?	Develop scenarios based on integrated models that allow to show a) how changes in land management practices can reduce soil pollution (and in consequence air and water pollution) and b) the effects of policies on land management practices that avoid/reduce soil pollution.
Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and project outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre and its EU Soil Observatory171 and take into account other relevant projects funded under the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? (e.g. projects funded under the topic HORIZON-MISS-2022-SOIL-01-04: Remediation strategies, methods and financial models for decontamination and reuse of land in urban and rural areas and HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-01: Discovering the subsoil) and Destination Earth.
The proposals selected under this topic should dedicate the necessary resources to work closely together to maximise synergies and minimise overlaps. Furthermore, coordination with the successful proposals under topic HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-0201: ?Prevention, detection, response and mitigation of chemical, biological and radiological threats to agricultural production, forestry and to food processing, distribution and consumption? should be envisaged to avoid duplication, and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. To this end proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and allocate appropriate resources.

Increased scale-up, availability and use of onsite digital tools (e.g., light-based technologies, remote sensing, Artificial Intelligence (AI)) to monitor nutrients, micro- nutrients, chemical and biological stressors in soil, plants and subsequently in food in various stages of the production process (from farm to processing stages).
?	Improved capacities for food safety risk mitigation and management throughout the various food production stages.
Scope: Onsite digital technologies and applications are emerging in food production and have the potential to detect chemical and biological stressors in soil and plants to help assessing, managing and eventually eliminating potential food safety risks that these stressors may pose. There is a need to improve the development and application of digital tools in primary production and food industries and boost their technological scale-up as a means to address more effectively the soil-food nexus. Moreover, those technologies will help the food industry to track safety and quality of post-harvested food grown in soils.
Proposed activities should:

?	Advance and/or develop onsite digital technologies and applications (e.g., light-based technologies, remote sensing, AI) to analyse (detect and quantify) nutrients that could support appropriate interventions at the various food production stages (from farm to processing stages) to enrich soil or remove excess nutrients and micronutrients.
?	Advance and/or develop onsite digital technologies and applications (e.g., light-based technologies, remote sensing, AI) to analyse (detect and quantify) chemical (contaminants, anti-nutrients, pollutants) and biological contaminants (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) in soil, plants and food with the aim to mitigate/manage the potential of food safety risks associated with their presence.
?	Advance and/or develop digital technologies and applications for in-field detection of soil parameters with relevance for food safety and nutrition to improve soil management practices (e.g., targeted fertilization, soil remediation).
?	Advance and/or develop innovative digital technologies including exploratory modelling for calibration and prediction, to detect nutrients and micronutrients, chemical and biological contaminants which have a bearing on food quality and safety.
?	Identify challenges to the scale-up of existing digital technologies related to the soil-food nexus.

Proposals should also include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, and ensure as well synergies with projects funded under topics HORIZON-MISS-2021-SOIL-02-03: ?Linking soil health to nutritional and safe food?, and HORIZON-CL6-2023-GOVERNANCE: ?Digital technologies supporting plant health early detection, territory surveillance and phytosanitary measures?.

Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	The socio-economic and climatic drivers, the extent and the impacts of different types of land degradation (incl. water scarcity, vegetation loss, soil erosion) in (semi-)natural and agricultural systems of arid areas and areas becoming increasingly arid are clearly understood, accurately and reliably measured at the most relevant scale and in

connection with specific land uses, and the knowledge is widely shared among relevant actors from various sectors.
?	The economic viability and environmental effectiveness of solutions for the prevention of desertification and for the restoration of degraded land (such as soil protection measures that help retain water and reduce water needs, improve management of soil organic matter, avoid salinization, protect biodiversity and increase land resilience to droughts) is firmly established in the different local or regional contexts.
?	Enhanced access for land managers in desertification-prone areas to effective, context- specific restoration and prevention solutions and to information about the conditions under which they are effective.
?	Dryland soils become more resilient and less vulnerable to drought and desertification. The number and size of areas under sustainable soil and water management are expanded, and the retention of moisture in the landscape and the management of soil organic matter are improved across different land-use types and local-regional conditions.
Scope: In 2017, 25% of land in Southern, Central and Eastern Europe was estimated to be at high or very high risk of desertification172. The risk is likely to have further increased since then, and to continue increasing, as a consequence of accelerating climate change and continued pressures from land use and land-use change, both in the European Union and beyond. Desertification leads to loss of biodiversity, of organic carbon and of other land- based ecosystem services, including reduced agricultural and forest productivity. Desertification further amplifies global warming through the release of CO2 and other greenhouse gases linked with the decrease in vegetation cover. Thus it has severe environmental, social and economic consequences.
Proposed activities should:

?	Synthesise and gather evidence on the drivers and impacts of land degradation at all relevant scales, using diverse data flows and where relevant models, with a view to supporting alternative land management actions (scenarios) to alleviate the pressures from land uses and land-use changes leading to desertification.
?	Demonstrate the effectiveness and promote the scale-up of measures for reducing and reversing desertification and increasing soil water-retention capacity, taking into account (actual and projected) change in climatic conditions and different scales of actions as well as various land uses and land use changes ?	Specifically for agricultural land, with regard to both conventional and organic farming, identify and demonstrate farming or other land-use practices which are more resilient and are suitable for combatting desertification while sustaining ecosystem services and preventing land abandonment.
?	Facilitate cross-sectoral learning and exchange among all relevant actors by including various types of innovations (nature-based, technological, socio-economic, cultural and institutional) and/or various types of land use (natural and semi-natural as well as agricultural, agroforestry and forest areas).
?	Develop options for creating incentives and overcoming obstacles for the widespread uptake of desertification prevention and restoration measures demonstrated to be effective and suitable for scaling-up.
Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre?s EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and with other projects to be funded under the Soil Mission. Proposals should also include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic, and ensure synergies with projects funded as part of the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA)173 and with the EU LIFE project NewLIFE4-Drylands174.

Activities should also contribute to EU climate action and to other policies in the framework of the European Green Deal, such as the Organic Action Plan175, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030176 and the proposed Nature Restoration Law177.
Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Reduced carbon and overall environmental footprint of the horticultural sector178 and more sustainable production systems, reducing negative impacts on soil health throughout the value chain.
?	Novel products (e.g. alternative potting and soil-improving materials), production processes and management options for soil management are developed and tested and show improved environmental, social, health and safety performance, as demonstrated through improved testing and validation methods throughout the entire life cycle.
?	Sustainable alternatives to peat are more widely available and used in conventional and organic horticulture.
?	Policy measures have been explored and elaborated to further the uptake of sustainable alternatives to peat.
Scope: Practices in horticulture can impact soil health and related ecosystem services at different points in the value chain, for example at production sites as well as further upstream. Within horticultural production systems, soils are often subjected to particularly intensive use, which can cause among others soil compaction, soil pollution (e.g. excess nutrients or microplastics), and salinization, as a consequence of intensive irrigation. Peat is commonly used in nurseries, greenhouses and amateur horticulture as a growing medium and for soil improvement, as it has an excellent water retention capacity, is highly fertile due to the reduced leaching of nutrients and can improve soil buffering capacity. The extraction of natural peat is highly contentious as the disturbance of peatlands leads to habitat loss, soil degradation, CO2 emissions and increased flood risks. Therefore, sustainable alternatives to natural peat are required. While various peat-free or peat-reduced growing media have become more widely available in recent years, their performance with regard to environmental and other relevant criteria remains difficult to assess.
Proposed activities should:

?	Identify, develop and promote horticultural production systems and establish cropping practices that conserve or improve soil health, including alternative materials to be used as sustainable substitute for peat to use as substrate or soil improver in organic and conventional horticulture, with the aim of attenuating soil stress and strengthening ecosystem services.
?	Further develop sustainable management practices (including digital technologies and infrastructures) to reduce the use of plant protection products, fertilizers and water in horticultural crops and improve soil structure in order to mitigate soil compaction. Where applicable, practices should cover both protected (greenhouses and tunnels) and open field systems.
?	Demonstrate the feasibility and economic viability of the newly developed alternatives to production and use of peat in horticulture. This should be done in accordance with relevant EU regulatory frameworks related to their placing on the market.
?	Generate data to support improved environmental, social, health and safety performance, in a life-cycle perspective and taking into account potential trade-offs and indirect consequences, including outside of the EU where relevant.
?	Analyse vulnerabilities, barriers, dependencies, and need for critical infrastructure that may hinder the upscaling of production and marketing of the newly developed alternative soil-friendly practices, by professional producers as well as private consumers in amateur horticulture, and where relevant suggest policy measures to overcome obstacles.
In this topic the multi-actor approach has to be implemented by involving a wide range of stakeholders (e.g. industry including SMEs, public authorities, research centres, public and private investors, civil society) to co-create sustainable solutions and increase opportunities for them to be scaled up.
The proposals selected under this topic should dedicate the necessary resources to work closely together to maximise synergies. Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the EU Soil Observatory and other projects to be funded under the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?. Furthermore, proposals should take into account and build on outputs from other relevant projects such as e.g. EXCALIBUR179 Potentially, the projects funded under this topic could also cooperate with living labs and lighthouses that will be created in this call or future calls of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-06, Soils in spatial planning,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 7.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Activities under this topic will support a more structured approach to sustainable land management in line with global commitments for land degradation neutrality180 and EU efforts for a balanced development of the EU territory. This will help to sustain ecosystems in rural and urban areas as aimed for in the EU Long-term Vision for Rural Areas and other EU Green Deal strategies. Activities will in particular contribute to the implementation of the roadmap towards no net land take and reduced soil degradation as defined under the EU Soil Strategy181.
Project results should contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	The value of ecosystem services provided by soils is more systematically recognised and integrated in spatial planning and land use decisions in urban and rural areas due to increased awareness of spatial planning authorities on the importance of soil functions and soil health overall. As a consequence the demand for the provision of soil ecosystem services and other societal demands for land are more easily reconciled ?	Municipalities and public authorities have information, data and planning tools at hand to develop and implement (participatory) strategies for more adaptive land management in accordance with land neutrality targets (no net land take by 2050), this allowing to increase land use efficiency, reduce soil sealing and apply the principles of the ?land take hierarchy?182.

?	Spatial plans promote the use of nature-based solutions for the improvement of ecosystem services provision, in particular on currently sealed areas.
?	Approaches for rezoning, restoration and de-sealing are available for building land and infrastructure which is no longer in use or to be reused.
Scope: Land is a limited resource and needs to be managed carefully to meet the various, conflicting societal demands on land and soil. These demands arise e.g. from urbanisation, food/biomass production and environmental protection. Inadequate practices in land management and in land use planning are main drivers of land degradation and result in the loss of important soil functions. In urban areas for example, soil sealing leads to reduced evaporation and infiltration of water into the soil. As a consequence, the risk of floods and heat waves in cities increases significantly. In rural areas, fragmented landscapes lead to a loss of habitats for species and to reduced capacities of soils to perform important functions such as water regulation or carbon storage. At the same time, pressures on rural housing, especially in the aftermath of COVID-19, also call for adequate planning to ensure that soil and land management addresses the manifold needs of rural populations. Spatial planning has a considerable role in steering a more balanced and sustainable use of land and ensuring that net land take is reduced, in particular if applying the principles of a ?land take hierarchy?183.
Activities under this topic should identify mechanisms and highlight associated benefits that accrue from the increased consideration of soil functions by the spatial planning sector, both in urban and rural environments.
Proposed activities should:

?	Undertake a systematic review and analysis of how soils, their functions and ecosystem services as well as soil threats are considered in the various levels of spatial planning systems in the EU and Associated Countries.
?	Improve the knowledge on trade-offs required to maintain the provision of ecosystem services in the context of further expanding urban, peri-urban and rural areas.
?	Identify good planning practices that integrate soils and their ecosystem services into spatial planning and show the impact of these practices on actual land use in urban and rural areas such as on: land take, the re-use of land, restoration, de-sealing and the support to soil functions. In addition to examples from Member States and Associated Countries, good experiences from Third Countries could be highlighted as well. Due attention shall be given to examples promoting soil functions and reducing soil sealing through nature-based solutions.
?	Work together with public authorities to develop strategies for zero net land take by 2050 and provide practical recommendations for a better integration of soils into existing spatial planning practices, taking into account synergies with the management of other resources such as water. Activities should identify the main bottlenecks for the adoption of planning systems which are based on more integrated, sustainable and resource efficient use of land.
?	Provide opportunities for training of planners and exchange of experiences (e.g. events, information tools) between the various actors involved in (participatory) planning processes and land use decisions at various levels.
?	Improve the tools as well as the data and information basis (including maps) available to spatial planners and decision-makers regarding soil functions and ecosystem services.
The selected project(s) should liaise with the Joint Research Centre to make sure that relevant data, maps and information can potentially be used and displayed by the European Soil Observatory.

Activities should also contribute to the Education for Climate Coalition185 and to the Long-term vision for EU?s rural areas186 as the Mission is one of its flagship initiatives.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Increased societal awareness of the importance of soil and the challenges it faces, as well as engagement in the protection and restoration of soil health.
?	Improved access to innovative methodologies (including digital ones, but not limited to these) to communicate as well as to engage citizens in the protection and restoration of soil health.
?	Cultural and creative industries (CCIs), artists and civil society organisations are mobilised, along with universities, research institutes and public institutions, to increase awareness and citizens? engagement in the protection and restoration of soil health.
?	Increased soil literacy of policy-makers at different levels (e.g. European, national, regional and local) and their capacity to engage the population in the protection and restoration of soil health.
Scope: CCIs, artists and civil society organisations can play a significant role in the green transition in general, and in the protection and restoration of soil health. Indeed, the cultural and creative sectors, as well as civil society organisations, can address environmental sustainability issues in various ways: first of all, by ensuring that their activities are sustainable (e.g. in their events they can avoid the use of single-use plastics or serve organic food); secondly, they can contribute to green other sectors (e.g. organisations that offer training for home or office composting); and finally, they are key in raising awareness, for example on the importance of soil and its functions for society (e.g. documentaries communication campaigns, podcasts, music, etc.), and in engaging people (e.g. innovative methods can be used to engage people in participatory processes).
The cultural and creative sectors were particularly affected during the COVID-19 crisis, but they ?are a significant driver of local development through job creation and income generation, and generate important spillovers to the wider economy? 187 as well as to the society.
CCIs, artists, and civil society organisations working together with soil experts, can contribute to increase soil literacy by mobilising and engaging the population in the protection and restoration of soil health as well as in tackling soil challenges. Various and innovative methodologies and tools to increase citizens? awareness and engagement should be tested. .
The successful proposal should:

?	Establish a network of relevant actors (e.g. artists, soil scientists, researchers, communication and engagement experts, public authorities ? including local administrations) and projects around art, humanities, cultural and creative industries, that can serve to elevate the importance and value of soils in the context of citizen?s lives by increasing people awareness and engagement.
?	Include all relevant actors from the beginning, but the network should be expanded during the life of the project by providing financial support to third parties of up to 150 000 ? per project or initiative. The total amount of budget to be granted through financial support to third parties should correspond to at least 60% of the total budget of the topic. This financial support should be used to fund smaller projects or initiatives to work in the activities listed below and contribute to the overall goal of increasing soil literacy across society. In selecting the projects, the consortium should take into consideration quality, geographical balance and coverage aiming at covering several Member States and Associated Countries, and include a variety of territories ensuring that both rural and urban areas are covered. The selection process for these projects will be based on principles of transparency, fairness and objectivity.
?	Coordinate, monitor (appropriate indicators and KPIs should be identified) and evaluate the actions of the projects and initiatives from third parties receiving financial support. It is also expected to scale up successful initiatives and to contribute to the implementation of the below-mentioned activities, in particular when it comes to run an innovative communication campaign and to build capacities of policy makers at different levels on how to best engage the population in the protection and restoration of soil health.
?	Organise an annual festival open to the public with the participation of the projects and initiatives financed through the financial support to third parties, where the activities aimed at increasing soil literacy across society are amplified to reach a broader audience In the organisation of the festival, the proposal should consider accessibility, inclusiveness and sustainability. The proposal should also include a long-term plan to ensure the continuity of the festival beyond the life of the Horizon Europe funded project.
The projects and initiatives financed through the financial support to third parties should:

?	Run innovative communication campaigns through different tools (e.g. social media, magazines, podcasts, posters, arts, movies, documentaries) to raise awareness on the importance of soil and engage citizen proposing hand-on activities identified as sustainable practices by soil scientists. The campaigns should highlight the relevance that soil has in people?s daily life and link it with people?s values.
?	Engage citizens in the protection and preservation of soil as well as in tackling soil challenges (such as contamination, erosion, etc.), through innovative, participatory and creative methodologies (e.g. by applying arts-based methods for transformative engagement, citizen assemblies, by organising training on composting and by setting up community composting spaces, community park management, community vegetable gardens).
?	Design and provide tools and materials for supporting administrations at different levels (e.g. European, national, regional and local) in engaging citizens in the protection and restoration of soil health.
?	Build capacities of policy-makers at different levels (local, regional, national and international) and provide examples on how to best engage citizens on soil protection and restoration activities.
Proposals must implement the multi-actor approach and involve a wide range of actors, such as artists, cultural and creative industries, civil society organisations, citizen engagement experts and public authorities, along with soil scientists.

HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-08, Co-creating solutions for soil health in Living Labs,9/20/2023,RIA,1/17/2023,,,Around 12.00-3,"Expected Outcome: Activities under this topic respond directly to the goal of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?189 of setting up 100 living labs by 2027 to lead the transition to healthy soils by 2030. They support the specific objectives of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? dealing with urgent soil health challenges (see in particular specific objectives 1 to 6 and 8). Activities should also contribute to meeting the European Green Deal ambitions and targets, such as those related to food and nutrition security, climate, biodiversity, environment and rural areas190.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Living labs across Europe are fully operational and have established themselves as places for co-creation and testing of solutions for soil health in rural and urban areas.
 ?	Increased capacities for participatory, inter- and transdisciplinary R&I approaches, allowing for effective cooperation between research, practice and policy to tackle soil health challenges.
?	Practice oriented knowledge and tools are more easily available to land managers and contribute to an enhanced uptake of solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across regions where the selected living labs are operating.
?	Improved collaborations between rural and urban areas as well as across sectors on soil health issues and increased consideration of effective solutions in regions where the selected living labs are operating.
?	Accelerated production of accurate knowledge and uptake of innovations by land managers or other actors from various sectors in and beyond the living labs where projects are operating.
?	Policy makers are more aware of local needs with regard to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies.
?	Strengthened science-practice-policy dialogues and increased availability of data inform policy instruments and promote soil health in the EU and Associated Countries more effectively.
Scope: While more research is still needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and green European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a rapid green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner, involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impacts. Living labs will put soil and agronomic sciences at the service of local user-centred experimentations and will promote the uptake of results from research on the ground.
Nowadays, there exist various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, in real-life sites and involving the end-user191. For the purpose of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?, ?Soil health living labs? are defined as ?user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption?. Living labs are collaborations between multiple partners that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level192. These ?experimental sites? could represent e.g. farms, forest stands, urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other entities, where the work is carried-out and monitored under real-life conditions regardless of the land size, tenure (land ownerships) or the type of economic activity. With regard to agricultural lands, work should focus on sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and benefit both conventional and organic farming.
Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as ?places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement?. They are individual, local sites (one farm, one forest exploitation, one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that can either be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.
According to the Mission Implementation Plan, it is expected that each living lab involves partners from different backgrounds, disciplines and sectors and carries out work on about 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context (land use, soil health challenge, etc.), applicants can propose living labs with fewer number of experimental sites. By working together on themes of common interest, the various partners involved in a living lab will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting. The partners can be involved in all or some of the steps of the co-creation process (e.g. planning of experiments, research and lab analysis, testing in real-life conditions, monitoring and evaluation of activities, outreach and communication, dissemination of results), depending on their area of expertise.
More specifically, proposed activities should:

?	Set up four to five living labs (or more, as applicable to the land use(s) and purpose of the project) to work together on thematically related soil health challenges, covering one or several land use types. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rational for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission?s specific objectives193. Living labs on carbon farming are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic for carbon farming living labs is opened in this work programme194 ?	Establish, based on the projects? goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co- development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions.
?	Carry out participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs in view of seeking practical solutions to problems/challenges identified, taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Moreover, challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions should be addressed. Proposed strategies and solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts where living labs are functioning.
?	Identify those sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.
?	Establish a baseline for the selected soils health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions of soils in the different sites over time and a clear monitoring of the progress of the project. When necessary, make use of the set of output soil health indicators presented in the Soil Mission Implementation Plan. To this end, work closely with the European Commission?s Joint Research Centre (JRC) to contribute to their efforts on soil monitoring, the development of the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the EU baseline datasets for agreed indicators in the EUSO Soil Dashboard developed under the Administrative Agreement with JRC195.
?	Carry out an assessment of the possible long-term effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the economic feasibility and viability of the proposed solutions. Monitor the effectiveness of the introduced solutions to improve soil health and assess the contribution of the project results to strengthen policy recommendations at EU, national and regional levels.
?	Propose financial and administrative strategies to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity of the living labs beyond Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs, etc.
?	Document in an easy and accessible way the developed solutions in order to communicate with society at large, in close collaboration with the dedicated ?Living Lab Support Structure? to be established by the Specific Grant Agreement under this Work Programme196.
In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach. The list of stakeholders will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and can involve different types of actors such as researchers, land owners or land managers, industry (e.g. SMEs), public administrations, representatives of civil society (e.g. consumers, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved in the project. For example, while some partners may lead the conceptual work and coordinate the work within and across living labs, others may focus on carrying-out experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or be involved in outreach activities.
To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties.
Proposals may provide financial support to third parties by launching cascading grant call(s) to implement one or more of the Living Lab activities described in this topic197. Applicants are reminded to consult the standard conditions for ?financial support to third parties? set out in Annex B of the General Annexes.
The grants size should depend on the role and type of experimentation performed by the recipients of support to third parties, the maximum amount to be granted to each third party being EUR 200 000 for the duration of the project.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, and appropriate resources, on how they will collaborate with other projects funded under this topic and with projects funded under other Work Programme topics of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? which are relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s). In addition, proposals should seek for synergies with projects PREPSOIL198, NATI00NS199 and NBSSOIL200. Additionally, projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of a dedicated ?Living Lab Support Structure? to be established by the Specific Grant Agreement under this Work Programme.
Cooperation with relevant networks active at local level, such as EIP-AGRI operational groups, is encouraged, in order to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders in living labs activities or in the dissemination of solutions. The projects should also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs) or the ?European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition: Agroecology living labs and research infrastructures?, which will also support living labs. Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO).",

Research and innovation will also contribute to this goal, providing further solutions to farmers and foresters. Measures to achieve this goal include: standardising the monitoring, reporting and verification methodologies needed to provide a clear and reliable certification framework for carbon farming, allowing for developing voluntary carbon markets; and provide improved knowledge, data management and tailored advisory services to land managers.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:

?	Increased carbon sequestration in soils, living biomass and dead organic matter, with environmental co-benefits safeguarded or enhanced, in different regions within the EU and Associated Countries where the selected living labs are operating.

?	Accelerated production of accurate knowledge and uptake of innovations by land managers or other actors from various sectors in and beyond the living labs where projects are operating.
?	Policy-makers are more aware of local needs with regard to carbon farming and can use knowledge to design and implement more effective policies.
?	Strengthened science-practice-policy dialogues and increased availability of data from the ground to inform policy instruments and promote natural solutions for carbon sequestration in the EU and Associated Countries.
Scope: Carbon farming can be defined as a green business model that rewards land managers for taking up improved land management practices, resulting in the increase of carbon sequestration in living biomass, dead organic matter and soils by enhancing carbon capture and/or reducing the release of carbon to the atmosphere, in respect of ecological principles favourable to biodiversity and the natural capital overall205 More research is still needed to increase removals of carbon from the atmosphere and achieve the EU's legally binding commitment to become climate neutral by 2050, as well as to close the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?, proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a rapid green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co- creative manner, involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impacts. Living labs will put soil and agronomic sciences at the service of local user-centred experimentations and will promote the uptake of results from research on the ground.
Nowadays, there exist various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, in real-life sites and involving the end-user206. For the purpose of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe?, ?Soil health living labs? are defined as ?user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption?.
Living labs are collaborations between multiple partners that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level207. These ?experimental sites? could represent e.g. farms, forest stands, urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other entities, where the work is carried-out and monitored under real-life conditions regardless of the land size, tenure (land ownerships) or the type of economic activity. With regard to agricultural lands, work should focus on sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and benefit both conventional and organic farming.
Lighthouses in contrast are defined as ?places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement?. They are individual, local sites (one farm, one forest exploitation, one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that can either be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.
According to the Mission Implementation Plan, it is expected that each living lab involves partners from different backgrounds, disciplines and sectors and carries out work on about 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context (land use, soil health challenge, etc.), applicants can propose living labs with fewer number of experimental sites. By working together in a carbon farming living lab, the various partners involved will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting. The partners can be involved in all or some of the steps of the co-creation process (e.g. planning of experiments, research and lab analysis, testing in real-life conditions, monitoring and evaluation of activities, outreach and communication, dissemination of results), depending on their area of expertise.
More specifically, proposed activities should:

?	Set up four to five living labs (or more, as applicable to the land use(s) and purpose of the project) to work together on carbon farming, covering one or several land use types. The living labs shall be located in at least, three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rational for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to the Mission?s specific objective 2.
?	Carry out participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs in view of seeking practical solutions to carbon farming challenges, taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Moreover, challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions should be addressed. Proposed strategies and solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts where living labs are functioning.
?	Identify those sites that demonstrate high performance in carbon farming and that may be converted into lighthouses.
?	Establish a baseline for carbon farming, in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions of soils in the different sites over time and a clear monitoring of the progress of the project. Where and when available, make use of relevant accounting methodologies for quantification of carbon removals, addressing the durability, additionality and environmental safeguards/co-benefits of carbon farming. When necessary, make use of the set of output soil health indicators presented in the Soil Mission Implementation Plan. To this end, work closely with the European Commission?s Joint Research Centre (JRC) to contribute to their efforts on soil monitoring, the development of the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the EU baseline datasets for agreed indicators in the EUSO Soil Dashboard developed under the Administrative Agreement with JRC208.
?	Carry out an assessment of the possible long-term effects of the newly developed innovative practices for carbon farming. This should include a demonstration of the economic feasibility and viability of the proposed solutions. Monitor the effectiveness of the introduced solutions for carbon sequestration and assess the contribution of the project results to strengthen policy recommendations at EU, national and regional levels. ?	Propose financial and administrative strategies to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity of the living labs beyond Horizon Europe funding, including through identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs, etc.
?	Document in an easy and accessible way the newly developed solutions in order to communicate with society at large, in close collaboration with the dedicated ?Living Lab Support Structure? to be established by the Specific Grant Agreement under this Work Programme209.
In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach. The list of stakeholders will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and can involve different types of actors such as researchers, land owners or land managers, industry (incl. SMEs), public administrations, representatives of civil society (e.g. consumers, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved in the project. For example, while some partners may lead the conceptual work and coordinate the work within and across living labs, others may focus on carrying out experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or be involved in outreach activities.
To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties.
Proposals may provide financial support to third parties by launching cascading grant call(s) to implement one or more of the Living Lab activities described in this topic210. Applicants are reminded to consult the standard conditions for ?financial support to third parties? set out in Annex B of the General Annexes.
The grants size should depend on the role and type of experimentation performed by the recipients of support to third parties, the maximum amount to be granted to each third party being EUR 200 000 for the duration of the project.
Proposals should include a dedicated task, and appropriate resources, on how they will collaborate with projects funded under other Work Programme topics of the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? which are relevant to carbon farming and related challenges (such as, but not limited to, HORIZON-MISS-2022-SOIL-01-06: Network on carbon farming for agricultural and forest soils). In addition, proposals should seek synergies with projects PREPSOIL211 NATI00NS212 and NBSSOIL213. Additionally, projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of a dedicated ?Living Lab Support Structure? to be established by the Specific Grant Agreement under this Work Programme.
Cooperation with relevant networks active at local level, such as EIP-AGRI operational groups, is encouraged, in order to promote the involvement of key local stakeholders in living labs? activities or in the dissemination of solutions. The project should also build on other existing activities and ensure cooperation with relevant projects and partnerships, such as EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (EIT KICs), or the ?European partnership on accelerating farming systems transition: Agroecology living labs and research infrastructures? which will also support living labs.
Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO).",

?	Innovative monitoring230 frameworks and key performance indicators, accounting, as appropriate, for the established ones, to monitor the performance and assess the performance and impact of the deployed solutions regarding climate mitigation, adaptation and regeneration against a well-defined baseline at the start of the project;
?	Contribution, as appropriate, to the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission (hereafter referred to as the Cities Mission), the Adaptation to climate change Mission (hereafter referred to as the Climate Mission), as well as other urban relevant policies and initiatives such as the Zero Pollution Action Plan, Biodiversity Strategy, Fit for 55 Strategy, EU Urban Mobility Framework, Water Framework Directive, Circular Economy Action Plan, European Urban Initiative, Urban Agenda for the EU, New Leipzig Charter, Europe?s Digital Decade, the European partnership on Driving Urban Transitions for a sustainable future (DUT) and the New European Bauhaus Initiative.
Scope: Cities are at the forefront of tackling climate change and pollution and managing impacts through mitigation and adaptation measures. However, while in the last decade local and regional authorities gained a better understanding of the inter-related climate challenges and urgencies of their territories, less has been undertaken to effectively implement and assess climate mitigation and adaptation specific approaches and, in consequence, to adopt them into the local urban/regional policies, strategies and planning documentations, such as municipal/regional master planning, Urban Agendas, Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan (SUMPs), Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP), Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP), smart specialisation strategies etc.
To meet the objectives of the European Green Deal, the Paris and Glasgow agreement and the UN (United Nations) Sustainable Development Goals, cities in close cooperation with their surrounding region, should engage in decisive actions to tackle the climate change, biodiversity and pollution imperatives and enhance their climate resilience.
It is widely acknowledged231 that urban ?greening? and renaturing approaches and solutions, if properly designed and maintained, can address simultaneously climate change mitigation and adaptation challenges by reducing GHG emissions and atmospheric concentrations, energy demands for e.g. mobility, wastewater treatment, heating and cooling. They can also contribute to significant regeneration and upgrading of built environment whilst delivering multiple co-benefits in terms of biodiversity conservation and enhancement, cleaner air, water and soil, noise reduction, flood risks mitigation, public health and well-being.
The objective of this topic is to explore and demonstrate how to operationalize collaborative climate mitigation and adaptation urban planning approaches deploying ?greening? and renaturing solutions for regeneration, re-purposing, rehabilitation and pollution abatement purposes. The co-created plans should be in line with the guiding principles of the European Green Deal and the New European Bauhaus initiative.
To this end, it invites for demonstration actions in at least four ?lead? cities accompanied by at least four ?replicator? cities, representing good geographical, climate and socio-economic diversity across Europe and situated each in a different Member State or Associated Country, where existent urban structure and fabric allow rehabilitation, regeneration, re-purposing or (re)conversion of areas such as large scale social housing districts, deprived districts and neighbourhoods, neglected or abandoned areas and brownfields, derelict industrial sites or dysfunctional urban places through greening and renaturing.
Actions are expected to:

?	Set-up in each participating city collaborative platforms (such as living labs) depicting multi-level, and multi-disciplinary governance structures and engaging local authorities, citizens, stakeholders and relevant actors232 and expertise233 for the co-design, testing and demonstration of co-created urban rehabilitation, regeneration, re-purposing or (re)conversion plans deploying greening and re-naturing approaches to foster more climate neutral, resilient, liveable, sustainable and functional cities with thriving nature, communities and economic activities;
?	Ensure that the regional dimension concerning climate adaptation is properly accounted for through the continuous and seamless involvement of competent regional authorities responsible for the design and implementation of the regional climate mitigation and adaptation measures to ensure cross-scalar (city/region) compatibility and coherence of the urban/regional climate mitigation and adaptation plans.
Actions should also foresee assessment, quantitative and qualitative, ex-ante and ex-post, of the impact of combining and integrating different greening and re-naturing interventions and actions both at local and at regional level based on robust monitoring schemes and using, as appropriate, existing methodologies and indicators.
The ?lead? demonstration cities must, further to the development of the above mentioned plans, also foresee actual implementation of the co-created interventions during the life of the project. To this end, concrete implementation actions and associated costs should be described under a dedicated Work Package or a task The replicator/follower cities, under the proactive guidance and mentoring of the lead cities, should develop their co-created plans, measures and interventions with not obligation for their actual implementation during the life of the project.
To support the integrated planning process and facilitate involvement of citizens in the decision-making process, actions should make effective use of digital tools (e.g. digital twins) integrating cross-domain static, real time and historic data from observations, modelling and simulation whilst making use of open standards and technical specifications.
Actions should engage in clustering activities with other like-minded projects funded under this topic, other relevant projects234 and projects supported under the Climate-neutral and smart cities and Climate Adaption Missions to promote synergies and complementarities.
Although concrete actions for such activities would only be identified in an early stage in the projects? lifetime, appropriate provisions and resources enabling their implementation should be put aside at the proposal level in a clearly identifiable work package. Furthermore, actions should engage in ambitious outreach, communication, dissemination and training activities to foster replication, upscaling and up-taking of the projects? outputs beyond the projects consortia.
To maximise impacts, in carrying out these activities, actions are strongly recommended to work in coordination and complementarity with the ?Climate-neutral and smart cities? and the (soon to be established) ?Climate Adaptation? Mission Platforms. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives, such as the European partnership on Driving Urban Transitions for a sustainable future (DUT), the upcoming European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Urban Agenda for the EU235 , the CSA project selected from the call HORIZON-MISS-2021- CIT-01-02, the Covenant of Mayors, the CIVITAS initiative, the Living-in.EU initiative and the New European Bauhaus Community and NEBLab",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-CLIMA-OCEAN-SOIL-01-01," Mission Climate adaptation, Mission Ocean & waters and Mission Soil Deal for Europe ? Joint demonstration of an integrated approach to increasing landscape water retention capacity at regional scale",9/20/2023,IA,1/17/2023,,,Around 15.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:
?	Demonstrated effective and inclusive integrated approaches to the management of landscape, soil, water and vegetation at a regional level, to increase the resilience to climate change impacts on soils, waters, habitats and biodiversity; ?	Demonstrated effective nature-based solutions and ecological approaches to increase landscape water retention capacity, including soil water retention capacity;
?	Demonstrated economic feasibility of these solutions, ensuring their long term sustainability;
?	Enhanced implementation of the European Green Deal, the EU Adaptation Strategy, the EU Biodiversity Strategy, EU legislation for the protection of freshwaters (such as the EU Water Framework Directive and EU Groundwater Directive) and the EU Soil Strategy for 2030;
?	Better information and greater mobilisation of all relevant actors, including citizens, local and regional authorities and planning bodies, farmers, foresters, land owners, business owners and economic operators, soil protection and management organisations, water management and planning bodies, for an effective and sustainable governance of soil, water and all other landscape components to achieve climate change resilience and increase water retention in the landscape.
Scope: This joint topic relates to the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission?s third objective, aiming to support at least 75 full-scale deep demonstrations of climate resilience, to the Mission Ocean & Waters? objective 1, protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, and objective 2, prevent and eliminate pollution of marine and freshwaters. The topic also relates to several specific objectives of the Mission ""A Soil Deal for Europe"", including to the objectives to reduce soil degradation and soil sealing and to prevent erosion. It also contributes to the objectives of the Water Framework Directive (WFD)240, including achieving Good Ecological and Chemical Status and restoration of aquatic ecosystems, and to the objectives of the Groundwater Directive as regards improvement of chemical status of ground waters.
Landscape water retention capacity is understood as the ability of water bodies, soils and other ecosystems to retain water after it has fallen as precipitation; it is fundamental for the protection of biological diversity as life depends on water. High landscape water retention capacity prevents accelerated surface run-off, increases water content in soils and surface and ground water availability for vegetation, improves the quantity and quality of groundwater and aquifer recharge, reduces soil erosion and nutrient run off into surface water bodies, and improves local micro-climate by reducing local air and biomass temperature. As such, it has the potential to prevent and mitigate impacts of extreme hydrological events such as floods and to act as a buffer against heat extremes. Permanent vegetation in a landscape, such as forest areas, wetlands and permanent grasslands, significantly improves water retention capacity.
Projects should demonstrate socio-ecological approaches and nature-based solutions to increase landscape and soil water retention capacity, leading to improvement of quality and quantity of ground and surface waters in the area where they are deployed, and boosting resilience to climate change impacts. A combination of nature-based measures with hybrid solutions and relevant Blue-Green engineering may be considered, provided these combined solutions are sustainable and provide adequate social and environmental safeguards.
The consortium must carry out demonstration activities in 3 different Member States or Associated Countries, involving and including in the consortium partners from these respective countries. Proposals under this topic should comprise full-scale demonstration of innovative solutions in real conditions of landscapes in the countries selected for demonstration activities241, with specific impacts leading to a measurable increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity of the areas involved, whilst contributing to climate change mitigation, surface and ground water quality, soil health improvement and biodiversity protection and conservation. Applying a multi-actor approach, demonstrations should be carried out at the level of socio-ecological territorial units that are large enough to allow covering the different living and non-living systems (soil, water, vegetation and other biota, human communities, etc.) in a landscape and the complex web of relations among them (e.g. a region or a sea/river basin).
Planning, implementation and management of effective measures to increase landscape water retention capacity requires involvement of various stakeholders and their expertise, such as land, owners, spatial planning and other local and regional authorities, soil protection and management experts, water management and planning bodies, landscape planning experts, farmers and forest managers. Local authorities and local communities should be involved in the design and implementation of the solutions, to ensure that these are well suited for local needs and conditions and are ?owned? by the local communities. Activities should, therefore, promote the involvement of local communities as well as the relevant authorities, to consider with them the impact of intended actions, and to co-create measures while taking local communities? needs and values on board. The proposals should involve citizens, including where appropriate European volunteer/solidarity corps, and relevant citizen science activities.
The project(s) should also identify, create and disseminate best-practice examples for end- users (e.g. farmers and other land managers, decision-makers, water management authorities, landscape planners) to ensure landscape water retention capacity in the long term, including soil water retention capacity, with a view to boosting resilience to climate change, preventing biodiversity loss and promoting at the same time socio-economic transition processes in an ecosystem-based and circular economy perspective, and promote those best practices among the end users.
The demonstration sites established within the project(s) funded under this topic could qualify as ?lighthouses?242 in the sense of the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe if and when they comply with the criteria laid down in the Implementation Plan of that Mission Proposals should both:

?	Involve at least five ?associated regions?243 as third parties, to showcase the feasibility, replicability and possibility to scale up the solutions developed. The consortium will proactively reach out to these associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities, transferring knowledge to them and technical assistance to build capacity and to implement integrated approaches for landscape, water and soil management to increase landscape water retention capacity in their territories; and
?	Draw up an action plan and roadmap to replicate and scale up the solutions within the ?associated regions? and beyond them, to increase landscape water retention capacity, including soil water retention capacity.
As a mechanism to provide knowledge transfer and technical assistance to the associated regions, the selected project should provide support to third parties in the form of grants. The maximum amount of the envisaged Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100 000 per third party for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the process for selection of the third parties to which financial support would be granted, based on the principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness.
The project(s) funded under this topic should address all the below points:

?	Contribute to the networking and coordination activities and joint activities of the three Missions, including by establishing links with projects funded under Horizon 2020244, including the European Green Deal call, and under Horizon Europe, where they are relevant for climate adaptation and soil health knowledge and solutions;
?	Include a mechanism and resources to establish links with the Implementation Support Platform of the Mission Ocean and Waters and build links with other activities of this Mission to maximize synergies;
?	Include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links with the Climate- ADAPT platform (run by the European Environment Agency (EEA) together with DG CLIMA) that will act as a central element for the monitoring, support and visualisation of the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission progress in European Regions. To this purpose, projects will feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments and should include a mechanism to establish links with the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change Implementation Platform;
?	Include a mechanism and resources to establish links with the Implementation Platform being established for the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe; and
?	Support the Ocean and Water Knowledge System245 and the EU Soil Observatory246, in particular by contributing to knowledge creation and data collection.",
HORIZON-MISS-2023-OCEAN-SOIL-01-01, Mission Ocean and Waters and Mission A Soil Deal for Europe ? Joint demonstration of approaches and solutions to address nutrient pollution in the landscape-river-sea system in the Mediterranean sea basin,9/20/2023,IA,1/17/2023,,,Around 8.00-2,"Expected Outcome: This topic contributes to the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Farm to Fork Strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the Soil Strategy for 2030, the Bioeconomy Strategy and the EU Action Plan: 'Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil'. It addresses the Mission ?A Soil Deal for Europe? specific objective 4 ? reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration, targets T.4.2 ? reducing fertiliser use by at least 20% and
T.4.3	? reduce nutrient losses by at least 50%. It relates to the Mission Ocean and waters? objective 2 ? prevent, minimize and remediate pollution of marine and freshwater ecosystems, which has a focus on the Mediterranean Sea basin. It also contributes to the objectives of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD) - including in terms of Good Environmental Status and restoration of aquatic ecosystems - and the Marine Spatial Planning Directive (MSPD).
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	accelerated uptake of innovative, reproducible solutions to prevent, minimise and remediate soil and water pollution from excess nutrients (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) in the landscape-river catchment-sea system and transition waters in the Mediterranean Sea basin;
?	accelerated uptake of innovative, reproducible solutions to reduce the use of fertilisers and to prevent, minimize and remediate nutrient pollution and reduce ocean and inland water eutrophication;
?	foundations for future demonstration and upscaling activities on innovative solutions to prevent, minimise and remediate soil and water pollution from excess nutrients, and to reduce the use of fertilisers, in ?associated regions?;
?	empowerment of citizens to take action against pollution of soils, waters and the ocean Scope: Soils are essential for all life-sustaining processes in our planet. If they are healthy and managed sustainably, they provide many benefits to people, nature and climate. However, 60- 70% of soils in Europe are in an unhealthy condition251. One of the reasons for poor soil health in Europe is the excess of nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) due to an excess of fertiliser applications. The presence of nutrients in soil at concentrations higher than plant requirements not only reduces their capacity for providing their vital ecosystem services, but the nutrient runoff contaminates groundwater, streams, rivers, wetlands, lakes and seas, and increases the risk of water and ocean eutrophication.
Consequently, proposals should demonstrate scalable breakthrough innovations (technological, business, social and governance) in the landscape-river catchment-sea system, including coastal ecosystems, in the Mediterranean Sea basin addressing all following issues:
?	Upstream prevention and reduction of nutrient (especially nitrogen and phosphorus) losses from soil, and of soil and water pollution from excess nutrients, such as through reduction in the use of traditional/mineral fertilisers and/or their sustainable substitution with bio-based fertilisers, improved nutrient retention in soil and slower release to crops, improved nutrient use efficiency, integrated landscape and soil management, reduction of nutrient losses from rural and urban communities;
?	Prevention of entry of nutrients in river catchment areas and their reduction, for example through improved wastewater treatment, use of green filters and other measures for reducing the flow of nutrients through the river system and prevention and reduction of their entry into the estuary/sea;
?	Measures to reduce/eliminate excess nutrients in/from the estuary/sea to reduce or eliminate the risk of eutrophication.
Proposed solutions for pollution prevention, elimination and remediation should not increase the level of anthropogenic air emissions or underwater noise. Proposed solutions should be in line with the EU taxonomy regulation252 and delegated acts.
The consortium must carry out demonstration activities in 3 different Member States or Associated Countries of the Mediterranean basin, involving and including in the consortium partners from these respective countries. The demonstrations should be carried out at the level of territorial units, such as a rural area, an urban community, a region, a river basin or an estuary, to show effectiveness of the demonstrated solutions.
The demonstration of solutions should be fully adapted to the local conditions for reduction of use of fertilisers and of nutrient losses from soil, and they should take place in a real-life demonstrative context (e.g. actual farms and/or forests ) with well-defined system boundaries. Demonstrations should also involve actual users of the solutions (e.g. land owners, soil managers, water managers, river management authorities, etc.). Proposals should ensure a balanced regional distribution of the demonstration sites, taking into account pedo-climatic conditions, topographic conditions, soil types, farming/forestry systems, soil water regimes, and include all relevant elements of the water system (ground waters, surface waters, streams, as well as, where relevant, coastal and estuarine waters).
In line with the impact-driven approach of the Missions, proposals are expected to work with and engage at least five ?associated regions?253 to showcase in additional geographic areas the feasibility, replicability and potential for upscaling of the solutions developed within the projects. The funded projects should ensure that the associated regions are located in Member States/Associated countries other than those that are part of the project consortium. Regions located in European sea basins other than the Mediterranean Sea basin are eligible to be selected as associated regions, with a view to upscaling and deployment of the demonstrated solutions in other areas.
The consortia should proactively reach out to the associated regions to enable them to follow closely the project and its demonstration activities. The projects should continuously share their outcomes and knowledge with associated regions and may provide them with technical assistance to build capacity and to implement solutions to reduce fertiliser use and to prevent, minimise and remediate pollution of soil and water from excess nutrients in their territory. The technical assistance to the associated regions may include advice for the preparation of roadmaps, plans and projects to reduce fertiliser use and to prevent, minimise and remediate pollution from excess nutrients, to address possible barriers and show the feasibility of implementing innovative solutions.
As a mechanism to provide knowledge transfer and technical assistance to the associated regions, the selected projects may provide support to third parties in the form of grants. The maximum amount of the envisaged Financial Support to Third Parties is EUR 100 000 per third party for the entire duration of the action. Proposals should outline the selection process of the third parties to which financial support would be granted based on principles of transparency, objectivity and fairness. An associated region shall benefit from the Financial Support to Third Parties provided under this topic only once.
Proposals should:

?	Ensure the involvement of different stakeholders with complementary expertise in different stages of the projects and take into account the needs of the stakeholders and users;
?	Build upon existing knowledge and solutions and support the upscaling of successful solutions, including from beyond the EU, designed and developed in the frame of projects funded by current and previous European and national programmes, in particular the European Union Framework Programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020);
?	Include dedicated training and communication activities taking place in the demonstration sites, for dissemination and accelerated adoption by other potential users of the innovative solutions demonstrated in the project, as well as for citizen engagement and soil, water and ocean literacy improvement (including for advisory services);
?	Include a mechanism and resources to establish links with the Implementation Support Platform of the Mission Ocean and Waters and the Implementation Platform of the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe; as appropriate, also link with other Missions? relevant initiatives.
?	Include dedicated tasks and adequate resources for coordination measures, networking and joint activities with other relevant projects funded under Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, and in particular with the other project funded under this topic. These coordination measures, networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the organisation of and participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the coordinated development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities.
?	Collaborate with the JRC?s EU Soil Observatory, in particular as regards interoperability, sustainability and longevity of data and knowledge; and
?	Support the Ocean and Water Knowledge System, in particular by contributing to knowledge creation and data collection.
Potentially, projects financed under this topic could cooperate with future Living Labs and Lighthouses created under dedicated call topics from the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe and working in the area of reduction of fertiliser use and of soil pollution from excess nutrients. Moreover, the sites for demonstration of solutions for reduction of use of fertilizers as well as reduction of nutrient losses from soil established within the projects funded under this topic could themselves qualify to be considered as Lighthouses in the sense of the Mission A Soil Deal for Europe, if they comply with the criteria laid down in the Implementation Plan of that Mission254",
HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ACCESS-01-01-two-stage, Teaming for Excellence,4/12/2023,CSA,1/10/2023,,7-Mar-24,8.00 to 15.00-18,"Expected Outcome: Disparities in R&I performance are due to, among other reasons, the insufficient critical mass of science and lack of centres of excellence having sufficient

competence to engage countries and regions strategically in a path of innovative growth. Teaming is responding to this challenge establishing new centres of excellence or modernising existing ones with the help of leading EU or AC partnering institutions. This will help countries to increase their R&I intensity and to attain a competitive position in the European R&I system and globally, especially by becoming drivers of change.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Increased scientific capabilities of the coordinating institution and the host country enabling the the coordinator and other potential entities from that country to successfully apply for competitive funding in the European Union and globally;
?	Improved the R&I culture of the country hosting the co-ordinator (indicators such as research intensity, innovation performance, values towards R&I) through centres of excellence as lighthouses and role models;
?	Stimulus for institutional and systemic reforms and R&I investments at national level taking into account the enabling conditions on governance of smart specialisation introduced under cohesion policy programmes as far as applicable;

Scope: Teaming is one of the actions that stimulates the European Union to exploit its potential by maximising and spreading the benefits of research and innovation. It is vital for its competitiveness and its ability to address societal challenges.
The Teaming action is designed to support the creation of new centres of excellence or upgrading the existing ones in low R&I performing countries (except those centres of excellence that have already benefitted from previous Teaming calls). It is building on partnerships between leading scientific institutions in the European landscape and the main beneficiary institutions in low R&I performing countries that display the willingness to engage together for this purpose. This can help countries that are lagging behind in terms of research and innovation performance attaining a competitive position in the global value chains. Leading scientific institutions are advanced and established partners that have

developed an outstanding reputation in research and innovation excellence in the chosen scientific domain. Institutions that are still in the process of development or modernisation, e.g., those that are still receiving support as coordinators from widening actions under Horizon 2020, are normally not considered leading institutions, unless a proper justification is provided in the proposal.
In order to maximise impact of research and innovation on society, environment and economy at large and to contribute in particular to the achievement of the European Union?s objectives, funding must be coherent and work in synergy. This notion is highly relevant for Teaming action, where a complementary source of funding from a national (or regional or European or private source) is required. The implementation of Teaming action is expected to become an influential and meaningful bridge particularly between smart specialisation strategies and excellence in R&I with the aim of strengthening the European Research Area and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Whatever the source of the required complementary source of funding, a Teaming project, as a notable flagship in its host country, exemplifies not only the achievements in R&I, capacity building or competitiveness, but also sets and facilitates synergies in practice.
The evaluation of the complementary source of funding part may use additional criteria required by, where relevant, the Cohesion Policy programmes and/or legislation. The managers of the complementary funding should apply to the operations the categories, maximum amounts and methods of calculation of eligible costs established under Horizon Europe. In addition, they should be able to apply Art.25 (d) of the revised General Block Exemption Regulation.
Proposals may be evaluated by an additional panel of experts with specific knowledge on complementary funding sources.
In the first stage of evaluation the R&I excellence and the conceptual approach for the centres of excellence will be evaluated. Applicants should present a strategic vision on how to develop R&I excellence beyond the state of the art in the chosen domain and on how the co- ordinator will benefit from the partnership with a leading institution from abroad. In addition, the conceptual approach should outline how the access to complementary funding from other sources will be ensured, in the respect of national, regional and/or European strategies or policy priorities (e.g., notably smart specialisation strategies, Green Deal, Digital transformation). Proposals also should sketch out briefly how the autonomy of the envisaged centre will be ensured and the necessary human resources recruited and retained.
Proposals invited to the second stage must include an investment plan for the full project including a binding commitment for the necessary complementary funding.
At a detailed level the full proposal should:

?	Present a strategy for how the centre will develop excellence in the chosen relevant R&I domain that will put it at the competitive edge beyond the state of the art enabling future success in competitive calls;

?	Demonstrate the growth potential and expected socio-economic outreach of the Centre of Excellence for the benefit of the host country or region;
?	Demonstrate how the project will contribute to encouraging and supporting reforms of the R&I system at regional and or/national level;
?	Elaborate on the structure of the consortium and how this will create a win-win situation;
?	Demonstrate how the newly established/upgraded centre will have full autonomy in decision-making. In particular, the centre of excellence should have the maximum degree of autonomy in terms of taking its own decisions, being in legal, administrative, operational, personnel and academic matters. The Centre should be able to fix and pay competitive salaries for its personnel;
?	Elaborate on the steps that will be taken to ensure long-term self-sustainability after the end of the Horizon Europe grant;
?	Propose a robust human resource strategy that addresses gender equality (in line with the research institutions respective gender equality plans) and international component, ensuring appropriate management capacities for the effective and efficient running of the centre of excellence;
?	In order to assure the autonomy of the centre of excellence, if relevant, the project might benefit of having the centre of excellence coordinating the project within the duration of the Grant;
?	Present an investment plan including the letter(s) of commitment for complementary funding from the competent national/regional authorities or private sources to commit financial resources (e.g., resources coming from programmes co-financed by the ERDF (European regional development fund), IPA (Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) or other sources) for implementing the future centre, in particular regarding investment in infrastructure and equipment. The letter(s) of commitment for complementary funding of the project will be an integral part of the evaluation of the proposal;
?	The grant awarded from the Horizon Europe budget should provide substantial support for the start-up and implementation phase of the future centre of excellence including the recruitment of the managerial, technical and scientific personnel. It should also cover expenses related to team members of the future centre of excellence (e.g., their salaries, recruitment costs8, management costs, travel and subsistence costs);
?	A minor research component can be accepted not exceeding 10% of the total Horizon Europe grant that may include a preparatory research project. Such small research project embedded in the Teaming action should be aligned with the objectives of the project and e.g., serve the purpose of developing and testing new methodologies and instruments and/or the integration of new scientific personnel. If preparatory research

8	This can be considered under the category of ?other goods, works and services?

activity is planned to be carried out, the outline of a respective work plan with an appropriate level of detail should be presented;
?	The duration of the grant should be up to six years.
Proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the project and its expected results in terms of new local and international research and innovation partnerships, institutional and/or R&I system changes (various levels), increased research intensity (i.e. new scientific publications directly linked to the project?s area, protected IPR). Proposals are encouraged to choose any additional relevant indicators that will be used for measuring the impacts achieved.
Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations? commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with European Research Area objectives.",

Topic A: The (usual) Twining Bottom-Up

To prevent further disparities, maximise investment in Research and Development and enhance economic growth, Horizon Europe is taking relevant actions under Widening participation and spreading excellence objective. Twinning actions are one of the main instruments of this objective.
Twinning aims to enhance networking activities between the research institutions of the Widening countries acting as co-ordinators and top-class leading counterparts at European Union level by linking it with at least two research institutions from two different Member States or Associated Countries. Therefore, building on the huge potential of networking for excellence through knowledge transfer and exchange of best practice between research institutions and partners. Twinning actions intend to help raise the research profile of the institution from the Widening country as well as the research profile of its staff including a special focus on strengthening the research management and administrative skills of the coordination institution from the Widening country.
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:

?	Improved excellence capacity and resources in Widening countries enabling to close the still apparent research and innovation gap within the European Union;
?	Enhanced strategic networking activities between the research institutions of the Widening countries and at least two internationally-leading counterparts at European Union level;
?	Raised reputation, research profile and attractiveness of the coordinating institution from the Widening country and the research profile of its staff;
?	Strengthened research management capacities and administrative skills of the staff working in institutions from the Widening country;
?	Improved creativity supported by development of new approaches in Research and Innovation collaboration, increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists.
Scope: Twinning proposals should have to clearly outline the scientific strategy for stepping up and stimulating scientific excellence and innovation capacity in a defined area of research and innovation as well as the scientific quality of the partners involved in the twinning exercise. This scientific strategy should include arrangements for formulating new (or ongoing) joint research / innovation project(s) in the scientific area of choice and describe how Twinning will take this research to a new stage, by enlarging its scope and/or the research / innovation partnerships.

Such a strategy should include a comprehensive set of activities to be supported. These should include at least a number of the following: short-term staff exchanges; expert visits and short term on-site or virtual training; workshops; conference attendance; organisation of joint summer school type activities; dissemination and outreach activities. As far as appropriate these activities should take into account the gender equality plans of the participants.
Proposals should also focus on strengthening the research management and administration skills of the coordinating institution from the Widening country. This should take the form of a dedicated work package or task, placing emphasis to specific activities, in view of helping the staff of the coordinating institution to improve their proposal preparation and project management/administration skills. If not yet in place, setting up/upgrading a research management/administration unit within the coordinating institution would be beneficial. This will be achieved by fully utilising the experience and best practices of the internationally leading partners and is expected to be a concrete deliverable of the Twinning exercise.
A research / innovation component not exceeding 30% of the total Horizon Europe grant may include a research / innovation project. At least 50% of the budget for the research / innovation component must be allocated to the coordinator. This will open opportunities for integrating smaller research / innovation activities and by this strengthening the commitment and the engagement of the twinning partners. The research part of the project should be presented through a dedicated work package and plan including the scientific objectives, tasks and roles of the partners.
The Twinning proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the twinning exercise within the coordinating institution (and possibly at regional/national level) based on indicators such as expected future publications in peer reviewed journals, collaboration agreements with businesses, intellectual property, new innovative products or services, number of international students, number of women scientists and their roles in the research institutions.
It should be explained how the leading scientific institutions in the partnership will contribute in terms of provision of access to new research avenues, creativity and the development of new approaches, as well as acting as a source for increased mobility (inwards and outwards) of qualified scientists and young researchers including doctoral candidates. The benefits for the leading scientific institutions and the way they would materialise through the partnership should be substantiated.
Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations? commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with European Research Area (ERA) objectives, as far as appropriate. The presence of a gender equality plan is an eligibility criterion.

Topic B: The Twinning Green Deal

As regards the Twinning Green Deal, climate change is the biggest challenge and the European Green Deal considers it is an opportunity to build a new economic model. The European Green Deal set the blueprint for this transformational change. All 27 EU Member States committed to turning the EU into the first climate neutral continent by 2050. To get there, they pledged to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. This will create new opportunities for innovation and investment and jobs. It includes research and innovation actions related among others, to transport, industry, energy, buildings? ecological efficiency, nature and health protection, boosting global climate action.
The Twinning Green Deal will therefore focus on a defined area of research / innovation directly linked to at least one of the actions listed in the European Green Deal strategy, notably:
?	Climate research;
?	Green technologies;
?	Renewable energy; ?	Sustainable mobility;
?	Biodiversity research;
?	Sustainable use of natural resources (land, water, air).

Scope: The European Excellence Initiative in its widening dimension aims to raise excellence in science and in knowledge valorisation of Europe?s universities through cooperation. The action will engage with universities and empower them further to be actors of change in R&I.
Through the geographically inclusive cooperation and practice exchange, universities from different capacities benefit and institutional changes towards increased attractiveness and access to excellence are accelerating.
By developing closer cooperation with economic and industrial partners within local and regional innovation ecosystems, academic researchers and support staff will be provided the opportunity to be trained in knowledge valorisation, entrepreneurship, access to finance, at any stage of their careers, and to take into account the variety of academics? activities in their career assessment.
Cooperation of universities will be supported to create critical R&I mass and pursue specific objectives that contribute to accelerating key R&I areas of own choice, for instance, one or more Mission areas. The European Excellence Initiative in its widening dimension is open to any network or alliance of higher education institutions, such as ? but not limited to ? European University alliances, and allows for variable geometries (where for instances universities participating in alliances for specific themes may team up with other partners to pursue other specific themes or objectives). Under this call the centre of gravity of the action must be in Widening countries. Applicants have to convincingly demonstrate this geographical focus, for instance, by a budget allocation of at least 70% to participants from Widening countries.
Projects should contribute to the implementation of ERA Policy Agenda priorities at the participating higher education institutions, notably the strengthening of research careers in academia and beyond. Projects should pursue the following objectives:
?	Achieving more balanced circulation of talents;
?	Reinforcing the role of universities in innovation ecosystems;
?	Mainstreaming practices and tools for open sharing of knowledge and data;

?	Advancements towards reform of the assessment system for research, including career assessment;
?	Improved links between science and business;
?	Promoted gender equality, diversity and fostering inclusiveness through e.g., inclusive gender equality plans and policies;
?	The acceleration of society?s green and digital transition to support ERA Policy Agenda action 11;

The actions should envisage a duration appropriate to the ambition and complexity of the alliance of higher education institutions. The duration should not exceed 5 years.",
HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ACCESS-04-01, Pathways to Synergies,9/28/2023,CSA,3/28/2023,,,0.50 to 1.20-20,"Expected Outcome: Synergies between Horizon Europe and the cohesion policy programmes, mainly the European Fund for Regional Development (ERDF) but also INTERREG and the Resilience and Recovery Fund (RRF), are instrumental for widening countries to catch up in their R&I performance and to reduce the innovation divide in Europe. Although such synergies are already addressed in the Teaming and Excellence Hubs actions under this work programme these instruments do not capture the full range of possible synergies and need to be complemented by a dedicated scheme. The Commission staff working document on ?Synergies between Horizon Europe and ERDF programmes? (SWD(2022) xxx final) presents the new opportunities for achieving operational synergies between Horizon Europe and the ERDF, including for Seal of Excellence, transfer, cumulative funding, combined funding (Co- funded and Institutionalised Partnerships), Teaming, and upstream/downstream synergies. This pilot call offers opportunities to incentivise the concrete realisation of particularly promising sequential synergies in two different pathways either supporting the upstream synergy mode (a) or downstream synergy mode (b) where the former is focusing on human resources development and internationalisation and the latter on valorisation and upscaling of research results towards marketable solutions.
The following overall outcome is expected:

?	Improved and more systematic synergies between Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020, and ERDF, IPA (instrument for pre-accession assistance), RRF, INTERREG or similar funding instruments through internationalisation, valorisation and technology uptake;
?	Strengthened competitiveness of R&I actors in Widening countries;
?	Accelerated knowledge transfer and innovation cycle for beneficiaries from ERDF and Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe;
?	Strengthened innovation capacity and competitiveness of less R&I performing regions.
For actions opting for pathway a) on upstream synergies the following specific outcome is expected:
?	Joint internationalisation strategy for R&I;
?	Human resources development strategy;
?	Improved access to excellent European R&I networks and communities;
?	Increased competitiveness and reputation in applications for European and international research funding;
?	Overcoming locked-in effects for former mono-beneficiaries funded under ERDF;

?	Acquisition of new transferable skills for R&I staff notably in the fields of knowledge transfer, R&I management and communication;
?	Better use of R&I infrastructure funded under ERDF.
For actions opting for pathway b) on downstream synergies the following specific output is expected:
?	Valorisation of results generated in Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020 projects in a regional context;
?	Improved knowledge transfer and technology uptake in less R&I performing regions;
?	Exploitation and diffusion of R&I results into the market in line with national/regional smart specialisation priorities;
?	Preparation of pilots and demonstrators in the chosen R&I domain for funding under ERDF;
?	Improved intellectual asset management and technology uptake.
Scope: The purpose of this action is to provide support for additional efforts required for setting up the interfaces between two different funding systems where major barriers still occur due to the mismatches of regional versus European approach, consortium vs single beneficiary funding and Horizon thematic priorities vs national/regional smart specialisation. Consortia should decide at proposal level which of the two aforementioned pathways is applicable for their needs. This will also influence the composition of the applicant consortium and the choice of funded activities.
More specifically, consortia applying for funding under pathway a) should be composed of a core group of at least three different public or private research entities established in at least two different Widening countries that were beneficiaries from ERDF, RRF or similar investments for R&I including infrastructure in the current or previous programming period. These applicants should provide evidence for (e.g., contract numbers) and a short description of the investment. In addition to this core group other particioants also from non-Widening countries may join if their roles are duly explained and justified e.g., by providing training, coaching, strategic advice, knowledge transfer, hosting staff secondments etc. as long as the EU contribution to these participants does not exceed 30% of the total EU contribution.
The main goal of the pathway a) is to move formerly single beneficiaries of regional funding programmes out of isolation via cross-border collaboration and to prepare them for successful participation in Horizon Europe calls by strengthening their competitiveness by means of a customised bunch of activities. Therefore, proposals should present a coherent and strategically convincing package of activities with a particular focus on internationalisation strategies and human resources development. The latter may include training and coaching on non-scientific skills such as management of international R&I projects, knowledge transfer and science communication. HR capacity building may be complemented by suitable study

visits and short-term secondments to partners. Communication activities including social media should contribute to raising the reputation and visibility of the members of the core group. This may include advertising their technical infrastructure (funded under ERDF) to potential partners in future competitive calls. Early-stage co-operation with NCP organisations is strongly encouraged.
Consortia applying for funding under pathway b) on downstream synergies should be members of a consortium of one or two completed or ongoing projects (in the same domain) RIA(s) funded under Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020 that has already generated validated (e.g., evidenced by approved deliverables, final or periodic reports, peer reviewed publications) research results to be valorised by support from ERDF, IPA, RFF funds or EIC financial instruments. The Horizon consortium should not necessarily participate in its full extent and can be represented by a core group of participants benefitting from valorisation.
For both partways, participants from non-Widening countries may join the consortium, e.g., for the purpose of knowledge transfer as long as the majority of participants are from Widening countries and EU contribution to widening participants is at least at the level of 70% of the total EU contribution. For the valorisation activities the consortium should identify at proposal stage up to three focus regions located in Widening countries where the implementation of downstream synergies actually should take place. Additional partners without contractual relationship especially from the focus regions may be associated, notably regional authorities in charge of managing the ERDF or similar funds and SMEs are especially encouraged and may serve as catalysts for the uptake of R&I results generated under Horizon. Activities, supported under this CSA may include identification and mapping of specific research results for valorisation generated in Horizon projects with a potential for valorisation, matchmaking between HE beneficiaries and ERDF project partners around regional/national S3 priorities, analysis on how existing Horizon project outputs and results can be exploited in line with the territorial needs described in the ERDF/RRF or similar programmes, workshops with management authorities and local business, specification of demonstrators and pilots, IPR management and technology uptake. Special attention should be paid to the preparation of applications to calls under regional programmes. Communication and dissemination activities should contribute to raising the reputation and visibility of EU funded activities in the focus regions. The funding is considered seed funding and no guarantee for the actual acquisition of synergetic funding needs to be given at the level of the proposal.",
HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ACCESS-05-01, Dissemination and Exploitation Support Facility,9/28/2023,CSA,4/26/2023,,,1.00 to 5.00-1,"Expected Outcome: Improving knowledge diffusion, technology uptake and having spill-over effects is fundamental to ensure that researchers and their institutions build on and valorise the latest available knowledge. Moreover, the exploitation of research results and the creation of value for our economy and society, often depend on the skills and abilities of the beneficiaries as well as the intermediaries (i.e., technology/knowledge transfer officers) to present and connect to those stakeholders that can help them take the results into the next level. Especially in Widening countries, R&I actors lack sufficient support and information, skills or connections to the right stakeholders and these gaps can jeopardise their ability to maximise the potential value of their results.
Dissemination & Exploitation (D&E) policy of Horizon Europe can act as an enabler for the implementation of the political objectives of this programme component. Therefore, this action focuses on activities to strengthen or build D&E capacities in Widening countries. It will provide beneficiaries of the ongoing portfolio of projects funded mainly under the programmes: Spreading excellence and Widening Participation under Horizon 2020 and the widening component of Horizon Europe with further opportunities for scaling up their research results and improve the sustainability of their actions. This includes innovations that can translate into / contribute to new products and services that create economic or social value, more efficient production or distribution processes; and results that can feed into policymaking and help citizens and public authorities. The action is framed by a broader D&E policy and will support our beneficiaries towards the maximum dissemination and exploitation of their results in the context of Horizon Europe.
The following specific outcome is expected:

?	Strengthened Dissemination and Exploitation capacities including through better understanding of the Commission?s D&E Strategy and the opportunities it can offer to beneficiaries in need from widening actions;
?	Support to beneficiaries in their dissemination and exploitation of results through a market-oriented approach;
?	Improved skills and knowledge on D&E, knowledge transfer and IP management for researchers and management personnel of beneficiaries of widening actions to be able to fulfil their Horizon Europe Model Grant Agreement obligations, including after the end of their project;
?	Collected and shared best practices for uptake of R&I results and identify the blocking contextual elements that prevent beneficiaries from valorising further their R&I results; Address these blocking factors by proposing measures in the valorisation channels as identified in the EU valorisation policy;
?	Increasing the maturity level of key exploitable results produced by widening beneficiaries;
?	Greater recognition of beneficiaries based in Widening countries at national & regional policy level, as a result of enhanced visibility of D&E success stories;
?	Enhanced synergies between beneficiaries of widening actions in view of networking opportunities and future competitive calls;
?	Improved sustainability of ongoing widening actions;
?	Identify downstream synergies with other EU programmes especially the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).
Scope: This action should be implemented as a CSA awarded to consortia of at least three entities who should have a proven track record of success in D&E and related training, communication and networking. The consortium should establish a facility including training, upskilling, entrepreneurship, access to capital, best practice sharing, knowledge exchange and community of practice building for beneficiaries of the Widening countries with a first priority to beneficiaries of ongoing or completed widening projects funded under Horizon 2020 or Horizon Europe (this action could be extended to other H2020 and HE beneficiaries in Widening countries if budget cannot be exhausted by the widening portfolio). The scope of the services should include the valorisation of research results that were not immediately generated within a widening action but in a related domain under a different funded action. The consortium should ensure that the developed services address the full geographic scope of the Widening countries including Outermost Regions.
Specifically, the consortium should establish a tailor-made service package with training, coaching, mapping of results, experts and study visits, peer support, matchmaking events,

innovation and IP management, knowledge transfer both in an individualised manner and collective workshops. The consortium is expected to closely collaborate with the ongoing NCP network WIDERAnet, other NCP projects and the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN).
It should help beneficiaries to better understand how to fulfil with D&E commitments under Horizon Europe and Horizon 2020 and to seek for opportunities by other community funding programmes especially under the cohesion policy (e.g., ERDF, ESF) as well as the RRF and Reform funds. It should also enhance beneficiaries? knowledge on tools to develop their D&E activities, including, e.g., the tools offered by the Commission for D&E support (e.g., Horizon Results Platform, Horizon Results Booster), effective use of social media and innovative communication channels, IPR (i.g., IP Helpdesk, IP scan, IP voucher, Health Research Board, etc.) & Open data. In addition, it should incentivise beneficiaries to initiate policy dialogues with national and regional institutions and stakeholders aiming at a favourable impact on the modernisation of the national and regional R&I system and creating an innovation friendly culture in Widening countries. Furthermore, the activities should support and motivate beneficiaries of completed and advanced ongoing projects to scale up and valorise their results towards further uptake and commercialisation (e.g., training, networking, start-ups, connection with the investors and the relevant industrial ecosystems, commercialisation support).
This will help to ensure sustainability of widening actions especially Teaming and Excellence Hubs after the end of the funding period.
This consortium should provide a plan detailing its priorities, the key targets, proposed actions, repartition of budget and regular monitoring on achievements and challenges",
HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-ACCESS-07-01, Excellence Hubs,9/28/2023,RIA,1/10/2023,,26-Sep-24,0.10 to 0.60-160,"Expected Outcome: The Hop On Facility allows for legal entities from low R&I performing countries to join already selected collaborative R&I actions, subject to the agreement of the respective consortium and provided that legal entities from such countries are not yet participating in it. The scheme aims to improve the inclusiveness of Horizon Europe by involving more research institutions from Widening countries under Horizon Europe Pillar 2 and EIC Pathfinder actions.
Main selection criteria are excellence and added value of the new partner performing a relevant additional task in the project. All consortium partners need to agree on the accession of the new partner whereas the R&I relevance and complementarity needs to be demonstrated. The accepted application will trigger a GA amendment with the service in charge of the related topic.
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes:

?	At system level, it mobilises excellence in the Widening countries, increases visibility of the participants from the Widening countries, improves knowledge circulation, and reduces lack of participation of the Widening countries in specific thematic domains;
?	At organisation level, it opens up silos of established closed consortia, improves research excellence of the Widening country?s institutions in specific fields, enlarges outreach of the participants? R&I actions and provides access to new talent pools;

?	At the level of the beneficiary, new competencies and skills for working in transnational projects including research management and dissemination and exploitation are acquired.
Scope: The Hop On Facility integrates one additional participant from a Widening country to an ongoing project under Pillar 2 or the EIC pathfinder scheme while topping up a relevant task or work package and the cost incurred by the additional participant. This will happen on a voluntary basis without affecting the freedom of choice for the consortium and the principle of excellence. The Hop On Facility is open to all topics under Pillar 2 and the EIC pathfinder. Applications with activities that contribute to the policy objective of the transition towards a green and digital economy are especially encouraged.
The action will be part of an existing project with a valid Grant Agreement. Applications must demonstrate the R&I added value of the new partner and present a visible and distinct work package for the acceding partner. The proposal should include a detailed description of the profile of the new partner and its role in the existing project. The additional partner and task should be presented in a dedicated proposal template with the Description of the Action (DOA) of the ongoing action uploaded as an annex. Selected consortia will be invited to submit an amendment request for accession of a new partner, modification of the description of the action and upgrade of the budget.
The budget increase must be exclusively for the benefit of the new partner with the exception of a coordination fee of up to 10% of the increased budget to be allocated to the coordinator of the consortium. The coordinator may request the coordination fee and provide an explanation on the additional integration efforts for the new partner",
HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-TALENTS-01-01, ERA Chairs,3/7/2024,CSA,9/28/2023,,,2.00 to 6.00-12,"Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to the following outcomes:

?	Excellent and sustainable place-based R&I ecosystems in Widening countries and beyond in relevant domains of cutting-edge science and innovation;
?	Long term joint R&I strategies underpinned by concrete action plans of European relevance;
?	Common investment plans for R&I including infrastructures leveraging national, regional and European funds as well as private capital in a synergetic manner;
?	R&I pilot projects alongside a joint strategy and in line with regional and national strategies, notably regional innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3) taking into account the new Innovation Agenda for Europe;
?	New competencies and skills for researchers, entrepreneurs and professionals in R&I intensive domains;
?	Strengthened linkages between science and business;
?	Improved knowledge transfer and development of entrepreneurial skills;
?	New business opportunities especially for SMEs, university spin-offs and start-ups, especially deep tech;
?	Inclusion of emerging innovation ecosystems from rural areas, Western Balkans and Eastern Partnership countries including Ukraine by optional mentoring module;
?	Contribute to EU-wide access to excellence, ERA Policy Agenda action 16.

Scope: Excellence hubs are part of the European Excellence Initiative and complement the science-oriented schemes Teaming, Twinning, ERA Chairs and the European Excellence Initiative for universities by a dedicated innovation component. Excellence hubs will focus on innovation by allowing innovation ecosystems in Widening countries and beyond, to team up and create better linkages between academia, business, government and society. This will foster a real place-based innovation culture in Widening countries based on a strategic agenda aligned with regional or national smart specialisation strategies. In this context, synergies will be sought with the programme parts on European Innovation Ecosystems, EIC pathfinder and the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) as well as the initiative ?Partnerships for Regional Innovation? run by the JRC. The excellence hubs will be the basis in Widening countries of the pan-European Innovation Ecosystem of the new Innovation Agenda for Europe.
This action responds to the third priority in the ERA communication on translating R&I results into the economy and will especially support R&I policies aiming at boosting the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies. This means ensuring European competitive leadership in the global race for technology based on excellence while improving the environment for business R&I investment, deployment of new technologies and enhancing the take up and visibility of research results in the economy and society as a whole. This action addresses regions as R&I actors since they are the place where the innovation and industrial ecosystems breath and develop, making the links between Europe and business including SMEs and start-ups, research centres, innovation stakeholders as well as citizens. Regionally developed innovation ecosystems connected across the Europe Union will be the driver of new European strategic value chains.
Unlike Teaming projects that are centred around a single beneficiary Excellence hubs are networks of place-based innovation ecosystems in Widening countries involving larger communities of actors in a regional context based on the quadruple helix principle (see below). Individual participants and ecosystems from other EU Member States, Associated Countries and international co-operation partners may join in duly justified cases e.g., given by a specific expertise needed or the involvement in a relevant value adding chain. The call allows to provide financial support to third parties in the form of grants, especially for the support of start-ups and SMEs. This call is also encouraging emerging innovation ecosystems from less developed regions in rural areas, the Western Balkans or countries participating in the Eastern Partnership notably Ukraine
Projects should be established around the following core components:

?	Cross-border joint R&I strategy aligned with regional smart specialisation strategies and/or European policy priorities such as the green and digital transition;
?	R&I project consolidating academia business linkages and providing evidence for strategy building and investment;

?	Action and investment plans for the implementation of the strategy including the development of business models for innovative products, service and processes to ensure the sustainability of the action beyond the project's life time;
?	Conceptual design and pre-planning for pilots and demonstrators (if applicable) in line with the strategy;
?	Accompanying measures e.g., to raise visibility, citizen engagement, technology transfer, entrepreneurship training, staff exchange, mutual learning, creation of start-ups etc.;
?	Optional: Mentoring of an emerging place-based innovation ecosystem established in rural areas, Western Balkans or Eastern Partnership Countries including Ukraine. Legeal entities from such countries and regions are encouraged to join the project as participants in order to benefit from mentoring, training, knowledge transfer even if their ecosystems are not yet developed to a full quadruple helix structure. This mentoring module does not count for the minimum condition of having at least two fully-fledged quadruple helix innovation ecosystems.
Excellence hubs should improve access to excellence for R&I actors in Widening countries and elaborate joint R&I strategies that are aligned with national, regional (notably RIS3) and/or European strategies or policy priorities (e.g., Green Deal, Digital transition). These strategies will be underpinned by concrete actions plans and an investment strategy that reaches out beyond the project?s lifetime and will leverage national, regional and European funds as well as private (venture) capital. Investment plans may include pertinent R&I infrastructures as well as demonstrators and pilots.
The research component should be developed by joint pilot research projects in a domain covered by the joint strategy that should facilitate long-term cross border and inter-sectoral collaborative links between partners notably academia and business and advancement in science and technology development with market potential. In particular R&I projects should serve the purpose to close knowledge gaps and develop evidence to underpin the development of the strategy and the investment plans. For example, in the R&I projects lab prototypes might be developed leading to the design of pilot plants or demonstrators (see above). However, the realisation of such pilots and demonstrators must be financed by other sources in particular programmes co-financed by the ERDF, INTERREG, IPA or similar. The approach how to access such co-funding at a later stage should be sketched out in the proposal. Notably, for the case of ERDF the proposal should demonstrate the alignment with the pertinent regional smart specialisation.
Accompanying measures are complementary activities that may promote knowledge and technology transfer, mutual learning and skills development especially in research and innovation management and entrepreneurship as well as citizen engagement. Mutual secondments and staff exchange within and between ecosystems should help to build trust and long-term collaborative links.

Ecosystems or individual partners from outside the Widening countries may participate in the consortium as long as they prove added value by facilitating access to excellence for the Widening countries. Proposals should convincingly demonstrate the relevance of the chosen scientific domain by its alignment with regional (in particular RIS3), national and/or European R&I strategies and policy priorities. Applicants may choose between a more regional orientation e.g., proven by a common denominator in their regional smart specialisation strategy and/or a more global orientation towards European policy priorities such as the green or digital transition.
The description of R&I content based on this choice should include a long-term vision beyond the state of the art of the chosen R&I domain. On top of that, proposal should demonstrate the win-win effects of the partnership established by the consortium and the benefits for employment and post crisis recovery. For the implementation, proposals should present a coherent package of actions well-proportioned in terms of strategy development, research, innovation and outreach activities.
Excellence hubs as a new action under the widening component are complementary but different to initiatives such as Digital hubs or the EIT regional innovation scheme (RIS) because of their strategic orientation, broader scope and alignment with widening eligibility criteria.
Proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the project and its expected results in terms of new local and international research and innovation partnerships including business, institutional and/or R&I system changes (various levels), increased research and innovation intensity (i.e., new scientific publications directly linked to the project?s area, protected intellectual assets, marketable products and solutions). Proposals are encouraged to choose any additional relevant indicators that will be used for measuring the impacts achieved.
The expected duration of the project is up to 4 years.",
HORIZON-WIDERA-2023-TALENTS-02-01, ERA Fellowships,3/7/2024,CSA,9/28/2023,,,1.50 to 2.50-45,"Expected Outcome: Progress towards more and better links between research and innovation actors across the European Research Area and beyond is a requirement if Europe as a whole is to capitalise on excellence from across the continent. To foster brain circulation for researchers and innovators the intervention point of the ERA Chairs actions is attracting in a sustainable manner outstanding scientists and innovators to universities or research organisations in catching up countries and regions. This measure of ?brain gain? and the creation of pockets of excellence has an impact on the culture and performance of host institutions.
The leadership of the ERA Chair holder and the creation of a permanent and excellent research group in the chosen scientific field will ensure excellence, visibility and better integration in the European Research Area, as well as fostering competitiveness in research funding and promoting institutional reforms aligned with ERA priorities.
Projects are expected to contribute to some of the following outcomes: At system level:
?	Increase in number of R&I talents moving to host organisations in Widening countries;
?	Increase in international, interdisciplinary and intersectoral mobility of researchers and innovators;
?	Encouraging institutional reforms in research institutions and in the national R&I system in Widening countries;
?	Strengthening of Widening countries? human capital base in R&I with more entrepreneurial and better trained researchers and innovators;
?	Better communication of R&I results to society;
?	Better quality and capacity of research and innovation contributing to Europe's competitiveness and growth;
?	Improved excellence capacity and resources in Widening countries and close the still apparent research and innovation gap within Europe.
At organisation level:

?	Research excellence of the institution in the specific fields covered by the ERA Chair holder;
?	Increased attractiveness of the institution for internationally excellent and mobile researchers;
?	Creation of a permanent and excellent research group in the chosen scientific field with a spill-over effect on the institution;
?	Improved capability to succeed in competitive research funding in the EU and globally, at least, in the fields of choice;
?	Greater contribution to the knowledge-based economy and society.
Scope: Research organisations located in Widening countries interested in establishing an ERA Chair should submit a proposal with the prospective ERA Chair holder who should be

an outstanding researcher and/or innovator in the chosen scientific domain. The scientific field can be any domain of research and innovation.
The research institution in the Widening country will be the coordinator and submit a proposal as a single applicant (monobeneficiary). ERA Chair holders can be citizens of any country in the world.
Proposals should include a Curriculum Vitae in Europass form27 of the future ERA Chair holder and detail the scientific and technical support she/he will provide to the coordinator and how the proposed activities will upgrade from the current situation. The CV should be uploaded as an additional document to the proposal.
Proposals should also describe any relevant investments of the coordinator in research projects, facilities and infrastructures and how those will be achieved and/or a better use of the installed research capacity (in particular of EU co-funded research infrastructures & facilities). Existing or foreseen arrangements for compliance with ERA priorities28 including the European Charter for Researchers & Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers29 are to be outlined in the proposal.
ERA Chair holders should be excellent researchers and/or innovators in the chosen field of research 30 . They should establish a research team fully integrated in the coordinator's institution to significantly improve its research performance in the scientific domain of choice and to be more successful in obtaining competitive funding. The selection of personnel to the research team is to be conducted by an international recruitment panel leaded by the ERA Chair and outlined in proposals. The ERA Chair holder should also have a position within the organisation/university, allowing her/him to make appropriate resource allocation decisions, supervise team members and freely apply for research funding. When this is compatible with the nature of the coordinator, he/she is expected to take on some teaching duties.
To allow for the assessment of the commitment of the future ERA Chair holder and of the coordinator institution, proposals must include: 1) a letter signed by the prospective ERA Chair holder expressing his/her commitment to the proposal and willingness to take on the underlying tasks and obligations; 2) a letter from the head of the coordinator institution committing to the proposal and stating that the ERA Chair holder will receive adequate support to take on her/his tasks and duties including, for example, access to research facilities, supervision of researchers, teaching duties (if any) and capacity to apply freely to national and international funding.
The ERA Chair holders might move on a temporary or permanent basis to the coordinator?s premises. To this end, secondments or any other legal arrangements (e.g., leave without pay, sabbatical licences) are possible including part-time work and multiple stays. All contractual arrangements and the timeline of ERA Chairs stays at the coordinator should be indicated in the proposal as well as the salary, travel and daily allowances and/or other perks to be offered. If, at any stage, the preferred option is an employment contract, the future contractual arrangements with the coordinator should be detailed.
To ensure the sustainability of the action, the ERA Chair research team should have conditions to thrive after the end of the Horizon Europe funding. This should be clearly demonstrated in the proposal and include the appointment of the leader of the newly created research group on a permanent basis within the coordinator organisation (to which the ERA Chair holder might apply) during the initial 3 years of the duration of the grant. This is to be conducted through an open recruitment procedure to be monitored by the European Commission.
Grants have an expected duration of up to 5 years and cover expenses related to the ERA Chair holder and a number of team members (e.g., their salaries, recruitment costs 31 , administrative costs, travel and subsistence costs) and research costs up to 10% of the EU contribution. The grant should also state the measures aimed at introducing structural changes in the institution of the Widening country (e.g., costs for trainings, meetings, publications and managing Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
Specific attention should be paid to gender equality objectives, in line with the organisations? commitments through their adopted gender equality plans, and in line with ERA objectives, as far as appropriate.
The ERA Chairs proposals should illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively the expected potential impact of the project. As such, the projects? expected results should be visible in terms of new local and international research and innovation partnerships, institutional and/or R&I system changes (various levels), increased research intensity (i.e., new scientific publications directly linked to the project?s area, protected IPR) and best research management practices. Proposals are encouraged to choose any additional relevant indicators that will be used for measuring the impacts achieved",

The MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2023 model grant agreement will be used to the ERA Fellowships.
Secondments

Researchers receiving an ERA Fellowship may opt to include a secondment phase, within the overall duration of their fellowship in any country worldwide. The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.
Placements in the non-academic sector

ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non- academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added-value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.
Training activities

The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills34, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g., commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to research and other outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).
