Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Creating, enriching and refining annotated bibliographies</li><li>Documenting the results of fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological excavations or other collection processes and studies</li></ul><p><strong>Creating, enriching and refining annotated bibliographies</strong></p><p>A crucial task in both education and professional duties within cultural heritage is compiling bibliographies. This time-consuming activity entails gathering relevant literature on a cultural heritage object, entering bibliographic references in a list, assessing each document, and producing notes that are subsequently saved in the bibliography. This work has a value of its own, not only as part of the papers or reports created. Bibliographies therefore ought to be kept on the ECCCH, made accessible, and further enriched, refined and extended by collaborative and supervised efforts.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should make sure that the ECCCH offers tools that automate much of the tedious tasks, and support cooperative work and re-use. Existing tools and bibliographic frameworks should be evaluated and when appropriate built upon. The tools to be developed should offer significant added value to its users beyond what is currently available, and should be developed based on the data model of the ECCCH, gathering data from and incorporating data in the ECCCH. These tools may, to the extent feasible, include functionality to parse and enrich data from for instance retrodigitised sources not readily machine readable. Given a topic or a specific heritage object and/or a small initial set of papers selected by the user, enhanced AI technologies working on text or/and on images should be able to retrieve related works, evaluate the fit of a given paper with the subject of the research, and produce a preliminary bibliography. The authoring system should support the creation, editing, and annotation of bibliographies. It should be possible to define with whom the results are shared (e.g. with a restricted group of professionals or with all users).</p><p><strong>Documenting the results of fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological excavations or other collection processes and studies</strong></p><p>Fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological exploration and research typically produce large amounts of different kinds of data, such as survey documentation and documents presenting, narrating and interpreting the findings, photographic data, 3D models, drawings, maps and geographic information system data. At a later stage, most of the findings become assets for cultural heritage institutions such as museums. Such activities (excavation, study, etc.), thus, are a crucial phase of the musealisation process. Moreover, most countries enforce legal obligations regarding the archiving of data produced by excavations, as well as periodic reports.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should offer a set of tools that makes the ECCCH a valuable resource for the community involved in such excavations and studies, using an extensible data model based on semantic technology, as well as a repository for the produced data, together with appropriate data visualisation and analysis instruments. Regulated reporting and archiving obligations in different countries should be analysed, and to the extent possible semi-automatised.</p><p>Ontologies and vocabularies should be extended as needed to define the data structures and relationships between different data, in view of achieving interoperability. Repositories from different institutions and countries should be inter-operable and inter-connected. The semantic information layer should make it possible for AI technologies to access and ""learn"" from the archive. An extension to the ECCCH 3D browser should provide an interactive and visual interface to excavation data, and to the related findings.</p><p>Also, citation capabilities should be integrated, to facilitate publication, sharing and reuse of data. Authoring tools should provide a way for the user to build ""narratives"" starting from the archival data.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>In particular, in order to exploit potential synergies, proposals may consider, where appropriate, to build on the work of the projects funded under the topics HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-04 and HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-03, especially concerning Science Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) as flexible tools to monitor and track events of science linked to provenance, publishing, citation, data processing, data and software usage, as well as service consumption.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.</p><p>Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.</p><p>The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.</p><p>Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.</p><p>The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.</p><p>Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.</p> <p>'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.</p><p>'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.</p><p>""Narratives"" in this context means all documents that use, as their building blocks, the data entities contained in the archive, such as periodic reports, formulation of new interpretations or confutation/discussion of the already existing ones, preparation of scientific papers and publications, set-up of teaching/didactic material, schemes and graphs.</p><p>This by no means imply that partners from such projects need to be part of the consortium.</p>",,"<p>Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[<sup></sup>The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en"">https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en</a>]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.</p><p>The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[<sup></sup>Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? (ECCCH).</p><p>An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[<sup></sup>European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv?nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014</a>]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.</p><p>The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[<sup></sup>See further <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces</a>]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.</p><p>Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:</p><ul><li>The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[<sup></sup>In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.</li><li>The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.</li><li>Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.</li><li>To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.</li><li>The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: <ul><li>digital twins of heritage objects,</li><li>digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,</li><li>digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role.</li> </ul></li><li>The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.</li><li>An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.</li><li>The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.</li><li>The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.</li><li>The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives.</li></ul><p>The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Digitising dynamic objects, processes and practices</li><li>Monitoring the evolving status of cultural heritage objects over time</li><li>Interacting with, cross-mixing and re-mixing different data types</li></ul><p><strong>Digitisation of dynamic objects, processes and practices</strong></p><p>The main focus of 3D digitisation initiatives in the realm of cultural heritage has thus far been the shape and appearance of static objects. Practical techniques and technologies that enable accurate physical simulations of digitised items are mostly unexplored. Mechanical characteristics like stiffness, flexibility, mass distribution and strength, as well as mechanisms and moving parts are still largely undocumented. However, many heritage objects, including human-made devices, machines or practices, exhibit dynamic behaviours. Making adequate and precise digital models of such items and phenomena would enable more realistic simulations of, for instance, ancient artefacts like tissues, mechanisms, tools or practices, which would facilitate more insightful analysis and understanding.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop new digitisation approaches enabling the correct capture of mechanical and dynamic characteristics of objects and practices.</p><p><strong>Monitoring the evolving status of cultural heritage objects over time</strong></p><p>Monitoring the evolution over time of a heritage object is a key task in many cultural heritage contexts. This involves monitoring very slow phenomena (e.g. changes in the reflection attributes of a painted surface) as well as very rapid ones (for example fractures introduced by an abrupt event, such as damages to a loan artwork while traveling, or to a monument due to a seismic impact). The accurate sampling and detection of such changes occurring over time requires a number of new and integrated technologies: shape &amp; colour sampling, use of networks of sensors displaced in a space, data integration, and software technologies able to make comparisons and to assess the changes. Innovative AI-based solutions may be developed to characterise and detect the changes, subject to the validation of human experts.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop new digitisation approaches enabling an unprecedented capability to monitor the evolution over time of the status of heritage objects.</p><p><strong>Interacting with, cross-mixing and re-mixing different data types</strong></p><p>Mixing and integrating different media and media types in effective ways can expand insight capabilities, and lead to new knowledge generation. Projects funded under this topic should develop innovative tools and methods that give the ECCCH ground-breaking capabilities in this area.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should explore how different media can be combined, using both the space and time axes, and how the creative processes involved can be supported. Such new methods will require studying new interaction modes, enabling the navigation over different media types and spaces (2D, 3D, text, ?), and creating a common cross-media interaction language. Users should easily be able to use multiple media in a coordinated manner, for instance for the visual presentation and analysis of heritage objects (e.g. interconnecting 3D and text to tell the story of an artwork, intermixing the navigation of a 3D space and panoramic images to present both spatial and surface colour/reflection characteristics in an accurate manner, enabling the navigation of datasets which join 3D scanned external surfaces with computer tomography scanned data of the interior, or using 3D and images in the documentation of restoration). The tools and methods developed should allow the representation of non-static heritage, such as industrial heritage with many complex machines and processes. As an alternative to producing full digital models of complex machinery, which may be excessively expensive, different media may be combined to represent the dynamic essence of such assets with less effort, for instance using 3D models for the static characteristics of a machinery and adding video and sound to enhance the dynamic experience.</p><p>The work produced may be implemented as new specific tools, and/or as extensions to the functional libraries included in the core ECCCH platform.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.</p><p>Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.</p><p>The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should, when appropriate, be interoperable for sharing via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.</p><p>Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.</p><p>The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.</p><p>Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.</p> <p>'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.</p><p>'Dynamic objects, processes and practices' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all sorts of heritage where complex movements are important characteristics, and may include for instance complex assemblies, mechanisms, dance, etc.</p><p>'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.</p>",,"<p>Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[<sup></sup>The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en"">https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en</a>]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.</p><p>The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[<sup></sup>Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? (ECCCH).</p><p>An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[<sup></sup>European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv?nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014</a>]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.</p><p>The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[<sup></sup>See further <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces</a>]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.</p><p>Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:</p><ul><li>The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[<sup></sup>In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.</li><li>The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.</li><li>Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.</li><li>To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.</li><li>The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: <ul><li>digital twins of heritage objects,</li><li>digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,</li><li>digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role.</li> </ul></li><li>The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.</li><li>An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.</li><li>The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.</li><li>The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.</li><li>The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives.</li></ul><p>The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.</p><p>All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:</p><ul><li>All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[<sup></sup>]] and the Open Source Initiative[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://opensource.org/licenses"">https://opensource.org/licenses</a>]].</li><li>If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.</li><li>All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.</li><li>All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'</li></ul><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li>The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.</li></ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Innovative methods are needed to achieve a massive production of semantically enriched digital resources in the context of multidisciplinary research and professional activities.</p><p>To make cultural heritage content findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), and facilitate discoverability, digital objects must be tagged with good quality metadata. This raises several issues that need to be considered in the design and use of the ECCCH, such as metadata models for different application domains, vocabularies and ontological structures, multilingualism, efficient interfaces for accessing and managing metadata and paradata, effective implementation and reuse of existing models for heterogeneous applications, as well as sustainable maintenance of metadata as the real world and its conceptualisations evolve over time.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop and test innovative tools for human-driven acquisition, categorisation and annotation of digital objects (e.g. texts, images, 3D models, sounds or videos) combined with new AI-based approaches, resulting in high-quality content and metadata. Methods building on citizen science like approaches may also be considered. The tools should foster the emergence of new collaborative data curation scenarios within a multidisciplinary and multisectoral framework. They should further support innovative data interlinkage between cultural heritage objects and related actors, enabling a semi-automatic mutual enrichment process where data are completed and enhanced by detecting and integrating related sources of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Embedding scientific and professional value as well as IP and other associated rights throughout the digital content production chain</strong></p><p>With the digital transformation of the cultural heritage area, large amounts of digital resources are emerging. However, a considerable part of this data remains inaccessible in private repositories.</p><p>The ECCCH should support the transition from massive production of raw data related to activities on cultural heritage objects, to semantically rich and collectively produced digital resources (digital commons). In this context, a key to encourage data sharing is the adequate control of who may use the material created and/or curated, and of how it will be used.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop innovative tools and methods to turn the massive digitisation effort into an opportunity to record and share not only the digital resources (with basic metadata), but also the methods and processes that led to their creation (such as human skills, technological and cognitive processes, or scientific protocols). The tools should support cultural heritage researchers and professionals to record the key steps of their activities on cultural heritage objects, ranging from the historical knowledge to the conservation, restoration and dissemination areas. The tools should produce data chains able to represent the complex workflows - often composed of combinations of individual skills and collective decisions - that constitute the creation of digital resources, as well as their progressive enrichment, transformation and re-use. This information should be linked to any data type/data element. The data chains should also embed information for managing ownership and property rights, use rights, and effective re-use of digital resources, in order to enable and encourage contribution to and use of shared repositories. These tools should, to the extent appropriate, be able to deal correctly with the different cases of unclear or contested IPR that may be encountered. The full production and enrichment chain of digital resources should be encoded, as an implicit mechanism to unveil the value chains of multi-actor collaborative productions. Block chains or other methods may be used, able to encode a stream of changes, modifications and re-uses of the digital objects.</p><p>In order to encode this information, extensions to the ECCCH data model might be needed. If so, these extensions should be designed in cooperation with the ECCCH main consortium.</p><p><strong>Collaboration- and business models based on the multi-actor value chain</strong></p><p>Such encoded value chains should enable innovative business models in collaboration with for instance cultural and creative industries. For this use, projects funded under this topic should introduce and experiment with collaboration- and business models for the data objects stored in the ECCCH, as well as the required web-based infrastructure to allow commercial collaborations. Such actions should be subject to the explicit authorisation of the owner institutions, and revenues shared with those institutions, based on the IPR information from the data value chains.</p><p>Particularly in the context of sharing and re-use of digital cultural resources, the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as the European Open Science Cloud, might be valuable resources. Developments under these initiatives should be taken into account, as appropriate, in order to explore potential synergies and ensure complementarity.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions.

Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics.

They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.</p><p>The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[<sup></sup>Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? (ECCCH).</p><p>An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[<sup></sup>European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv?nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014</a>]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.</p><p>The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[<sup></sup>See further <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces</a>]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.</p><p>Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:</p><ul><li>The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[<sup></sup>In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.</li><li>The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.</li><li>Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.</li><li>To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.</li><li>The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: <ul><li>digital twins of heritage objects,</li><li>digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,</li><li>digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role.</li> </ul></li><li>The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.</li><li>An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.</li><li>The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.</li><li>The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.</li><li>The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives.</li></ul><p>The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.</p><p>All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:</p><ul><li>All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[<sup></sup>]] and the Open Source Initiative[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://opensource.org/licenses"">https://opensource.org/licenses</a>]].</li><li>If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.</li><li>All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.</li><li>All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'</li></ul><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li>The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.</li></ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Creating, sharing and re-using interactive content</li><li>Analysing, designing and testing interactions with visitors</li></ul><p><strong>Creating, sharing and re-using interactive content</strong></p><p>Cultural heritage institutions regularly produce interactive content; for visitors to facilitate the comprehension of the exhibits on display, to entertain them or for research purposes. The platform used to deploy the content may be a simple interactive presentation device (e.g. a PC, a tablet or a mobile app) or more sophisticated immersive devices (large screens, VR rooms, head-mounted displays, specific interaction languages and related devices, etc.).</p><p>The common practice in creating interactive content at cultural heritage institutions is single theme - single institution - no cooperation. This approach makes production costs high, often prohibitively high, since the content is designed from scratch and presented only to a limited audience.</p><p>The challenge is to popularise and democratise the production and use of interactive content for cultural heritage. Innovation based on the ECCCH should make this possible.</p><p>The tools and methods developed should include an easy-to-use authoring system, designed for a community of users which may not be able to master fully-fledged commercial authoring systems. Resources should be developed to facilitate the creation of content and the adoption of a cooperative approach that enables the reuse of components and previous productions. The tools developed should be capable of supporting the entire value chain, including for instance freelancers and small companies, educational institutions, non-profits, etc.</p><p>The tools should support creation of multimedia content on top of basic components by using digital data in the ECCCH and as appropriate from other platforms, such as the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. Using existing components should reduce the digitisation costs of interactive media productions, since a considerable part of the required models and images will already be available.</p><p>The tools should allow re-using portions of content contributed to the ECCCH by other partners. The ECCCH support for explicit tracking of data (re-)use will be key. Data on provenance and reuse of the digital assets should be acknowledged and maintained.</p><p>The tools should also offer the capability to adapt the presentation to more sophisticated contexts, such as non-immersive systems mixing 3D models with high quality visual interfaces and metadata and videos, virtual reality settings providing a strong immersive experience, or virtual worlds/metaverse environments.</p><p>Produced content should be deployable seamlessly on interactive kiosks in exhibition spaces and on web-based platforms, allowing to break the physical walls of the institution and widening the potential audience. Its metadata should allow the produced content to be shared also on other European platforms and data spaces.</p><p><strong>Analysing, designing and testing interactions with visitors</strong></p><p>A common task in cultural heritage is to evaluate if the design of an exhibition - in a real or digital space - is functional and sufficiently impactful and meaningful for the audience. Common queries may include how people move around, which specific content they pay attention to, if they are able to appreciate the exhibits in a proper manner, which areas are most crowded, which points are of more or less interest, etc.</p><p>Also, designing an exhibition is a complex task encompassing many activities related to the 3D space and visitors' perceptions, such as subdivisions of the exposition space, planning the visiting path, distribution of the exhibits and of didactic materials, lighting setup, etc.</p><p>A 3D representation of the exposition space is a basic resource for both types of actions. While architectural CAD tools may in some cases provide support, these are often prohibitively complex and do not correspond well to the needs of the cultural heritage sector.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods for designing and providing simulated and real data mapping over an exposition. Focus should be on the specific needs of cultural heritage professionals, and on the ease of use.</p><p>The tools should be capable of generating preliminary assessments based on digital mock-ups, and assessments based on real physical spaces. Digital mock-ups of an exposition space could be navigated with interactive or virtual reality equipment, while specific equipment would be needed to gather data on users' navigation and interaction with a real physical space.</p><p>The tools should also allow to design an exposition space, introducing separations, openings and pedestals etc. which allow creating a planned path, and smaller spaces inside larger physical exposition spaces, positioning the exhibits and setting a proper illumination.</p><p>The tools should support collaborative work and sharing of resources and results through the ECCCH.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Supporting the study of cultural heritage objects</li><li>Supporting conservation and restoration works</li></ul><p><strong>Supporting the study of cultural heritage objects</strong></p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods which build on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH to allow cultural heritage professionals and researchers to structure, encode, store and analyse all knowledge needed for the study of a cultural heritage object such as artworks, prints, drawings, etc. Such combined use of multiple types of digital visual and other data available on the ECCCH could revolutionise current methodologies in research, documentation and didactics related to the study of cultural heritage objects. The tools would enable visualisation and measurement, support analysis and documentation of the reasoning process (e.g. via annotations or metadata), and build on highly accurate digital representations of the object (2D, 3D, 4D) stored in the ECCCH. The tools should allow to access, interlink, enhance, enrich and archive all necessary knowledge. Search-by-similarity queries should be possible over the ECCCH, based on innovative AI solutions.</p><p>The focus is not only on documenting and archiving multiple heterogeneous documents, but also on identifying, storing and visualising connections among those assets. The digital twin of the cultural heritage object should be a spatial index for structuring and presenting all this knowledge. A cooperative approach should be enabled, with full control of who can access what.</p><p><strong>Supporting conservation and restoration works</strong></p><p>In the cultural heritage field, many different types of data are typically used to describe and monitor the condition of objects for conservation and restoration purposes, such as survey data, scientific imaging, reports, maps of degradation, photographic collections, historical archives, material sample analyses, etc. Many different professional disciplines are involved in data collection, processing and analysis (e.g. art history, architecture, conservation, materials science and engineering). Data collection, processing and analysis is an extremely complex task, performed both before and during restoration/conservation works.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods to collect, manage and use data - with associated knowledge - for conservation and restoration purposes. These tools should build on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH and enable users to structure, encode, store, and analyse all resources needed for conservation assessment, restoration planning, and for documentation of restoration results, within a well-defined and dynamic collaborative framework.</p><p>To cater to the needs of the wide range of professionals involved, the tools should address at least:</p><ul><li>Capture and management of information about material objects (including static and dynamic sensor networks), ensuring continuously updated digital twins in the ECCCH.</li><li>Characterisation of the physical state of artefacts through analysis of material samples, scientific imaging, simulation of behaviours, etc.</li><li>Efficient digital tools to assist users in analysis, diagnosis, and decision making.</li><li>Evaluation and validation of documentation (including examination of diagnostic studies), to establish reproducible protocols for other (future) conservation and restoration efforts.</li><li>Monitoring and archiving the conservation/restoration process over time with a long-term perspective, to prevent unnecessary degradation and plan for future restoration activities.</li></ul><p>AI based methods have the potential to play a key role in developing improved methods for solving research questions or gaining insights about data, such as categorisation, segmentation, recognition, analysis, and understanding. The goal should be to semi-automate work-intensive activities that are common in conservation and restoration.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.</p><p>Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.</p><p>The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.</p><p>Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.</p><p>The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.</p><p>Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.</p> <p>'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.</p><p>'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.</p>",,"<p>Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people.

Sub-criteria are aspects that the experts will consider in the assessment of that criterion. A scoring system from 0 to 5 will be used to evaluate each proposal with respect to each evaluation criterion, using the following definitions for the scores:</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Eligibilty Checks</h3><p>The DUT Call Secretariat will verify the eligibility of the pre-proposals/full-proposals according to the transnational eligibility criteria described in the call text. The participating Funding Agencies will perform a check for compliance according to their funding rules. Both transnational and Funding Agencies' eligibility criteria must be met in order for a proposal to be declared eligible at either stage. In the case a Co-applicant(s) is (are) not eligible, the proposal may still be eligible if and when the eligibility criteria are met by the proposal without this (these) partner(s). If a proposal is 'eligible?, this does not mean that it will be awarded funding, only that the proposal will be admitted to the evaluation procedure.</p><h3>Pre-proposal stage (stage 1)</h3><p>The pre-proposals declared to be eligible according to the transnational and national/regional criteria will be assessed by an Expert Panel. The Panel will consist of recognised international experts in relevant fields, academics as well as practitioners and innovators, who can assess the scientific as well as the innovative and practical value of the pre-proposals. The Panel will be appointed by the Funding Agencies. No external referees or reviewers will be part of the assessment at this stage.</p><p>The Expert Panel will assess the pre-proposals using the evaluation criteria described above. Each pre-proposal will be assessed by at least three Expert Panel members. The Expert Panel will meet to discuss all pre-proposals, to produce an assessment report for each pre-proposal and ranking lists to advise the Funding Agencies responsible for the selection of pre-proposals.</p><p>The outcome of the Expert Panel's work will consist of six ranking lists, each corresponding to one specific TP and one specific R&amp;I approach ( Research-oriented approach (ROA) or Innovation-oriented approach (IOA)) resulting in six ranking lists.</p><p><strong>Selection of the pre-proposals invited to the second stage</strong></p><p>The decision for the invitation to submit a full-proposal in the second stage will be conjointly taken by the participating Funding Agencies (acting as a Call Steering Committee) and will be based on these six ranking lists and the following other criteria that will be used to arbitrate between the ranking lists.</p><p>These criteria will aim to ensure that:</p><ol><li><span></span>the invited pre-proposals represent national/regional funding requests that do not exceed four times (three times for Finland, Switzerland and international partners) the available national/regional budget of each Funding Agency;</li><li><span></span>a maximum of countries participating in the Call are represented in the proposals accepted in the second stage;</li><li><span></span>a good representation (in terms of the number of proposals) of the three TPs and of both types of R&amp;I approaches will be included at the second stage.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Invited consortia will then have the opportunity to elaborate their ideas to full-proposals (second stage). It is possible that invited consortia will be allowed explicitly by the DUT Call Secretariat to integrate, in their full-proposal, additional partners from specific countries, if these countries are under-represented in the proposals invited to the second stage. However, this possibility does not invalidate the consistency requirements between pre-proposal and proposal. All consortia will be provided with an overall assessment of the quality of their pre-proposals.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Full-proposal stage (stage 2)</h3><p>Full-proposals deemed eligible according to the transnational and national/regional criteria will be assessed by an international Expert Panel, as in the first stage.&nbsp;Each full-proposal will be evaluated by at least four independent experts.</p><p>The Expert Panel will meet to discuss all proposals, to produce an assessment report for each full-proposal and ranking lists of full-proposals recommended to be considered for funding to the Funding Agencies. The outcome of the Expert Panel will be six ranking lists, as in stage 1, each ranking list corresponding to a specific Transition Pathway and a specific R&amp;I approach (ROA or IOA).</p><p><strong>Decision for funding</strong></p><p>Based on the ranking lists made by the Expert Panel, the Funding Agencies meeting in a Call Steering Committee (CSC) will jointly decide which projects will be recommended for funding. The final formal funding decision will be taken by each Funding Agency afterward, following its national/regional procedure. Taking into account the available budgets of the Funding Agencies, this CSC recommendation will be based on the identification of the optimal choice of projects to be funded, arbitrating between projects from different ranking lists, and also between any projects equally ranked within the same ranking list , according to the following objectives:</p><ol><li><span></span>optimising both the total number of projects funded and the total number of participating countries/regions involved in these projects;</li><li><span></span>ensuring both a good representation (in terms of the number of projects) and not too dissimilar success rates between the three TPs and between the two R&amp;I approaches;</li><li><span></span>ensuring that the EC co-funding will be used as efficiently as possible but also distributed as fairly as possible among the participating countries eligible for EC co-funding.</li></ol><p>A written statement on the evaluation of each full-proposal will be sent by the Call Secretariat to the Main Applicants. The Call Secretariat will inform the Main Applicants of projects that have been recommended for funding on the subsequent contracting procedure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Right to object a decision, redress procedure</h3><p>Applicants will have no possibility to rebut and appeal against, at a transnational level, the Expert Panel's evaluation or the decision taken by the Call Steering Committee. However, the Call does not preclude rules and legal frameworks that prevail at national/regional level. Therefore, even though the objection on a transnational level is not possible, it may be possible on a national level, depending on the national/regional legal framework. If the decision were to be challenged by a specific pa, it will be dealt by the concerned Funding Agency at the national/regional level according to its applicable domestic law on the matter. The result of the redress procedure is not call-wide.</p>",<ol><li><span></span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://dutpartnership.eu/"">Partnership website</a></li><li><span></span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://dutpartnership.eu/dut-call-2024/"">Call website</a></li><li><span></span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://dut-call-2024.b2match.io/"">Matchmaking</a></li><li><span></span><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://dut-call-2024.b2match.io/page-961"">DUT Call 2024 Info Day 1 (online)</a>: 10 September 2024 10:00 - 13:00 CET</li></ol>,

Current long-term forest monitoring networks provide important information on the impact of climate change on forests. Still, most monitoring networks are not particularly focused on assessing climate change impacts. With this call, the aim is thus to increase the potential of existing forest monitoring sites - especially but not inclusively ICP Forests, ICOS or LTER sites (i.e., sites which already provide a basic set of monitoring data) to link the ground-based information with remote sensing to better assess the impact of climate and climatic extremes on trees and forests.

It is one of the Common European Data Spaces envisioned by the EU Data Strategy and works closely with the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC), especially on cross-sectorial aspects such as minimal interoperability.&nbsp;</p><p>The pilots will provide feedback from practice as more firm guidance is put into regulatory instruments, such as requirements for procurement, operation, and reporting, starting from a baseline of high-value datasets to add value by using data from different domains and models. This initiative aims to foster innovation towards a more resilient Europe, supporting local businesses and ecosystems, and emphasising ethical considerations and AI-enabled local solutions, thereby enhancing the conditions for citizens and communities across Europe.</p><h2><u>Who Can Apply</u></h2><p>The pilot call is specifically designed for local public administrations in the EU and Digital Europe Programme (DEP) Associated countries and partners working with them (e.g., companies, civil society organisations, academia). The consortia must be capable of executing a cross-sectorial and cross-border pilot activity, and co-finance at least 50% of the pilot activity.</p><h2><u>Consortia Eligibility Criteria</u></h2><ol><li><span></span>Eligible consortia must consist of at least two local or regional public administrations from different EU member states and/or DEP Associated countries, promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and dealing with the European Green Deal objectives.</li><li><span></span>The local administrations can also involve other eligible parties working with them (e.g., companies, academia, civil society organisations and others).&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>The pilot consortium members are subject to restrictions due to security reasons. Entities must not be controlled by an ineligible country. If there is a risk for such case, entities will be offered an opportunity to provide a guarantee.</li><li><span></span>All entities (except entities that are validated as public bodies by the EU countries) have to fill in and submit an Ownership Control Declaration (OCD). OCD must be self-declared at proposal time, and if the pilot is awarded, the official OCD must be provided within 14 days from the notification date. If a chosen pilot consortium member is found, after assessment, to be controlled by a partner from a non-EU country, they will need to present a guarantee that will be assessed to allow or exclude participation in the pilot project. If a partner is found to be controlled by a DEP-associated country, they will also have to prepare a guarantee that will need to be assessed to allow or not allow their participation in the pilot.</li></ol><h2><u>Scope</u></h2><p>The pilot consortia must create new data services from the data sharing across at least two areas specified below, but can also include other European Green Deal domains:</p><ol><li><span></span>predictive traffic management/sustainable mobility planning, establishing also synergies with the mobility data space and making use of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators, where appropriate;&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>data-services related to weather, climate and extreme weather events to facilitate risk prevention, disaster resilience as well as climate change adaptation;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>management of energy flows in a city/community specific context and in conjunction with other sectors;&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>zero pollution actions (e.g., air, water, soil pollution or waste);</li><li><span></span>and any other domain falling under the New European Bauhaus initiative (urban design, building management, public services, nature-based solutions, amongst others.</li></ol><h2><u>Available funding and Co-Financing</u></h2><p>Each pilot is planned to be funded with 1 to 1? million euros by EU contribution to share amongst the consortium members of the pilot. If justified, this can also be less than 1 million euro. The funding should be balanced proportionally amongst the pilot sites, and one partner can receive a maximum of 1 million euro as grant (this also applies when applying for more than one pilot or in following open call rounds). The total EU contribution for the DS4SSCC-DEP pilots is 15.3 million euros, which is planned to be distributed to around 12 chosen pilot consortiums.</p><p>The financial criteria for applicants involves a co-funding model. Applicants are expected to bear at least 50% of the project costs, as direct co-financing. This means that for any pilot proposed, the grant will cover only up to half of the total expenses. Applicants must directly indicate the co-financing as a dedicated cost in the budget for the pilot and demonstrate their capacity to provide it through their own resources. To be eligible, co-financing cannot include in-kind resources not explicitly monetized in the pilot budget, and all activities must observe relevant regulation, including state-aid rules and risks of double funding. As normally, all costs need to be actual, incurred during the pilot period time-frame and have to be auditable.</p><p>This approach ensures shared investment and commitment from both the funding body (EU) and the applicants, aligning with the principles of partnership and joint responsibility. The model is designed to encourage meaningful participation and investment in the project, ensuring that the applicants are equally invested in the success and sustainability of their initiatives. It's crucial for applicants to clearly articulate their funding strategy and show their ability to meet these financial requirements in their application.</p><p>The piloting consortium is expected to receive 50% of the total grant at the start, upon signing of the grant agreement, and the remaining 50% will be paid out in two instalments against actual performance, evaluated during midterm and final reporting period.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information about the Financial Framework, please refer to the Call for Pilots Manual at <u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ds4sscc.eu/cfp-two"">https://ds4sscc.eu/cfp-two</a></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>Additional information</h1><p>We strongly recommend participants to get acquainted with the preparatory action and the established DS4SSCC data space blueprint (<u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://inventory.ds4sscc.eu/"">https://inventory.ds4sscc.eu/</a></u>), as it serves as the foundation for proposed solutions and describes the specific requirements that pilots need to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>We invite applicants to be part of the Stakeholder Forum to engage and network with like-minded organisations aiming to realise the objectives for Data Space for Smart Communities.

Among the pre-proposals in Group B, proposals will be selected to Step 2, taking into account the ranking list, the representativeness of all FPOs, the participation in the ECR modality and the funding ratio limits. Pre-proposals in Group C will be dismissed for their low classification.</p><p>Consortium Coordinators will be informed of the outcomes by the CS and, if appropriate, invited to submit a full proposal.</p><p><strong><u>Step 2 (Full proposal stage)</u></strong></p><p>After the submission deadline for full proposals, the submitted full proposals will be checked to ensure that they meet the formal call criteria and have not changed substantially from the respective pre-proposals. Full proposals not meeting the formal conditions will be rejected without further review.</p><p>As in Step 1, each full proposal will be reviewed by three members of the EP based on three criteria - 'Excellence', 'Impact' and 'Quality and Efficiency of Implementation'. The EP members will assess the full proposals in advance of the EP meeting and prepare individual evaluation reports. In case of a missing expertise in the EP for some full proposals, the CS will identify and mobilize external experts to obtain three individual evaluation reports.</p><p>The evaluation results for each full proposal will then be presented by the rapporteur during an EP meeting and discussed by the Panel members. The EP meeting will complete the evaluation procedure by agreeing on the final individual score for each criterion, and the overall score for each proposal. Due to the large number of proposals evaluated, the EP could decide to focus on those proposals that report divergent scores from the evaluators. Any proposal where there is a consensus between the evaluators on any of the three criteria being below the threshold (i.e., 3 out of 5 in each criterion) may not be discussed and ranked by the EP (regardless if there is divergence or not in other scores). The overall threshold on the final score is 10/15: no project with a lower score will be funded.</p><p>The decisions of the EP should be taken collectively, preferably by consensus or by simple majority of the panel members, in case consensus cannot be reached. The rapporteur will produce a common consensus report on behalf of the EP for each full proposal, which will be transmitted to the applicants.</p><p>A ranking list of proposals will be produced based on the final scores, following the same methodology as in Step 1. The final ranking list will be forwarded to the CSC, which will meet to decide on the projects to be recommended for funding by FPOs. For this decision, the CSC will strictly follow the order of the ranking list from the EP until the available funding is exhausted.</p><p>The applicants will be informed about the final outcome of the call.</p>","<p>Applicants should refer to the details of the Call Announcement, which can be downloaded from the 2024 JTC webpage on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.water4all-partnership.eu/"">Water4All Partnership website</a>.</p><p>The Call Announcement highlights the aim, expected approach and topics of the call.

Proposal submission and funding announcement</strong></p><p>Proposals must be submitted at FastTrackCall2024@eitrawmaterials.eu no later than Friday 18 October, 2024 at 13:00 CET. Evaluation will commence after monthly cut-offs (19 August eob, 19 September eob) during the call period, and the outcomes of the evaluation will be communicated to the Partners within two weeks after the respective cut-off. Projects can start on or after 1 September, 1 October or 1 November 2024, respectively. All costs must be incurred, and all activities must be completed by 31 December 2025.</p><p>The level of any available pre-financing of a project will be announced together with the notification of acceptance of the project. Questions can be directed to Compliance@eitrawmaterials.eu.</p><p><strong>6. Appeal and redress procedure</strong></p><p>Upon reception of the feedback, the applicant may wish to lodge a request for redress, if there is a concern that there might have been a shortcoming in the way a proposal was evaluated, or if the results of the eligibility checks are incorrect. The redress procedure is not meant to call into question the judgement made by the evaluators. It will consider only procedural shortcomings and factual errors.</p><p>Requests for redress should be raised within one month of the reception of the evaluation feedback sent by EIT RawMaterials, and should be sent to Compliance@eitrawmaterials.eu. Requests must:</p><p>? be related to the evaluation process, or eligibility checks;</p><p>? include a clear description of the grounds for the complaint;</p><p>? be received within the time limit specified above.</p><p>An initial reply will be sent to complainants no later than two weeks after the deadline for redress requests. This initial reply will indicate when a definitive reply will be provided. A redress committee of EIT RawMaterials may be convened to examine the evaluation process for the case under consideration. The committee's role is to ensure a coherent interpretation of requests, and equal treatment of applicants. The redress committee itself, however, does not re-evaluate the proposal. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the committee may review the evaluation report and the individual comments made by the evaluators. Following its review, the committee will recommend a course of action to the EIT RawMaterials Management. If there is clear evidence of a shortcoming that could affect the funding decision, it is possible that all or part of the proposal may be re-evaluated. Unless there is clear evidence of a shortcoming there will be no follow-up or re-evaluation. The Executive Board of EIT RawMaterials will be informed of any redress procedures in due course.</p><p>Please note:</p><p>? This procedure is concerned with the evaluation and/or eligibility checking process.</p><p>? The committee will not call into question the judgment of the individual evaluators, whose qualifications have been already assessed and validated.</p><p>? A re-evaluation will only be carried out if there is evidence of a shortcoming that affects the quality assessment of a proposal. This means e.g. that a problem relating to one evaluation criterion will not lead to a re-evaluation if a proposal has failed anyway on the other criteria.</p>",<p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eitrawmaterials.eu/fast-track-call-2024/"">FAST TRACK 2024: Call for Ongoing EIT RawMaterials Projects - EIT RawMaterials</a></p>,3 months

This pool of experts includes experts in digitalisation and green engineering who accompany applicants by coaching and mentoring them. This enables Partners to implement the coaching and mentoring services (CMS) by supporting companies in the strategic design and implementation of new and innovative digital and green approaches, technologies, business models, and ensuring a successful implementation. The pool of experts is expected to grow steadily during the project lifetime.</p><p>The applicant SME, start-ups, VSB may contact one or more experts either from the list available on the submission platform: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://clustersubmissionplatform.eu/service-providers-resist/"">https://clustersubmissionplatform.eu/service-providers-resist/</a>and the ECCP or propose an expert outside the list and invite them to submit an offer for the respective coaching and mentoring service, and finally selects one expert. If the selected expert is not an expert listed in the pool, he can join the pool of experts to expand the range of offered services to SMEs in the Mobility-Transport-Automotive within the RESIST project. </p><p>Experts interested in joining the pool of experts have the option to apply for the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://clustersubmissionplatform.eu/eurocluster_post/resist-service-providers-call/"">Open Call for expression of interest for service providers</a> either before or after the contract is signed. Experts can apply throughout the duration of the RESIST project until 10/10/2024 00:00. This step is not obligatory but provides an opportunity for experts to express their interest in participating. Participating in a pool of experts offers the expert two key advantages:</p><p>Collaboration and knowledge exchange: By being part of the pool, the expert can collaborate with other skilled professionals, fostering a learning environment and leading to the development of new ideas and approaches.</p><p>Increased visibility and opportunities: Joining the pool exposes the expert to a larger audience of potential beneficiaries, creating more opportunities to work on projects or provide services to a diverse range of clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The applicants receive financial support in the form of grants through reimbursement of actual cost for the CMS from the consortium.

Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations.</p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?</strong></p><p>When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, applicant organisations can choose one of the following roles:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Support role</u></strong> - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, mediation between them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;</li><li><strong><u>Host role</u></strong> - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the participant during all the phases as appropriate</li></ul><p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p><p>The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process, involving three main stages: submission of application, assessment and award.</p><p>The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time) during the programming period, to the Executive Agency, which is the sole implementing body for this action. The applications will be evaluated at set intervals, according to an annual timetable, which is aligned to the timetable of the Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.</p><p>Applications will be assessed against eligibility, selection, exclusion and award criteria (for more information on the selection and exclusion criteria, see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may carry out periodical reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until the end of the last project in which the organisation is involved.</p><p>In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia, profiles of all organisations holding this Quality Label are published in a database of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify potential partners, partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal can be used.</p><p>Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations gain access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to advertise activities. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for potential partners and participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in the Quality Label application form.</p><p><strong>APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF HOSTING ORGANISATION - THE SIMPLIFIED HOST PROCEDURE</strong></p><p>An organisation established in a programme country that applies for support role may also apply for host role on behalf of its branches located in non programme countries with which it shares the same legal personality (simplified hosting procedure). This procedure is designed to help larger organisations, with several branches located in different countries.</p><p>The applicant supporting organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of activities offered by simplified hosting organisation(s) on behalf of which it is applying.</p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS?</strong></p><p>The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. Participating organisations must respect the following principles and standards:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Equal opportunities and non-discrimination</u></strong>. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective way, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project context. In order to promote inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer, with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</li><li><u><strong>Avoidance of job substitution</strong>.</u> Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.</li><li><strong><u>Avoidance of harmful activities</u></strong>. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child (https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_guidelines_rights_of_child_0.pdf)</li><li><strong><u>Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities</u></strong>. The volunteering tasks should enable participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Particular attention will be given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers' interaction with local humanitarian actors, the hosting community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised for volunteers, through validation of learning outcomes.</li><li><strong><u>Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements</u></strong>. Safe and decent living and working conditions must be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.</li><li><strong><u>'no profit?</u></strong>. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore, volunteering should cover the participants' expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.</li></ul><p><strong>TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORGANISATIONS HOLDING A QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING</strong></p><p>In addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles, organisations implementing humanitarian aid volunteering projects must carry out specific tasks and responsibilities in order to ensure high quality activities. When applying for a Quality Label, organisations must be able to demonstrate their capacity to perform the tasks and take up responsibilities relevant to the role they are applying for, as outlined in the requirements below. This list is not comprehensive and, in some cases, the set of tasks and responsibilities may overlap between host and support organisations, without prejudice to the overall quality of the

MSCA Doctoral Networks are indeed open to the participation of organisations from third countries, in view of fostering strategic international partnerships for the training and exchange of researchers.</p><p>These doctoral programmes will respond to well-identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, expose the researchers to the academic and non-academic sectors, and offer training in research-related, as well as transferable skills and competences relevant for innovation and long-term employability (e.g. entrepreneurship, commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication). Proposals for doctoral networks can reflect existing or planned research partnerships among the participating organisations.</p><p>The selection procedure for doctoral candidates must be open, transparent and merit-based, in line with the Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers. The vacancy notice (to be widely advertised internationally, including on the EURAXESS website) must mention if the published rates include all employer and employee's taxes and contributions. If possible, the gross salary (net salary + employee's taxes and contributions) should be published.</p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks are encouraged to lead to Industrial or Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Industrial Doctorates</em></p><p>Through Industrial Doctorates, doctoral candidates will step outside academia and develop skills in industry and business by being jointly supervised by academic and non-academic organisations, both of which can be established in the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Joint Doctorates</em></p><p>Joint Doctorates represent a highly integrated type of international, inter-sectoral and multi/interdisciplinary collaboration in doctoral training. They lead to the delivery of joint, double or multiple doctoral degrees recognised in at least one EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country.</p><p><em>Supervisory Board</em></p><p>Each MSCA Doctoral Network should have a clearly identified supervisory board co-ordinating network-wide training, research and in particular supervision activities in line with the Guidelines for MSCA supervision, while establishing continuous communication and exchange of best practice among the participating organisations to maximise the benefits of the partnership.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>MSCA Doctoral Networks should exploit complementarities between participating organisations and foster sharing of knowledge and networking activities for example through the organisation of workshops and conferences. Proposed training activities should respond to well identified needs in various R&amp;I areas, with appropriate references to inter- and multidisciplinary fields and follow the EU Principles for Innovative Doctoral Training. They should be primarily focused on developing new scientific knowledge through original research on personalised projects.</p><p>Inter-sectoral secondments of researchers to other participating organisations, including in third countries, are encouraged when relevant, feasible and beneficial for the researchers and in line with the project objectives. This will increase the employability of the researchers outside academia.</p><p>Doctoral Networks should develop substantial training modules, including digital ones, addressing key transferable skills and competences common to all fields and fostering the culture of Open Science, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as good scientific conduct such as research integrity. In particular, Doctoral Networks should adequately prepare doctoral candidates for increased research collaboration and information-sharing made possible by new (digital) technologies (e.g. collaborative tools, opening access to publications and to other research outputs including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Supervision</em></p><p>Particular attention is paid to the quality of supervision and mentoring arrangements as well as career guidance. Joint supervision of the researchers is mandatory for Industrial and Joint Doctorates.</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>A Career Development Plan must be established jointly by the supervisor and each recruited doctoral candidate. In case of joint supervision, such a plan should be established involving all supervisors. In addition to research objectives, this plan comprises the researcher's training and career needs, including training on transferable skills, teaching, planning for publications and participation in conferences and events aiming at opening science and research to citizens.

These facilities will capitalise on the previous 5G-PPP infrastructure (ICT-17) and vertical trial projects (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://5g-ppp.eu/5g-ppp-phase-3-3-projects/"">ICT-19</a>) by drawing analogies and reusing the platform components as much as possible. Given that IMAGINE-B5G partners have collectively participated in all the previous ICT-17 and ICT-19 projects, this will ensure a successful implementation of SNS-D-01-01 goals and expected outcomes.</p><p>Collectively, the facilities will support a set of <strong>B5G applications</strong> (including immersive <strong>holographic</strong>, <strong>haptic and</strong><strong>telepresence</strong> communications for enhanced human interaction) enabled by the integration of <strong>advanced 5G technologies</strong>, including 5G positioning, zero-touch solutions, network capability exposure, edge computing, advanced IoT solutions, network data analytics, millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies, advanced combinations of private and public networks, and open architectures. The infrastructure of the facilities in Norway, Spain and Portugal will be based on industry equipment and components. The French facility will bring a completely <strong>open-source E2E 5G implementation. </strong>The different facilities of IMAGINE-B5G will have diverse set of advanced 5G technologies. As such <strong>the project will implement facility federation</strong> with easy-to-use portal and APIs to enable vertical trials to seamlessly leverage resources regardless of the actual facility providing them. The architectures will ensure the accessibility and openness as well as forward compatibility of the facility infrastructure using an open framework through portal and open APIs to provide access across the multiple interworking facility sites.</p><p>The functionalities built into the IMAGINE-B5G platform will enable the project to <strong>identify, monitor and validate not only use case specific KPIs </strong>(Key Performance Indicators), <strong>but also KVIs </strong>(Key societal Value Indicators), at different levels (application, management/network and societal), demonstrating the value of the advanced 5G solutions and ultimately fostering the widespread adoption of these technologies. A special focus will be on providing <strong>security testing across all facilities</strong> to allow for discovery of vulnerabilities. This will be carried out by employing a common framework which will support the demonstration and evaluation of a range of advanced KPIs and KVIs. </p><p>IMAGINE-B5G has the ambition of enhancing collaboration on integration and validation of the B5G platform, addressing the <strong>technical, business, economic, and societal challenges</strong> that will arise along the way. In addition to the technological advances, the project will investigate the business interactions of the stakeholders that are involved in the different vertical ecosystems and will deliver <strong>novel business models</strong> that unlock new revenue streams and establish viable vertical markets. Beyond the vertical sector business models, IMAGINE-B5G will develop the platform business models and the necessary economic mechanisms that will guarantee the <strong>sustainable operation</strong> of the facilities during SNS programme, considering also the potential of the platform commercialization.</p><p>IMAGINE-B5G has set out a comprehensive plan to on-board the third parties (e.g., SMEs, industry, and researchers) via open-calls (40% of the project budget will be devoted for open-calls, i.e., 4.44 M?). This includes a 3-phase approach where each phase is associated with a <strong>release of the IMAGINE-B5G platform</strong> and a Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP) <strong>open-call for vertical experiments </strong>through pilots and trials. Note: IMAGINE-B5G targets to allocate at least 50% of the open-call budget to the SMEs, scaleups and start-ups. To this end, the open calls will specifically prioritize projects that will involve SMEs, scaleups and start-ups.</p><p>The third <strong>open-call (OC-3)</strong> will be published in October 2024 and will remain open for two months, with an expected start date of projects in March 2025. In the third open-call, third parties are invited to present proposals in one of the following tracks: </p><p>(i)To test and validate their novel vertical applications through pilots and trials on the IMAGINE-B5G facilities.</p><p><strong>Deadline of Open Call 3: </strong><sup>2nd</sup> December 2024</p><p><strong>Expected duration of participation:</strong> The selected projects will be given up to 6 months to carry out their experiments.</p><p><strong>Maximum amount of financial support for each third party:</strong> The projects selected can be awarded a maximum budget up to ?60,000 (for one partner). </p><p><strong>Call identifier:</strong> 101096452-OC-3</p><p><strong>Language in which proposal should be submitted:</strong> English </p><p><strong>Web link for further information the official project web site: </strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://imagineb5g.eu/3rd-open-call/"">https://imagineb5g.eu/3rd-open-call/</a></p><p><strong>address for further information: </strong>imagine-b5g-opencall@iteam.upv.es</p><p><strong>Submission and Evaluation Process:</strong></p><p>The evaluation of proposals will be carried out by the IMAGINE-B5G FSTP Evaluation Board, which is composed by a group of internal and external experts to ensure scientific excellence, transparency, and non-conflict of interest. All submitted proposals will be evaluated using criteria similar to Horizon Europe by at least three evaluators one of which will be external. All evaluators will be asked to sign a non-conflict of interest agreement, to ensure selection process independence. The recruitment of the evaluators will also follow an OC process to ensure full transparency. While forming the Evaluation Board, we will pay extra attention to have the board with a broad range of experience on the specific topics addressed by the call. The evaluation criteria have been defined:</p><ol><li><span></span>Excellence (0 to 5 points): Proposals must demonstrate a clear set of objectives aligned with the definition of the IMAGINE-B5G Call and with the general objectives of the project. The experiment should be scientifically and/or technically sound. For vertical experiments, there should be a clear problem statement a solid experiment design, and a good methodology. For platform extensions, the applicant should clearly indicate the usefulness and feasibility of the extensions. The applicant should exhibit prior research/development experience and the necessary qualifications to perform the vertical experiment. The <em>Excellence</em> is evaluated according to the following criteria: <em>(i)</em> Clarity and pertinence of the objectives; <em>(ii)</em> Excellence, innovation, and quality of the objectives and the methodology. Minimum score to pass the evaluation: 3.</li><li><span></span>Impact (0 to 5 points): Proposals must define a clear set of deliverables aligned with the objectives of the call. Proposals must demonstrate adequate impact on the IMAGINE-B5G ecosystem and its contribution to meeting the overall objectives of IMAGINE-B5G project. For scientific impact of vertical experiments, the score reflects the extent to which the broader scientific community can benefit from the proposed solution. For the industrial impact of vertical experiments, the score reflects the potential for exploiting the results of the experiment in commercial solutions. The <em>impact</em> is evaluated according to the following criteria: <em>(i)</em> Strengthening the competitiveness and growth of 6G by deploying a use-case and stimulating innovation/disruption that meet the needs of European and global markets; <em>(ii)</em> Effectiveness of the proposed measures to exploit and disseminate the funded project results, to overall communicate the project, and to manage research data where relevant. Minimum score to pass the evaluation: 3.&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>Implementation (0 to 5 points): Proposals must provide credible evidence that the project delivery team has the necessary skills, resources, infrastructure, and management experience to be able to deliver the project in the timescales and budget specified. The quality and the efficiency of the implementation will be evaluated according to the following criteria: <em>(i)</em> Coherence and effectiveness of the work plan, including appropriateness of the allocation of tasks and resources, justification of resources; <em>(ii)</em> Appropriateness of the skills and experience of the project delivery team. Minimum score to pass the evaluation: 3.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Minimum total score to pass the evaluation: 10.&nbsp;</p><p>Socio-economic and other relevant non-technical aspects will also be considered.&nbsp;</p><p>A number of top-ranked proposals will be selected to achieve the target budget of the call. IMAGINE-B5G targets to allocate at least 50% of the open-call budget to the SMEs, scaleups and start-ups. To reach this target, during the final selection and ranking of the proposals, two different ranking lists will be created: one for SMEs, scaleups and start-ups, and one for all the other projects. The budget then will be distributed to the top ranked projects (starting from the SMEs, scaleups and start-ups list) to the facilities based on the specified number&nbsp;of open call users each facility can support.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure a balanced portfolio covering as many strategic sectors as possible, grants will be awarded to proposals not only in order of ranking but also considering broad coverage of different sectors. The sectors that are not covered by higher ranked proposals can be prioritized given that the proposals for these sectors attain all required thresholds.</p><p>IMAGINE-B5G has shortlisted the following seven verticals: <strong>Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR), media, education, smart agriculture & forestry, eHealth, transportation &amp; logistics, and Industry 4.0</strong>. In this document, we are providing a short description of the desired vertical experiments (alongside the facility that they can be performed) and linked used cases for each of these verticals. It is important to highlight that the use case <u>Improved localization mechanisms for transportation and logistics</u> offered in the Portuguese Facility is identified as the missing use case in the gap analysis performed in IMAGINE-B5G, therefore it will be given the highest priority during the selection of the OC3 projects. However, IMAGINE-B5G projects welcomes any other vertical or different use cases under the specified verticals.&nbsp;</p>",<p>https://imagineb5g.eu/3rd-open-call/</p>,The selected projects will be given up to 6 months to carry out their experiments. Budget per project up to 60k?.

Under this EIT SIA 2021-2027, the EIT and the EIT KICs will raise the bar and create systemic impact in higher education by strengthening innovation ecosystems. This will be achieved through the following: </p><p>? Increasing the entrepreneurial and innovation capacity of higher education institutions across Europe by promoting and supporting institutional change in higher education institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>? Strengthening the integration and contribution of higher education institutions to innovation ecosystems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To realise these ambitions, the EIT and EIT KICs established the EIT Higher Education Institutions (HEI) Initiative. The EIT HEI Initiative plays a crucial role in driving economic and societal transformation. In line with the EIT SIA, it focuses on building innovation and entrepreneurship capacity at the institutional level and fostering the strategic integration of higher education into the wider innovation ecosystem by equipping HEIs with essential knowledge, tools and networks. Its Calls for Proposals incorporate the EIT Knowledge Triangle Model which brings together partners from education, research, and business to collaborate on innovation action plans. This approach fosters systemic change by enabling the co-creation of knowledge and impactful solutions to global challenges, both within individual projects and across the broader portfolio. Central to the EIT HEI Initiative is its commitment to building a dynamic, inclusive community of HEIs and non-HEIs to enhance the role of European higher education in the innovation ecosystem, promoting a more innovative and competitive Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>The Call for Proposals 2024 aims to further enhance the quality and competitiveness of European higher education by funding innovation capacity building projects that will bring about institutional and systemic change. It offers applying consortia the opportunity to shape their own pathway to innovation by selecting activities that address their specific capacity building needs. Selected projects will implement funded actions that, among others, will strengthen staff capacity, establish innovation structures, support technology transfer and business creation activities and foster collaboration between HEIs and business partners across Europe through the establishment of strategic partnerships.&nbsp;</p>",,,"<p>The applicants are required to create an Innovation Vision Action Plan (IVAP) as the core of their proposal. The answers provided by applicants to the questions in the EIT HEI Initiative Application Portal cumulatively generate the IVAP; in other words, the proposal is the IVAP. </p><p>The IVAP will be submitted through the application portal, in two Parts, A and B, according to the following structure:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Part A - Technical information (to be completed online within the Application Portal):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>1. General information&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>2. Applicant information&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>3. Associated Partners&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>4. Domains and Actions&nbsp;</p><p>5. KPIs&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>6.

Section 1: Excellence&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>? Section 2: Impact&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>? Section 3: Quality and Efficiency of Implementation&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Once all the above elements of Part A and Part B are completed and/or uploaded within the application portal, the lead partner (applicant) must download and sign the Declaration of Honour template on behalf of the project consortium and upload it to the portal, before clicking 'submit'. The IVAP should be shaped based on the HEInnovate self-assessment tool, to be performed by each HEI individually or as a group. Applicants should complete the HEInnovate self-assessment as an indication of the current state of the innovation and entrepreneurship capacity of the consortium and the results should be used to inform the choice of funded Actions to be implemented at the corresponding HEIs. The IVAP will provide a clear, step-by-step action plan consisting of work packages, milestones, deliverables, and beneficiaries, as well as other key indicators to track progress and impact. A risk management and intellectual property management approach must also be included. Projects selected for funding will participate in a mandatory face-to-face IVAP Kick Off Workshop in April/May 2025, during which participants will co-learn and collaborate across projects around the core themes of their IVAP.&nbsp;While the EIT HEI Initiative will provide funding and support to selected projects for 25 months of the IVAP, from 1 April 2025 - 30 April 2027, the IVAP will be continued beyond the project funding period to achieve the project's outlined 2030 vision.&nbsp;</p><p>The EIT HEI Initiative projects will be reviewed through a competitive, external and independent evaluation process. To be considered for selection, the applicant/coordinator must submit an application on behalf of the consortium as a response to this call. Applications will be assessed against the eligibility criteria presented in Call for Proposals 2024 document. Applications must be submitted in the EIT HEI Initiative Application Portal by the 12 December 2024, 17.00 CET.&nbsp;</p><p>Successful and unsuccessful applicants will be informed in writing within the week of 3 - 7 March 2025.

Free and open source <strong>software</strong> and <strong>hardware</strong>, open <strong>standards</strong>, open <strong>data & AI</strong>, open <strong>science</strong>, <strong>creative commons</strong> and open <strong>educational resources</strong> are democratising innovation and learning, and are together driving society and industry forward at an unprecedented pace. But it is also obvious that there are major gaps that need to be fixed still. The answer to market failure and dystopian runaway technology lies in <strong>collective action</strong> and <strong>public investment</strong>.</p><p>This is where <strong>NGI Zero Commons Fund</strong> come into play. The goal of this new fund is to help deliver, mature and scale <strong>new internet commons</strong> across the whole technology spectrum, from libre silicon to middleware, from P2P infrastructure to convenient end user applications. We have a <strong>holistic</strong>, <strong>full-stack approach</strong>, simply because there is no other way. If we want to reclaim the public nature of the internet and yield the full benefits from technology as a society, we need to have full coverage ? period.</p><p>Only though enough critical mass of <strong>shared building blocks</strong> and <strong>collective resources</strong> will our governments, businesses and civil society be able to secure their security and long term operational availability. The same approach that empowers individuals to take full control of their digital lives, will also steer towards more fair, innovative economies and societies. So let's make it happen!</p><p>The changes we want to see are vast, and there is much technical debt to resolve as well. We are looking for <strong>troubleshooters</strong> that help society tackle the hard but very very important challenges ahead. Ultimately we believe in the power of the <strong>quadruple helix</strong> ? the collaboration of the public sector, aligned companies, academia and civil society ? to restore the internet (and our economies) back to health. Together we can create a strong and open internet for all, and bring about new paradigms like the European Commissions vision for <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/virtual-worlds-and-web-40-factsheet"">Web 4.0</a> which aim to harness upcoming techologies like <em>virtual and augmented reality</em>, <em>generative AI</em> and <em>intelligent mediators</em> in a responsible way so they may sustainably serve society.</p><p>We need <strong>new ideas</strong> and <strong>disruptive technologies</strong>, while at the same time <strong>evolving</strong> and <strong>growing</strong> existing technologies that are still future-proof.</p><p>Have a look at <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroPET.html"">other</a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroDiscovery.html"">NGI</a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGI0Entrust.html"">Zero </a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroCore.html"">programmes</a> to see the kind of efforts we mean, but don't be afraid to send something completely different if you think you can contribute to the topic ? it really is an open call.</p><p>Project results always become available under a free or open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code or open data to create solutions that fits their own purposes.

The partnership will be firmly anchored within the framework of the European Health Union package<sup>[1]</sup> that aims to improve the EU's capacity in the vital areas of prevention, preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, early warning, and response. In this regard, synergies and close collaboration with the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and other relevant European Commission services need to be ensured.</p><p>The partnership's activities are expected to be key enablers of the EU Global Health Strategy<sup>[2]</sup>, notably its guiding principle 5 to boost global health research and guiding principle 7 to strengthen capacities for prevention, preparedness and response, particularly to expand and strengthen European and global research partnerships including clinical trial networks that can be pivoted to address new and emerging pathogens.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards, and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>The EU offers a valued network of clinical trial sites that have the capacity to implement well-coordinated large-scale multi-country quality trials in different target populations, which are able to smoothly transition to public health interventions relevant for cross-border health threats in response to a public health emergency;</li><li>Relevant EU and national entities, the scientific communities and networks, policymakers and funders enhance their collaboration and coordination for strengthened research on pandemic preparedness and response, forming a strong and structured ecosystem with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;</li><li>Research funders, policymakers, relevant EU and national entities, and the research community recognise and close rapidly relevant research and related infrastructure gaps and break existing silos on pandemic preparedness research and response;</li><li>Healthcare authorities, regulatory authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use the research results to develop evidence-based strategies and policies for pandemic preparedness and response, and deploy good practices to European countries and regions, and beyond whenever relevant;</li><li>The research community at large benefits from and uses an improved comprehensive knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information infrastructures to improve transnational research in the area of pandemic preparedness and response;</li><li>The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised actor for pandemic preparedness research and response, as such substantially contributing to global cooperation and coordination.</li></ul><span>Scope:</span><p>The COVID-19 pandemic uncovered the challenges that European health care systems face in detecting, preventing, combatting and managing outbreaks of infectious diseases in a coordinated manner. It also illustrated the need for stronger preparedness and networks for research and timely clinical trials and observational studies, for more timely availability of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as more appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions and adequate communication strategies in terms of fighting mis/disinformation and fostering appropriate behaviours. Furthermore, it showed how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a fragmented, inefficient research landscape.</p><p>At the same time, the relentless work of the research community that has led to availability of several COVID-19 vaccines in record time highlighted the critical importance of collaborative R&amp;I to respond rapidly to emerging health threats.</p><p>Therefore, transformative investments in research for pandemic preparedness are needed at European level. Stronger collaboration and coordination between European actors, including the appropriate infrastructures and networks, are an important prerequisite for improving EU's pandemic preparedness and stepping up our contribution to global cooperation in this area.</p><p>This should be done through a partnership that promotes:</p><ul><li>improved coordination and cooperation to adjust research and innovation agendas on national and European levels (and contributing globally), as essential part of the pandemic preparedness planning and implementation activities;</li><li>coordination and prioritisation of a comprehensive research response to a health emergency, from basic research for better understanding of pathogens with pandemic potential to the development or adaptation of medical countermeasures, as well as effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and/or public health and social measures (PHSM), and using an integrated One Health approach;</li><li>the consolidation and further development of ever-warm EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, controlled trials and observational studies for public health interventions, such as EU-wide vaccine and treatment trials, PHSM/NPI trials or cohorts;</li><li>the provision of robust and timely scientific evidence to inform sound public health decision-making in response to a public health emergency;</li><li>the use of agreed data standards<sup>[3]</sup> to safely collect, store, link and manage FAIR<sup>[4]</sup> data and to exploit the full potential of the generated data for modelling and in-silico methods for epidemic surveillance, clinical trials and observational studies, among others.</li></ul><p>The partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent, widening the engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.</p><p>The partnership should endorse a pandemic preparedness Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) based on the work of the CSA BE READY and prepare for the management of the research response during a crisis, by strengthening the collaboration between relevant partners and the alignment of related investments. The partnership will consider the impact of environmental, climatic issues and patterns in relation with the emergence and spread of health threats to better understand how these increase the risk for emerging infectious diseases, and how this should be integrated into the research done using a One Health approach.</p><p>The scope of the partnership should encompass:</p><ul><li><strong>basic research</strong> to accelerate the acquisition of knowledge on the biology of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, their transmission and interaction with humans, animals and plants, in particular in view of emerging threats to human health. The initial focus should be on pathogens with high epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU, such as those included in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO), with particular attention to those meeting the criteria identified by HERA<sup>[5]</sup>;</li><li><strong>preclinical research</strong> aimed at better understanding of human diseases caused by pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential and testing of related medical countermeasures;</li><li><strong>clinical research</strong> to support the generation of novel solutions, in particular the development (phase I to phase III) of medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and digital solutions, to prevent or mitigate outbreaks from pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, in line with the mission of HERA and the ACT EU initiative<sup>[6]</sup>;</li><li>a <strong>key feature</strong> should be the consolidation and further development of an <strong>ever-warm network of clinical trial sites</strong><sup>[7]</sup> applying the same quality standards and ensuring a baseline of continuous clinical trial activity across a wide and diverse range of clinical trial sites, to allow for a rapid clinical trial response in case of an epidemic or pandemic. This includes the development of criteria for a clinical trial site to be considered as ever-warm;</li><li>the development, testing and validation of new methods and tools, including those based on artificial intelligence and computer modelling, to improve <strong>surveillance and diagnosis </strong>and control of the spread of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential;</li><li>the conduct of <strong>public health and social sciences and humanities (SSH) research</strong> for the development and robust evaluation of appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions/public health and social measures and effective communication strategies at all phases of a public health emergency;</li><li>the <strong>consolidation and/or development of infrastructures, platforms and networks</strong> necessary for fast and timely start of the response research, capitalising on previous investments and existing infrastructures supporting collaboration, trans-boundary access and provision of services, such as provided by ISIDORe<sup>[8]</sup> or ECRIN<sup>[9]</sup>.</li><li><strong>capacity building</strong> through <strong>networking and training of researchers</strong>, to share knowledge and good practices also with EU and national entities, policymakers and funders.</li></ul><p>It is intended to implement the partnership in two phases. The activities in the first phase should mainly focus on:</p><ul><li>the way clinical trials are set up and conducted in the EU to address public health emergencies, including new approaches such as computer modelling and in-silico clinical trials. <ul><li>this will require coordination mechanisms to support prioritisation of emergency trials, improved mechanisms to identify and rank promising compounds, mobilising EU and Member State funding mechanisms, and measures to help speed up contracting of clinical trial sites during emergencies and in preparedness time. For this purpose, close collaboration with the EMA and its Emergency Task Force, National Competent Authorities, Ethics Committees, and the European Commission should be ensured.</li><li>this includes the consolidation, integration and further expansion of EU-wide network of ever-warm clinical trial sites, building on earlier made investments such as Vaccelerate<sup>[10]</sup>, Ecraid<sup>[11]</sup> and EU RESPONSE<sup>[12]</sup>. It is expected that the partnership will develop a sustainable solution to ensure the long-term viability of adequate European clinical trial networks for a timely public health emergency response, which cover key target populations and have a suitable geographic spread.</li> </ul></li><li>implementing joint calls for transnational proposals to foster transnational research in the other areas in the scope of the partnership.</li><li>developing the roadmaps for the implementation of the remaining activities foreseen by the partnership.</li></ul><p>The second phase of the partnership is expected to build on this first phase, to further develop and consolidate what has been achieved and implement the roadmaps developed for remaining activities as outlined in the scope, with the possibility of expanding to new partners.</p><p>The total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 100 million and subject to the effective implementation of the commitments made by the members of the consortium. The Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.</p><p>The expected duration of the partnership is 7 to 10 years with the first phase having a duration of 2 to 3 years.</p><p><strong>General principles</strong></p><p>As <strong>general principles</strong>, the partnership will:</p><ul><li>promote an inclusive membership and balanced geographic representation, open to third countries and other relevant stakeholders;</li><li>promote data sharing, data standards and data-based digital tools, and align with EU-wide initiatives on <strong>open access and FAIR</strong><sup>[4]</sup><strong> data, artificial intelligence and virtual human twins</strong>;</li><li>pay specific attention to the <strong>gender and sex dimensions</strong>, as well as representativeness of different population groups including young people and vulnerable groups;</li><li>foster the development and use of <strong>trustworthy artificial intelligence</strong><sup>[14]</sup>, in all its three dimensions (lawful, ethical and robust);</li><li>ensure <strong>synergies</strong> and explore <strong>collaborations</strong> with other relevant activities at EU and international level.</li></ul><p>To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with the relevant European Commission services, with other Horizon Europe projects, partnerships (institutionalised and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on 'Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe'<sup>[15]</sup> as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health<sup>[16]</sup>, the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL)<sup>[17]</sup>, the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+)<sup>[18]</sup>, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)<sup>[19]</sup>, InvestEU<sup>[20]</sup>, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF)<sup>[21]</sup> and the Technical Support Instrument (TSI)<sup>[22]</sup>.</p><p>When defining calls for proposals, the partnership needs to consider the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>The partnership should create synergies with the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) currently in its third iteration as Global Health EDCTP3<sup>[23]</sup> Joint Undertaking, that brings together 15 countries from Europe and 25 countries from sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP is already funding adaptive clinical trial networks spanning African and European countries and a Clinical Trials Community Network<sup>[24]</sup> The partnership should also contribute to help achieve the goals of GloPID-R<sup>[25]</sup>, the coalition of research funders that invests in research to improve pandemic preparedness &amp; response.</p><p>The partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration. Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and non-European institutions and experts may be considered.</p><p><strong>Governance</strong></p><p>The partnership's governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should involve key stakeholders and interested parties, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, public health authorities, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations, innovation owners, and relevant EU entities, including the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency.</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>The proposal should pool the necessary cash and in-kind resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes, in order to:</p><ul><li>sustain and further develop the EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, and in particular a network of ever-warm clinical trial sites by running continuous preparedness trials in relevant target populations;</li><li>implement joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives;</li><li>conduct capacity building activities;</li><li>implement any other activities, coordinated between (a group of) partnership members, that contribute to the achievement of the partnership's objectives. Research projects resulting from coordinated national calls could be envisaged in this context as well.</li></ul><p>[1] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/promoting-our-european-way-life/european-health-union_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/promoting-our-european-way-life/european-health-union_en</a></p><p>[2] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/international_ghs-report-2022_en.pdf"">https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/international_ghs-report-2022_en.pdf</a></p><p>[3] Without prejudice to the ones set by the Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014</p><p>[4] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.</p><p>[5] (1) rapid transmission mode, (2) likelihood to reach a sensitive population, for example persons with minimal pre-existing immunity and (3) their high potential to cause high morbidity and mortality</p><p>[6] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/clinical-trials/accelerating-clinical-trials-eu-act-eu"">https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development/clinical-trials/accelerating-clinical-trials-eu-act-eu.</a> Under ACT EU, a concrete roadmap will be established for improved regulatory approval of clinical trials during public health emergencies.</p><p>[7] An ever-warm clinical trial network ensures a baseline of continuous clinical trial activity across a wide and diverse range of trial sites, which allows the rapid adaptation ('pivoting') of the trial in case of an epidemic or pandemic.</p><p>[8] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://isidore-project.eu/"">https://isidore-project.eu/</a></p><p>[9] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ecrin.org/"">https://ecrin.org/</a></p><p>[10] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://vaccelerate.eu/"">https://vaccelerate.eu/</a></p><p>[11] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ecraid.eu/"">https://www.ecraid.eu/</a></p><p>[12] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eu-response.eu/"">https://eu-response.eu/</a></p><p>[13] See definition of FAIR data in the introduction to this work programme part.</p><p>[14] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=d3988569-0434-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1&amp;format=pdf&amp;language=en&amp;productionSystem=cellar&amp;part="">https://op.europa.eu/o/opportal-service/download-handler?identifier=d3988569-0434-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1&amp;format=pdf&amp;language=en&amp;productionSystem=cellar&amp;part=</a></p><p>[15] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-10/ec_rtd_coherence-synergies-of-ep-under-he.pdf"">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2020-10/ec_rtd_coherence-synergies-of-ep-under-he.pdf</a></p><p>[16] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://health.ec.europa.eu/funding/eu4health-programme-2021-2027-vision-healthier-european-union_en"">https://health.ec.europa.eu/funding/eu4health-programme-2021-2027-vision-healthier-european-union_en</a></p><p>[17] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/digital-programme</a></p><p>[18] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/european-social-fund-plus/en"">https://ec.europa.eu/european-social-fund-plus/en</a></p><p>[19] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/funding/erdf_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/funding/erdf_en</a></p><p>[20] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://investeu.europa.eu/index_en"">https://investeu.europa.eu/index_en</a></p><p>[21] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/economic-recovery/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en#the-recovery-and-resilience-facility"">https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/economic-recovery/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en#the-recovery-and-resilience-facility</a></p><p>[22] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://commission.europa.eu/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/technical-support-instrument/technical-support-instrument-tsi_en"">https://commission.europa.eu/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/technical-support-instrument/technical-support-instrument-tsi_en</a></p><p>[23] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.globalhealth-edctp3.eu/"">https://www.globalhealth-edctp3.eu/</a></p><p>[24] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ctcan.africa/"">https://www.ctcan.africa</a></p><p>[25] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.glopid-r.org/"">https://www.glopid-r.org/</a></p>",,,,,

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have access to and use specific guidelines to implement health interventions that improve the availability of effective, equitable, efficient, integrated, patient-centred, safe, and timely care and the overall quality of life for people living with multiple long-term conditions including non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</li><li>Public health managers and authorities, including from other relevant sector (e. g., social, culture) have access to improved insights and evidence on how to decrease the fragmentation of care for patients living with multiple chronic conditions, and ensure continuity of care across all stages of disease progression. They use this knowledge to design policies to reduce health inequities.</li><li>Adopting an implementation science approach to studying interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs, researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding how the proposed interventions could be adopted in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations of HICs setting, taking into account specific social, political, economic and cultural contexts.</li><li>Communities and local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs and thus contribute to deliver better health.</li></ul><span>Scope:</span><p>The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD)<sup>[1]</sup>, an alliance of international funding agencies representing over 80% of the world's public health research funding and the first collaboration of its kind to specifically address NCDs. The GACD supports implementation science to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members and aligned with the 9<sup>th</sup> GACD call.</p><p>The topic is focused on implementation research for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs (MLTC NCD) in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations in HICs. Proposals should focus on implementation science around interventions that will generate evidence about when, for whom, and under what circumstances, patient-centred approaches can improve integrated care for patients with MLTC NCD.</p><p>MLTC NCD refers to the co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions, at least one of which is an NCD. NCDs include for example cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, hypertension, haematological disorders, sleep disorders, and mental health disorders. The high prevalence of MLTC NCD is projected to rise with the ageing population and the increasing burden of NCDs. MLTC NCD has a profound impact on patients, and is associated with premature death, physical disability, substance abuse, poor quality of life, mental health issues, and financial difficulties from high costs of care. It is also associated with difficulties in adherence to and high rates of adverse effects from treatment with multiple medications. In addition, due to poor health and the complexity of managing their conditions, patients with MLTC NCD are high utilisers of health care systems, which is especially challenging in low-resourced contexts.</p><p>Addressing MLTC NCD demands a shift from fragmented models of care, which treat individual health issues separately as they occur, to a more holistic integrated care model that provides a whole person focus on health management<sup>[2]</sup>. The current evidence suggests that primary healthcare<sup>[3]</sup>, integrated and coordinated care, patient-centred interventions, digital health technology, and optimised medication therapy are key to improved management of MLTC NCD. However, implementing patient-centred strategies for treating MLTC NCD remains challenging and largely unexplored in disadvantaged contexts, especially in LMICs. Adapting and scaling such models is critical to improving quality of life; reducing disability; reducing the burden of caretaking on (typically female) family members and reducing health system costs.</p><p>The proposed implementation research must focus on one or more evidence-based interventions (or complex interventions) known to promote integrated management of multiple long-term conditions, including NCDs. It should assess patient-centred interventions focused on patient management or self-management, or interventions that transform communities, clinical practice, and/or health systems. Applicants should justify the choice of intervention(s) and provide evidence of the intervention's effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and potential for long-term health and other impacts. Ideally, evidence of the intervention's real-world effectiveness should be supported by a well-conducted systematic review where available. As the evidence for how to manage MLTC NCD is still emerging, particularly in LMICs, a limited period of testing the effectiveness of an intervention that the applicant's team has adapted for local implementation is therefore usually appropriate.</p><p>Applicants must explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study population(s) taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s) in which the study will take place. Applicants should justify why any adaptation will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following activities<sup>[4]</sup>:</p><ul><li>Provide a research plan using validated implementation research frameworks or hybrid design research;</li><li>Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators;</li><li>Specifically address health equity and the principles of Universal Health Coverage<sup>[5]</sup>;</li><li>Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous-Indigenous members of the project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy;</li><li>Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from key stakeholders for delivering patient-centred care and a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention after the funding ends;</li><li>Provide opportunities for implementation research capacity building for early career researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or disadvantaged communities.</li><li>Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one early career member as a co-investigator.</li></ul><p>Applicants are also encouraged to follow a life course approach, adapting the intervention to one or more key life stage(s) critical for reducing the onset or progression of MLTC NCD, and to explore how to best implement digital technology interventions.</p><p>The study population may include patients with existing MLTC NCD, or existing NCDs (e.g., studies focusing on rolling out screening services for multiple NCDs). The study population may also include patients with chronic infectious disease(s) (e.g., studies that focus on integrating NCD management into an HIV or tuberculosis clinic) or a mixture of both.</p><p>The following are potential interventions or strategies that applicants may consider in their implementation plan (please note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li>Strategies for improving MLTC NCD identification, stratification/staging, management, and/or monitoring such as investigating strategies for adapting and implementing the protocol(s) described in the WHO Package of Essential NCD Interventions (WHO PEN)<sup>[6]</sup> that address MLTC NCD management. For example, projects may focus on integrating NCD care into clinics that typically focus on the management of infectious diseases, such as HIV or tuberculosis clinics, or the integration of NCD care into maternal and child health clinics;</li><li>Strategies to streamline and improve quality of care among individuals with MLTC NCD to reduce fragmentation of services, including task-sharing and/or the use of clinical decision-making tools (e.g., digital tools);</li><li>Strategies and/or tools (e.g., digital tools) that optimise appropriate medication and (non-pharmacological) therapeutic prescribing, adherence, and/or reduced drug interactions/ adverse effects;</li><li>Interventions that improve transitions through the health system, from community to primary to tertiary care and beyond, such as to home care or hospice;</li><li>Health behavioural change interventions that target different risk factor clusters (e.g., exercise, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse).</li></ul><p>The proposal's primary outcome measures must be implementation research outcomes to assess MLTC NCD. With regard to MLTC NCD, applicants are encouraged to explore any combination of chronic conditions, including mental health disorders and sleep disorders. The specific combination of conditions should be justified using local or regional epidemiological data about their co-occurrence. Outcome measures should appropriately address implementation tackling MLTC NCD, and not focus on one condition. Proposals may also contain a strategy for measuring other secondary outcomes (or proxy outcomes) that demonstrate the intervention's real-world effectiveness in the local context and target populations. Additionally, other health or non-health outcome measures, especially those identified as important by patient participants and/or critical for advancing Universal Health Coverage, are also welcome.</p><p>Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider the social determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g., gender, ethnicity), then the reason for this should be justified.</p><p>In order to promote health equity, proposals should aim to address differences in intervention access, uptake, and effectiveness in socially disadvantaged groups and develop strategies for reducing inequities. To facilitate this process at the data analysis stage, studies should be designed to address such differences. At a minimum, studies should capture sex and/or gender differences. If feasible, a plan for capturing intersectional impacts on health outcomes should be included in the analysis strategy.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>For implementation research to have a strong likelihood of being taken up into policy or practice and informing the scale up of effective interventions, it is vital that project teams engage the appropriate stakeholders. Proposals should present a strategy to include the relevant decision makers such as policymakers, ministry officials, local authorities, non-governmental organisation leaders, community leaders as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organizations involved in the implementation of the intervention, from the development to the implementation knowledge translation phase. It is also important to include stakeholders who can help sustain the project's implementation, facilitate scale up, and use the knowledge generated from the project after the grant ends.</p><p>Stakeholders also include patients, their family members and carers. Their contributions should be nurtured through meaningful engagement from the outset, not only as participants in the research undertaken. Patient engagement throughout the research project is critical to developing patient-centred models of care.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing, to some of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>Public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private ones, in the area of health and care stimulate the competitive development of market-ready, environmentally sustainable innovative solutions (materials, technologies and systems/practices). These solutions take into consideration the green deal ambitions on zero pollution, climate neutrality and circular economy, while increasing the overall sustainability of the sector.</li><li>Procurers open up opportunities for European health and technology industry actors (including start-ups/SMEs) to bring to the market innovations that are cost-efficient, safe and proven to increase environmental sustainability while improving or at least maintaining health outcomes and access to care for patients.</li><li>Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of environmentally sustainable innovative solutions by their successful suppliers through providing them with first customer references for the validation and first pilot deployment.</li><li>Policymakers, health care providers and professionals, patients and carers - each in their respective areas - exchange and adopt good practices and the best solutions and technologies that the market can deliver to reduce carbon emissions and minimise waste and pollution stemming from health and care provision, in line with the Green Deal ambitions.</li></ul><span>Scope:</span><p>The healthcare sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions<sup>[1]</sup> contributing significantly to Europe's carbon footprint and to the generation of large amounts of plastics and other waste, including chemical waste through the discharge of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic chemicals as well as disinfectants and antimicrobial resistant pathogens into the wastewater system. Good hygiene and safety are vital in this setting however innovative solutions can help to reduce the environmental impact of the healthcare sector through the efficient use of resources, increasing circularity, and the introduction of 'greener? materials, technologies and practices.</p><p>Up to now the healthcare sector has not significantly embraced the green transition. However, pressure is increasing as demonstrated by the launch of the first ever Declaration on Climate and Health<sup>[2]</sup> by the UAE COP28 presidency. The declaration calls for action and joint vision on ensuring better health outcomes, in part through the transformation of health and care systems to become climate-resilient, low-carbon, sustainable, circular and equitable. Such a transformation will contribute in the long term to improving patient care by enhancing both the sustainability and overall efficiency of health and care systems.</p><p>Pre-commercial procurement (PCP) actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to procure together the development of innovative solutions for greening the health and care systems. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform R&amp;D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon Europe work programme.</p><p>As every step in health and care delivery has a role in reducing its environmental footprint, the topic can support any of the different dimensions and needs for the greening of the healthcare sector.</p><p>Proposals should target either:</p><ul><li>Direct and indirect footprint deriving from the provision and/or delivery of care (excluding infrastructural elements related to building, transport logistics and food footprints).</li><li>Circularity, waste production and treatment.</li><li>Footprint from the chain of suppliers in making and delivering products, or services.</li><li>More efficient use of resources, decreasing the overall sector footprint while addressing the constantly increasing demand for healthcare.</li></ul><p>Focus should be on solutions that are specific to the healthcare sector therefore proposals targeting general infrastructure (energy efficiency of buildings such cooling, heating and ventilation, vehicles, construction or refurbishment), energy supply or food and catering services do not fall within scope. Within this topic, it is possible to foresee the transfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health and care systems. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovation.</p><p>Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. clinical teams, patients or hospital structures etc) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to potentially interested suppliers.</p><p>Involvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by health and care systems increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to purchase at least one solution resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will (1) procure the solution(s) as part of the PCP or (2) in a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP. In the first case, procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP (see general annex H) and foresee the budget to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers must include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase successful solution(s) after the PCP.</p><p>[1] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2820%2930271-0"">https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2820%2930271-0</a></p><p>[2] <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/cop28-uae-declaration-climate-and-health"">https://reliefweb.int/report/world/cop28-uae-declaration-climate-and-health</a></p>",,,,,

However, predicting such effects currently involves a large uncertainty due to the difficulty in estimating the relevant characteristics of these structures. There is therefore a need to efficiently estimate such characteristics from available data such as imagery or documentation and to combine them with effect prediction models to provide reliable predictions. During operations, this should be performed in a limited time and possibly with limited available computing power. This is especially important for relatively large urban areas including many structures.</p><p>Software solutions for automated structural modelling and effect prediction should therefore be developed. They should offer the best possible accuracy, and trust should be ensured in the measurement of their performances. Given the complexity of the task, they need to rely not only on physics-based models but also on artificial intelligence, and they should be evaluated in an objective manner on data that is representative of the targeted use cases. This involves the collection and annotation of representative data. In order to ensure the reproducibility of experiments and for economic reasons, it is important that such data is reusable for similar developments, including by other technology developers. It also involves the testing of systems on new data using documented metrics and testing protocols, in a way that ensures comparability with similar systems developed by such other actors.</p><p>Models for the prediction of effects of weapons on structures are often used in conjunction with other models in decision support tools, for example to estimate freedom of manoeuvre or effectiveness of communication.

(see 2.3.2), the main objective of this action is to consolidate existing results and move towards an ecosystem of mature and networked LDTs across the EU to help cities and communities achieve economies of scale when developing their data platform and LDT services.</p><p>EU cities and communities are evolving towards digital communities at a different pace and this topic is proposing three complementary activities to help them achieve economies of scale when adopting data, LDT and AI-based solutions. Previous WP supported the creation of an EU data space for smart communities (and its validation via pilots) and action 2.3.2 pioneers innovative services using 'Citiverse' technology. Under the WP 2021-22, the Commission has also launched procurement actions to support the development of a LDT toolbox in the EU. However, more effort is needed to create a pan-European ecosystem of digital twins that can connect and scale up towards a future 'EU CitiVerse?. To achieve the approach is to support the development of open source LDT solutions based on common needs of EU cities and communities (both urban and rural), to connect them and to enrich them with additional innovative services. In order to address the different maturity level of cities and communities, this action will help (1) connect and further develop the already existing LDTs, (2) gain a critical mass of smart communities' data sets, as well as (3) deploy, test, and add more complex AI-based elements to the LDT toolbox, addressing the needs of digitally advanced smart communities.</p><p>These and future actions regarding LDTs are contributing to the effective implementation of a Multi Country Project (MCP) in the area of Connected Public Administration.</p><p>The action is divided in three objectives, each to be achieved through a separate work strand:</p><ul><li>Objective 1: <strong>Technical inter-connection of existing LDTs:</strong> Connecting data platforms and LDTs from cities and communities that already have a LDT in place, in order to create an EU 'federation? of LDTs. Reinforced interoperability through the aggregation of LDTs at a larger scale (cross sectors, cross cities, and cross borders) will help to scale up the EU common data sets and open-source solutions. It will also facilitate the way for less advanced cities and communities who wish to join the existing EU LDT ecosystem.</li><li>Objective 2: <strong>Creation of LDTs based on common needs:</strong> Developing open-source pilots of LDTs services, based on shared needs of cities and communities that already have a local data platform and/or a LDT and want to expand them with new real-life use case services. These services should aim to improve decision-making processes and citizen interaction; reduce risks, costs and downtime; enhance resilience and sustainability of LDT platforms and enable new value creation.</li><li>Objective 3: <strong>Adding new complex AI-based tools to the LDTs toolbox</strong>: Complementing the EU LDT toolbox launched under WP2021-22 with additional complex AI-based and innovative services (e.g., for adaptable multi-sector considerations, advanced simulation and modelling approaches including bottom-up self-organised models). The AI services should be developed and tested within existing cities/communities and be transferable to other contexts.</li></ul><p>These objectives will be implemented through three work strands by a single project that will provide cascading funding to the third parties through a single call.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>The selected proposal will manage a community of projects selected by cascading funding mechanism. The work of these projects will be implemented through three main work strands:</p><ul><li>Work strand 1: Connect existing LDTs at EU level and lay down the foundations of an EU LDT ecosystem. When connecting LDTs, and their related data sets, projects should align with the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl to achieve interoperability and make use of horizontal services available under the Digital Europe programme such as the Smart Communities dataspace blueprint, the EU data cloud infrastructure and the EU LDT toolbox.</li><li>Work strand 2: Launch new pilot LDT services based on common needs of cities and communities to enhance interoperability and collaboration. The services should be tested in real-life conditions and expand the EU LDT ecosystem by making use of and contributing to the development of the EU LDT toolbox catalogue. The pilots should include at least the following activities:</li></ul><ol> <li>designing real life use cases based on open and interoperable data sets across sectors. The use of these data sets should follow requirements of the data space for smart cities and communities' blueprint;</li><li>building and deploying the pilot services on LDT platforms at city/community level with real use case data;</li><li>defining roadmaps for making available the LDT-based services on the EU LDT toolbox catalogue</li></ol><ul><li>Work strand 3: Add new complex AI-based components to the forthcoming EU LDT toolbox to address the needs of cities/communities:</li></ul><ol> <li>Develop and deliver new AI-based services to create simulations, predictive models and forecast in a variety of sectors and use cases amongst which the New European Bauhaus, public services and communities' resilience;</li><li>Develop and deliver solutions for designing, optimising, and testing urban policies in dynamic complex environments with several interwoven sectors (e.g., traffic volume and pollution levels). AI classical optimization may be complemented with self-organised bottom-up solutions that will offer the necessary adaptability and robustness;</li><li>Develop and deliver new complex AI-based services related to citizen's engagement, with or without the use of eXtended Reality technology to address aspects of the New European Bauhaus initiative and implement a sustainable, democratic and citizen-centric CitiVerse.</li></ol><p>To maximize the scale-up and reusability of the new services, these should be designed in such a way that they can be adopted by different maturity levels LDT architectures.</p>",,,,,

They are the interface between rural and urban environments and are often the subject of high pressure from the urban core which results in an un-controlled and uneven urban expansion towards the rural territory often triggering environmental degradation. While dispersed and heterogenous in terms of land-occupancy, density and services and amenities distribution, the peri-urban territory integrates mutual inter-dependences within the urban-rural continuum. These can be associated with people (inwards and outwards migration or socio-demographic change) as well as with linkages and flows between a variety of rural and urban related functions and activities (ranging from industrial and recycling manufacturing, agriculture production and food processing, sanitation, waste disposal, drinking water provisions, to housing - including slums and gated communities - transport and associated infrastructure, large-scale commercial sites, and large recreational areas such as parks or forests), which juxtapose, collide and mesh in unintended and unplanned ways.</p><p>Peri-urban areas are also the subject of weaker governance structures and limited institutional capacity, which in return limits the capacity to regulate economic activities and land-use and land coverage and makes it difficult to implement effective and integrated local, regional, and functional urban area wide policies and programs. This is particularly challenging in areas that straddle multiple jurisdictions, such as urban-rural fringe.</p><p>This topic aims to foster the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within the current peri-urban development and planning practice to reduce these areas GHG emissions and to improve their liveability.</p><p>Proposals, depending on chosen domains, should investigate a sustainable and decarbonised development of the peri-urban areas by shifting from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources in mobility, energy or industry domains supported by adequate governance structures and practices based on a sustainable land-use planning and an urban expansion which integrates environmental considerations and determinants. In addition, proposals should provide European demonstration-type examples on how to sustainably integrate climate-neutral, green, and smart solutions and measures into the peri-urban/urban development and the existing transport, energy, and industrial infrastructures, to achieve long-term decarbonization impacts and necessary climate resilience. Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project. Positive, long-term impacts on social cohesion, economic development, and public perception - resulting in behavioural change and policy change - should be fostered and anticipated. Proposals, depending on selected domains should:</p><ul><li>Explore particular characteristics of peri-urban areas that are distinct from rural and urban ones and analyse relevant urban-rural dynamics such as continuous and frequent land-use and functional changes, poor and inaccessible transport infrastructure, scattered and unevenly distributed day-to-day services and amenities.</li><li>Explore models of urban/peri-urban development and planning containing the above-mentioned dynamics (e.g., expansion model, densification model, green-belts and green-corridors model) aimed at overcoming the sustainability, decarbonisation and local climate (e.g. heat islands) challenges of the urban-rural fringe while ensuring co-creation with and engagement of the relevant stakeholders (including citizens and communities).</li><li>Focus on domains that are particularly pertinent in achieving progress in sustainable development, such as: <ul><li>Mobility and transport with extensive use of personal cars with combustion engines, poor and scattered infrastructure, and lack of sustainable transport options. Transport related emissions that are exacerbated by intensive commuter flows generated by peri-urban areas. City focused solutions that are not adapted to peri-urban areas and challenges often exceeding organizational, financial and knowledge capacities of local authorities. Proposals should analyse and explore how peri-urban generated traffic impacts the transport flows (for both goods and people) and its contribution to the total CO2/emissions of the entire urbanized territory.</li><li>Industry, accounting for 30% of CO2 emissions and often located in peri-urban areas, is capital in succeeding the transition towards a net zero economy. Proposals should analyse the contribution to the total emissions reduction, of improved energy efficiency measures in industrial processes located in peri-urban areas, as well as of the deployment of strategic net-zero technologies, such as solar, (PV and thermal), wind, hydrogen, batteries and storage (incl. thermal energy storage), heat pumps and geothermal energy, electrolysers and fuel cells, biogas/biomethane, carbon capture and storage, and grid technologies, as envisaged in the EU Net Zero Industry Act. Proposals should ramp up and facilitate public-private partnerships, notably the key role of Local Green Deals (LGDs).</li><li>Circular economy: Peri-urban areas are key for setting up recycling facilities for materials, products and equipment and scaling up material reuse, such as Social Urban Mining and recycling infrastructure across different industries (e.g., online marketplaces to empower exchange for materials, or physical Materials Banks for construction and demolition materials). Proposals should explore, analyse and facilitate the deployment of innovative industrial recycling processes, industrial symbiosis and closed-loop systems, as well as supporting knowledge transfer through innovative practices; piloting local platforms for Social Urban Mining<sup>[1]</sup>; demonstrating recycling and re-use processes for building and public works materials, industrial waste, water and waste management; enabling material reuse; inducing circular practices, reuse of materials and behavioural change.</li><li>Vulnerability of peri-urban areas to environmental damage as most of the urban wastes (solid and liquid) and pollutant activities are pushed in the peripheries.</li><li>Electricity grids and heating/cooling solutions are suboptimal in some peri-urban areas. The often-low energy efficiency and individual fossil fuel or even solid fuel-based heating of the building stock exacerbates energy poverty in the absence of sufficient population density for district heating while the lower real estate prices hamper deep renovation. The opportunities of available space for i.e., clean energy production or electricity and thermal storage are not sufficiently exploited to increase living comfort, accelerate energy transition for the benefit of the local economy and nearby urban areas.</li><li>Governance, as peri-urban areas can be beyond the legal authority of cities, nor are they considered as part of the rural administrative units. Therefore, the capacity to regulate economic activities (and thus land-use and land coverage) is weak. This results in the peri-urbanization being largely an unplanned process, informal and sometime illegal and often resulting in environmental hazards and degradation of natural resources. This also results in a scattered and uneven distribution of services, amenities, and resources across the peri-urban area. The weaker governance structures complicate also integrated planning and green procurement of energy, transport, and other services.</li><li>Social and cultural characteristics of peri-urban areas that are gaining on heterogeneity with continuous social dynamics. In many (Central and Eastern) EU cities the peri-urban expansion was driven by the emergence of a stronger middle class. However, in more recent years there has been an increasingly heterogenous mix of occupants/actors with multiple and most often conflicting interests, including settled populations, populations living in gated estates, in-migrants, transient workers, emerging middle-class among others. This overall leads to heterogeneous communities and, in general, to a lack of social cohesion.</li> </ul></li></ul><p>The research actions should cover the following:</p><ul><li>Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way, and provide a summary of measures contributing to climate neutrality in European peri-urban areas, identifying barriers.</li><li>Establish co-designing process and engaging with the relevant stakeholders (such as: citizens, local authorities, mobility operators, service providers, energy companies, private businesses?) to ensure a successful uptake of solutions contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.</li><li>Develop, test, and demonstrate scalable solutions in real life in at least two out of the four domains (Mobility, Energy, Industry, Governance) contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.</li></ul><p>Each proposal should involve stakeholders from at least three 'lead urban/peri-urban areas', and at least three 'replicator' urban/peri-urban areas. Each urban/peri-urban area should establish a living laboratory where, under real life-conditions, a set of complementary and reinforcing solutions, centred on two to four aspects from the ones presented above (mobility, energy, industry, and governance) should be developed, tested, and implemented in an integrated approach. The participating urban/peri-urban areas, which may have a geographical coverage that goes as far as the full functional urban area, should demonstrate their common interests, and outline how they will ensure a meaningful and close cooperation. The peri-urban areas should each be situated in different EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe. Each proposal should at least include one urban area of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities.</p><p>To allow for a thorough evaluation of the projects' outcomes, proposals are expected to provide measurable indicators to demonstrate how the tested solutions are contributing to the climate neutrality objectives of the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission and participating peri-urban areas. These should be supported by clear baselines, quantified targets, and appropriate review processes for each participating urban area. The baselines for the expected outcomes should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation.</p><p>Projects are expected to collaborate with the established and widely applied process and impact evaluation framework (using both clear baselines and measurable impact indicators) as well as the corporate design, the dissemination and information exchange frameworks put in place by the Commission (e.g. the Mission Platform, the CIVITAS initiative, Scalable cities, New European Bauhaus Community, the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, etc.) and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the EIT, such as, for example, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT Culture and Creativity or EIT Food, EU Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, and Driving Urban Transitions Partnership (DUT), depending on the area. They shall contribute to the development of the existing European knowledge base on the effectiveness and impacts resulting from the implementation of innovative, sustainable, green, and inclusive solutions in urban areas.</p><p>Clear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take-up during and beyond the project are expected, which could, for example, be in the form of follow-up actions funded by CEF, ELENA, or similar programmes.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Inclusiveness of vulnerable populations (older people, children) as well as gender perspectives should be considered.</p><p>[1] <sup></sup>Social Urban Mining - is the concept of creating extended value of demolished buildings by optimizing the deconstruction phase through re-use and high-value recycling.

Many of these pollutants emanate from the same sources as greenhouse gas emissions being tackled in the context of the EU Mission Climate-Neutral Smart Cities, so it is clear there are potential environmental co-benefits from reducing GHG emissions.<sup>[2]</sup> Designing effective policies to protect city dwellers from pollution depends on solid evidence as well as on cooperation and communication between and with policy makers and citizens.</p><p>Due to resource constraints, city administrations may often need to prioritise between different actions on different forms of pollution - and for this a solid risk-based evidence-base of the exposure to, impacts of and measures against pollution will allow to arrive at more informed and cost-effective local measures. These measures are often closely connected and affected by energy policy choices demonstrating the benefits of holistic approaches in for instance the planning, budgeting and assessment of costs and benefits in environmental, energy and climate policies at local level.</p><p>More informed, coherent and targeted local measures will help European cities to deliver environmental co-benefits under the EU Mission for Climate-Neutral, Smart Cities, comply with or exceed EU legislative standards for air and water quality, and supporting the delivery of environmental objectives such as the targets of the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan and commitments under the Green City Accord.</p><p>Applicants should propose projects that deliver better and innovative local measures against pollution through, among others, improved knowledge on the exposures of citizens to pollution and improved health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and/or noise pollution.

Once implemented they should help policy makers prioritise actions, and address social aspects of zero pollution policies,</li><li>Support implementation of zero pollution policies by overcoming barriers to behavioural change which natural science and evidence alone cannot overcome. New approaches to address these barriers should be explored from the angles of behavioural economics, psychology, communication and organisational behaviour, with a view to inform effective local and regional zero pollution policies.</li></ul><p>Project(s) funded under this topic should involve at least two cities. Ideally at least one city in each project should be a city selected for the EU Mission Climate-Neutral Smart Cities and/or a city signatory to the EU Green City Accord (these can be the same city).</p><p>To increase impact and coherence, project(s) should maximise coordination and complementarity with the 'Climate-Neutral Smart cities' Mission platform.

The collaboration with the Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date. Synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives, such as the European Green Capital / Leaf Awards, European Urban Initiative, the Covenant of Mayors Europe and the New European Bauhaus. Work performed or underway in other Horizon funded projects should also be considered, to the extent feasible, to avoid overlaps or contradictory conclusions.

From the reallocation of the urban public space to more sustainable forms of transport and energy generation and use, intermodal hubs, and interchanges to the dynamic management of the street profile and curb side, and the integration of suburban/peripheral areas in the general urban fabric and patterns, current and future research should aim to make urban public spaces more liveable while enabling better a connectivity, accessibility, social interaction, inclusion and transit in the context of a changing climate. Concepts like the '15-minute city? and 'superblocks? are gaining momentum and have an enormous potential in shaping the urban planning and design practice and the mobility services based on the principle of proximity. This is supporting the efficient and green mobility goals, the transport and energy policies, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the new EU Urban Mobility Framework.</p><p>Considering the optimisation of urban public spaces, aspects related to air quality and urban climate must be considered by designing strategies based on new technologies and green infrastructures/green city zones.</p><p>The proposal should address the question on how to deal with limited urban public space and conflicting demands for it between transport and other users, considering social and climate goals and the need to shift towards more energy efficient and sustainable modes of transport, decarbonisation of the heating and cooling infrastructures.</p><p>Each proposal should envisage pilot demonstrations in at least three cities (lead cities) situated each in a different Member State or Associated Country including both urban and sub-urban areas. Proposals should provide the necessary evidence of the cities' commitment to test and implement the co-designed solutions. To foster replicability and up-taking of the outcomes, each proposal should also engage at least three replication/follower cities with the development of local replication plans. The size and characteristics of the cities should be considered. Each proposal should include at least one city of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities for the lead cities and one for the replication/follower cities.</p><p>The pilots should involve a co-design process with the stakeholders concerned by the re-design of the urban space. The pilots should involve public and private local energy, mobility and industrial stakeholders as well as civil society to identify integrated, locally supported and space-saving solutions and related pre-conditions (incentives, participatory methods, etc.) in a change management process to gain public acceptance by information, participation and consideration of groups that were so far disadvantaged by existing conditions.</p><p>Demonstrations should be 'digital by default' and use Local Digital Twins and, where possible, Mobility Data Spaces as tools for optimizing traffic, improving mobility services, monitoring environmental benefits in air and noise, and modelling a better use of urban space.</p><p>Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project.</p><p>Proposals should address the following two areas of intervention:</p><p><strong>1. Reallocation of space and re-design of infrastructure</strong></p><p>This is a major game changer in cities in favour of more sustainable and efficient use of resources through integrated approaches that promote decarbonisation of different sectors notably sustainable modes of transport, buildings and industry and related services. By (re)designing and reallocating the urban public space to reflect the level of use of different transport modes, unsustainable transport, heating and cooling modes can be discouraged while sustainable ones incentivised. Smart urban public space design and management is also a key enabler for scaling-up new mobility services. First, it can help to develop more sustainable and accessible mobility services, with stations and hubs for shared devices and charging infrastructures, dedicated lanes for light and active modes, pick-up and drop-off zones, etc. Also, it can help to increase the acceptance of sustainable mobility services, by mitigating negative externalities caused by the inadequate use of urban space, such as illegal parking, and cluttering the sidewalks by e-scooters, advertising banners, traffic signals and others. The reallocation of space is also important to transform roads from mere transit spaces into public spaces with a higher socioeconomic value to people - a feature which has become extremely important for local recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The same applies to the planning and management of urban space to accommodate local clean and smart energy infrastructures to power the different uses of energy including mobility, buildings, commercial and industrial activities. One goal of the energy system integration would be to optimise the use of urban space and existing infrastructures to avoid unnecessary investments in distribution grids while increasing energy autonomy of the municipalities and reducing losses in transmission and distribution of energy. Moreover, planning and implementing simultaneously infrastructure projects can significantly reduce investment costs and space needs such as e.g. building an underground car park together with space for a geothermal heat pump or thermal heat storage.</p><p>Four of the following research actions should be addressed to overcome these challenges either in the mobility (points 1 to 4) or energy area (points 5 to 8):</p><ol> <li>Develop integrated transport and urban planning tools and methods to coordinate sustainable mobility services and the design of future public realms, accounting also for their interrelations and impacts across different spatial and temporal scales. This should be linked to the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) of the cities.</li><li>For electromobility, foster research results from pilot projects on reallocation of use of transport infrastructure - or use of the single infrastructure for diverse types of vehicles, amenities (such as bi-directional charging points), and vehicles (e.g. after hours sharing of publicly accessible transport fleets) throughout the community of stakeholders at EU level.</li><li>Research solutions for the exploitation of legacy infrastructure and how it can contribute to the scaling of sustainable mobility services followed by projects and demonstrations that can help to better understand this space shift, and play a significant role in the design, piloting and roll-out and assessment of these new mobility services.<s>;</s> Past experiences with street space reallocation (e.g. temporary infrastructures under COVID-19) can serve as a basis.</li><li>Involvement of current service providers and infrastructure managers (e.g. parking service providers) in the urban space ecosystem to understand how current players can contribute to new mobility services, increased multimodality, electrification and integrated city logistics and citizens' mobility.</li><li>With regards to energy, support pilot projects to increase understanding and exploitation of the potential of road space allocation and smart distributed energy generation and green city zones/infrastructures in a systemic manner and monitoring their positive effects on human well-being.</li><li>Research opportunities for exploiting current infrastructures (e.g. buildings, grids, underground spaces) complemented by additional elements (e.g. access to data in real time, demand response, storage, smart charging, heat and energy storage) to facilitate local energy communities, virtual power plants and energy sharing while minimising the need for new infrastructures requiring space and facilitating multipurpose construction projects. This should also include the integration of thermal and electricity grids and storage to better manage and balance renewable electricity generation and demand.</li><li>Establish an integrated approach for designing and decarbonising the heating and cooling networks (including distributed installations and small-scale networks and related storage) in cities and urban areas in synchronisation with planning of new housing, major renovations or industrial development related to major heat consuming or waste heat generating facilities.</li><li>Explore ways of using/optimising green and blue infrastructures to city and street scale for improving urban climate, reduce the energy demand and in view of emission free transport.</li></ol><p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Dynamic curb-side management and use</strong></p><p>Smart management of urban space and existing infrastructure includes their dynamic use, when considering curb space, changing its role and function in time, depending on parameters, functions and needs in relation to commuting peak hours, deliveries, public transport priority, market days, nightlife, etc. Dynamic space management is already being explored in some cities and represents an opportunity for further integration in mobility plans with the support of smart technologies, Intelligent Transport Systems, Local Digital Twins and Mobility Data Spaces, AI based autonomous optimal control and management systems.</p><p>As the rise of new shared mobility services such as ride hailing, micromobility and the growth in urban goods delivery (even more so with the recent exponential growth of e-commerce) are challenging traditional ways of managing curb space, novel approaches are needed. Research on a shift away from curb use focused on street parking to a more flexible and dynamic allocation that for example includes pick-up and drop-off zones for passengers and freight or dedicated public transport lanes during peak hours, has also shown the potential to enhance and prioritise sustainable mobility services, and thus decrease the pressure on traffic thanks to an increased percentage of shared rides.</p><p>To ensure the implementation of these innovative approaches, R&amp;I could support by developing:</p><ul><li>Tools and guidelines to ensure the implementation of innovative approaches of dynamic space and curb use, resulting from tests and pilots of flexible allocation of curb side functions, including pick-up and drop-off zones for passengers and freight.</li><li>New models of fee calculation (e.g. trip purpose, space demand (size) of each vehicle using the public domain, etc.) and financial model for the use of public space in cities in view of reaching public policy goals including climate neutrality.</li></ul><p>To increase impact and coherence, project(s) should maximise coordination with leading European associations and initiatives in this domain, e.g. Living-In.EU, the New European Bauhaus, Covenant of Mayors, the EIT KIC Culture and Creativity, the EIT Urban Mobility, the CIVITAS initiative, the 2Zero partnership and EU co-funded projects in the domain of Technologies for Smart Communities. Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential, and projects must ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work plan of the proposal. The collaboration with the Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date.</p>",,,,,

As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries.

Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.</p><p>In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.</p><p>The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today's military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.</p><p>A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.</p><p>The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.</p><p>Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.</p><p>The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:</p><p><u>1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States </u></p><p>The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.</p><p><u>2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services </u></p><p>The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.</p><p><u>3/ Flexibility and scalability </u></p><p>The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.</p><p><u>4/ Innovation </u></p><p>The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.</p><p><u>5/ Security and resilience </u></p><p>The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address system prototyping of the baseband equipment (satellite modem), the on-board satellite active transponder and ancillary systems, as well as the testing of all prototypes (modems, on board active transponders and ancillary systems) operating the EPW in a controlled and operational military environment.</p><p><strong><em>Types of

This type of battlefield, previously purely oil-based from cradle to grave, to integrate energy management technologies, buffer storage resources and a camp/weapon system interface in a constrained and contested tactical environment, is in need of a comprehensive review of its energy production and distribution. It requires the implementation of a coherent and efficient energy network, from the energy production systems at operational level to the soldiers at tactical level, through all the layers of the distribution systems.</p><p>In parallel, the EU defence sector has to start its digital and green energy transition to contribute to the EU net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and to anticipate growing energy costs linked to the vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies becoming increasingly scarce and disputed.</p><p>This development entails major risks for military activities. The multiplication of low-carbon energy sources and the risk of more complex logistics are an additional challenge for manoeuvres. It is also an opportunity to meet the growing demand for future weapons systems, platforms and devices.</p><p>An energy-independent and energy efficient deployable military camp, as part of the future electric battlefield, is the first step towards an operational and tactical integrated energy supply chain. It serves as a starting point, hub for innovative electric energy generation and efficient distribution throughout all levels. This includes initial definitions of interface between the stationary components (operational level) and the mobile components (tactical level) of the electric battlefield.</p><p>As the role of the military camps, as an energy provider has been emphasised, scaling-up of its technological bricks (energy generation, storage and distribution) needs to be amplified while covering a wide range of operational scenarios.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to substitute the fossil fuel dependency reduction in military deployable camps (support and mobility) without any drop of operational performances, in a context of increasing electrical energy demand in the battlefield. Moreover, investigation on the return of experience of the demonstration stage, should include specifications of a whole concept of energy independent and efficient deployable camps. Furthermore, the ability to support the diminution of their fossil fuel consumptions while maintaining operational performances, avoiding logistics, security burden and reducing logistics footprint should be validated.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address a full-scale operational demonstrator of a deployable camp fulfilling interoperability between inter-allied armies and NATO, with a modular and easily deployable energy system and adaptable energy mix.</p><p>Proposals must pursue the feasibility study of different technologies to answer to the identified needs of the Member States and EDF Associated Countries while ensuring the interoperability of systems and taking into consideration opportunities such as autonomy or resilience. As innovative solutions evolve rapidly, the proposals should update results generated through the latest research in this domain. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness of logistics and maintenance in different scenarios (e.g., Host Nation Support, Contractor Support to Operations or by military themselves).</p><p>Proposals must design and produce the solutions (production, storage and management modules, including control and command interfaces, communication protocols, and operational simulation and planning systems). In order to ensure their safe use, functional tests must be performed before the demonstration stage.</p><p>Proposals must address physical experiment of the most critical technological modules deployed in military camps, especially the most vulnerable ones toward harsh environmental conditions and demanding operational scenarios, including resilience against electronic warfare, cyber-attacks and electromagnetic pulse.</p><p>Proposals must split the demonstration of the technological modules in different locations hosted by several Member States in different representative environment (cold/warm weather, dust, number of occupants, deployment duration, type of mission, etc.). In addition, the proposals must validate a wide range of operational use cases and assess the adaptability of the technology for the deployment in different scenarios. Adding up, they should ensure testing, validation and qualification of the overall concept through simulation activities in real military context including in harsh conditions. Furthermore, the ability of the energy architectures and protocols endorsed to operate in civil-based (non-rugged) solutions should be demonstrated. The demonstration should cover the simulation and planning tools.</p><p>The focus must be on military use-cases, taking into account specific harsh military environment (cold/heat/dust), different deployments and conflict intensities (including the shift from low-intensity conflict to high-intensity warfare), different deployed infrastructures, different life-time phases of the camp (storage, building, operation and redeployment phase) and military heavy constraints (logistic, maintenance, training, risk management, unmanned).</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table> <thead> <tr> <td><p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p><p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>(a)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(b)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(c)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(d)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(e)</p></td> <td><p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(f)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(g)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(h)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(i)</p></td> <td><p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul><li>Studies: <ul><li>Study activities must build on ongoing, completed civil-based and military research and follow as well new solutions available on the market (hydrogen/synthetic fuels, non-fossil fuels from renewable sources, smart grid, microgrids, self-healing power systems, etc.) to validate the feasibility of deploying such solutions in operations areas.

Labour intensive manual planning is infeasible within the constraints of available time and resources. The general objective is to develop advanced automated support tools for the generation and evaluation of courses of action (COAs) in an MDO context.

In the future, the clear distinction between mission planning and execution is expected to be challenged by exploiting battlespace information and predictive capabilities. Proper support is needed to speed up the OODA-loop to outpace the adversary in the planning phase as well as in the execution phase.</p><p>The development and use of a computer-based decision support system that leverages AI, machine learning, wargames/combat simulations and digital twins of the battlespace has the potential to change the military planning and decision-making concept of operations (CONOPS).</p><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown a huge potential for solving planning problems in civilian applications. However, despite its headline success in video games, strategy games and other planning domains over the last few years, RL is not making similar progresses in the realm of wargames/combat simulations for military operations planning. Videogames leave a lot of margin when it comes to critical (life or death) simulation.

In particular, it is essential for Member States' armed forces to provide combat units with increased engagement capabilities without being spotted and with a high level of success and survivability.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) engagement is the capability of firing at a target not directly seen by the effector, based on information given by a remote sensor. The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) capability offers tactical advantages, as mobile units acquire an increased engagement capability with higher kill probability and without being spotted by the adversary.</p><p>To succeed in a BLOS-firing mission, reconnaissance, intelligence, and adequate preparations is likely essential. A technical system design (i.e., incorporating command and control, mobility, survivability, lethality, intelligence and endurance) for BLOS must be versatile against future alterations pending an evolving hostile threat. A BLOS system design therefore needs to be future-proof regarding robustness and security to motivate investments in resources and funds for the anticipated period of life.</p><p>In this context, some requirements are becoming increasingly important: provide the land and coastal combat units with an increased engagement capability and with a very high degree of success and survivability; discriminate between threats that are not always clearly identified and visible before firing; defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment; avoid widespread collateral damage; providing conditions for a high level of survivability by low exposure as well as reachability with precision strikes over an area.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address:</p><ul><li>the development of

There is a need for exchange of classified information in MUS. Identification, authentication and authorisation are important functionalities in the field of digital trusted gateways. Further research needs to be done to overcome the physical characteristics of the underwater environment that limits the possibility of having wireless communication systems with sufficient robustness and bandwidth required by many underwater warfare functions.</p><p>The specific objective is to design and demonstrate feasibility of secured (communications security COMSEC and transmission security TRANSEC) underwater (network) communication solutions (acoustic, optical, or other modalities) for UUSs designed for military needs.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>The proposals must address research of secure underwater communication, with focus on <strong>acoustic</strong> technologies, including networked solutions, that contribute to the improvement of current performance, through the creation of new low-distortion modulation techniques, interference avoidance/suppression mechanisms, recovery from fading, etc. This requires the communication to be highly adaptive and self-reconfigurable. To improve the performance of the acoustic underwater communication channel, the environmental conditions in situ, such as noise, depth, sound velocity profile, etc., must be considered.</p><p>Furthermore, research in underwater communication, with focus on <strong>optical</strong> technologies, must be addressed, with the aim of improving bandwidth and transmission distance, reducing signal distortion, in order to improve communication within and between platforms, networks and infrastructures.</p><p>The security aspects should be included in the underwater communication systems. The challenging communication conditions (low data rate, long latency, delay and Doppler spread effects, highly varying channel conditions and high noise levels, etc), which may result in unreliable and low-bandwidth communication links, also give special challenges for security mechanisms. This should be taken into account in the design of the complete communication system (modulations, network protocols, etc), carefully balancing modular/layered approaches and cross-layer approaches. During the design, performance metrics describing efficiency and robustness should always be assessed, to avoid that this gets too much compromised by the security measures. Also, encryption methods should be considered in order to obtain metrics about its efficiency.

While the main focus of this action is on processes and tools for prevention, detection and analysis of emerging cyber-attacks, it also foresees in particular the acquisition and/or adoption of common (automation) tools, processes and shared data infrastructures for the management and sharing of contextualised and actionable cybersecurity operational information across the EU.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Cross-border SOC platforms will contribute to enhancing and consolidating collective situational awareness and capabilities in detection and CTI, supporting the development of better performing data analytics, detection, and response tools, through the pooling of larger amounts of data, including new data generated internally by the consortia members.</p><p>The platforms should act as a central point allowing for broader pooling of relevant data and CTI, enable the spreading of threat information on a large scale and among a large and diverse set of actors (e.g., CERTs/CSIRTs, ISACs, operators of critical infrastructures).</p><p>Also, for cross-border SOC platforms, there is a crucial need for novel tools based on advanced Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), data analytics and other relevant cybersecurity relevant technologies, based on research results and further tested and validated in real conditions, in combination with access to supercomputing facilities (e.g., to boost the correlation and detection features of cross-border platforms).</p><p>The platforms will support common situational awareness and effective crisis management and response by providing relevant information to networks and entities responsible for cybersecurity operational cooperation and crisis management at Union level, without undue delay, where they obtain information related to an ongoing large-scale, cross-border incident, or to a major threat or a major vulnerability likely to have significant cross-border impacts or significant impacts on services and activities falling within the scope of the Directive (EU) 2022/2555.</p><p>A call for expression of interest will be launched to select entities in Member States that provide the necessary facilities to host and operate Cross-Border SOC platforms for pooling data on cybersecurity threat between several Member States. Applicants to the call for expressions of interest should describe the aims and objectives of the Cross-Border SOC platform, describe its role and how such role relates to other cybersecurity actors, and its eventual cooperation with other public or private cybersecurity stakeholders. Applicants should also provide the detailed planning of the activities and tasks of the Cross-Border SOC platform, the services it will offer, the way they will operate and be operationalised, and describe the duration of the activity as well as the main milestones and deliverables. They should also specify what equipment, tools and services need to be procured and integrated to build up the Cross-Border SOC platform, its services and its infrastructure.</p><p>To support the above activities of a Cross-Border SOC platform, the following two workstreams of activities are foreseen:</p><ul><li><strong><em>[Procurement] A Joint Procurement Action</em></strong> with the Member State participating in the Cross-Border SOC platform: this will cover the procurement of the main equipment, tools and services needed to build up the Cross-Border SOC platform.</li><li><strong><em>[Building up and running the Cross-Border SOC platform]</em></strong> A grant will also be available to cover, among others, the preparatory activities for setting up the Cross-Border SOC platform, its interaction and cooperation with other stakeholders, as well as the running/operating costs involved, enabling the effective operation of the Cross-Border SOC platform, e.g., using the equipment, tools and services purchased through the joint procurement.

Grants will only be awarded to applicants that have succeeded the evaluation of the joint procurement action.</p><p>These actions aim at creating or strengthening cross-border SOCs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the (cyber-)security of national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>",,,,,

Achieving urban mobility decarbonisation can involve a variety of policy and technology measures and solutions. However, technological innovations alone are not sufficient for achieving a decarbonised urban transport system. They should be complemented by measures tapping into changes that target travel patterns and generate a shift in the daily mobility behaviour.</p><p>Urban mobility management plans are developed by organisations in the public domain (by local and regional authorities) and the private domain (companies, organisations, and institutions) to promote sustainable urban transport as laid out in the Urban Mobility Framework<sup>[1]</sup> to reach climate neutrality, reduce congestion, air pollutant emissions, noise and other harmful effects of overreliance on fossil fuels-based transport.</p><p>In the context of consultations for the preparation of the new Urban Mobility Framework, the support for mobility management plans has been voiced, with a majority of the respondents being in favour of adopting those plans by 'travel destination? such as organisers of big events, companies with more than 200 employees, universities, shopping centres/retail areas, primary and secondary schools as well as hospitals.</p><p>It is not clear however how many mobility management schemes exist. When they exist, they seem not always fully taken up by their target users. In consequence, they do not lead to the desired behavioural change resulting in a shift towards sustainable mobility choices. Therefore, projects should identify and address specific bottlenecks and barriers that prevent the uptake of sustainable mobility management schemes across the EU and propose solutions that could lead to the desired behaviour change of citizens, aimed at more sustainable and decarbonised urban transport with all its related co-benefits in view of decarbonising the transport sector in line with the European Green Deal.</p><p>A closely related challenge is the uptake of electromobility that requires an increase for clean electricity and the related infrastructure enhancement, notably distribution grids in cities. It is relevant to promote vehicle-to-grid solutions, to alleviate the needs to invest in distribution grid extension. In this regard, behavioural change is key to enable and incentivise electric vehicles users to participate in balancing the grid through smart and bidirectional charging.</p><p>The objective of this topic is to explore, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of mobility management schemes (influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply) in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system. To this end, projects should:</p><ul><li>Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way and provide an overview of mobility managements schemes in the European urban area in both the public and the private domain, which seek to increase the use of sustainable transport modes infrastructure;</li><li>Identify, analyse and assess leverages as well as barriers in the uptake of mobility management schemes for the most important target groups;</li><li>Co-design with and engaging the organisations proposing the mobility schemes, identify and assess potential behaviour-related solutions to those barriers that ensure a successful uptake of mobility management systems. Those solutions should differentiate between specific target groups, in particular students, employees, customers and patients of relevant categories of organisations: schools, universities, hospitals and other health facilities, tourism and leisure sectors, shopping malls, private companies, living in European urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Identify user groups that are more motivated to change their behaviours and prepared to act as frontrunners, thus leading to a more rapid adoption;</li><li>Propose recommendations that support and incentivise the uptake of sustainable mobility choices by organisations and users;</li><li>Propose recommendations to support the uptake of smart and bidirectional recharging for electric vehicles and related demand side management schemes in cities to enable electric vehicles (EV) participation in electricity markets as active customers that can feed the electricity stored in EV batteries back to the power grid during the peak hours to help balance the growing the electricity demand (thus avoiding need for investments into grids);</li><li>Establish incentives to promote renewable based e-mobility schemes notably smart and bidirectional charging in cities to reduce reliance on fossil fuels including via support and awareness raising schemes;</li><li>Encourage new mobility behaviour by means of marketing, information and awareness raising campaigns.</li></ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

Member States and EDF Associated Countries (MS) have already used various types of MALE RPAS in recent operations to provide detection, identification and communication. MALE RPAS could also have a dual use potential.</p><p>The EU commonly agreed priorities underline the permanent need to track ships, aircraft and other systems across a wide area of airspace by means of interoperable unmanned surveillance systems capable of operating in all and adverse weather conditions and all types of environments, with assured data integrity. To operate in all types of operational environments, RPAS must be integrated into air traffic management (ATM).</p><p>As part of a versatile and robust MALE RPAS, the system should consider the option to incorporate the means for an effective neutralisation of targets that posed a threat to the mission being carried out.</p><p>Today, most of the ISR capabilities of the MS rely on non-EU manufacturers in order to carry out their missions. However, due to the sensitive nature of military operations and the restrictions on technology transfer that prevent MS and EDF Associated Countries from fully benefiting from platform adaptation, the development of a fully European MALE RPAS is key to reduce dependency on non-EU solutions and to ensure sovereignty in this area of ISTAR.</p><p>It is an overarching objective to strengthen European sovereignty in this strategically relevant area. Hence, this topic is expected to result in a step-changing programme in line with the commonly agreed EU defence objectives and ensuring European strategic autonomy and technological competitiveness in a broad sense.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>MALE RPAS reconnaissance includes optical, infrared, radar and signal intelligence sensors and generates geoinformation data. The sensors for optical, infrared and radar reconnaissance are usual configuration parts of a MALE system. As signal intelligence is often classified for national eyes only, it would be preferable to develop a common pod design, which is suitable to contain the national electronics. The integration effort into the MALE system can be shared with a common pod design. This pod design is also a suitable baseline for additional future sensors.</p><p>The ultimate objective is to develop, produce and sustain a system that provides this critical defence capability to respond to future security challenges.</p><p>In addition, a strong European supply chain is intended to be developed at all levels to promote the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) in the long term. The supply chain should not be a pre-determined black box, but is expected to be open to competitive suppliers in a largely open tendering process, with the suppliers for mission-critical or security-relevant systems intended to be EU-based.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address a prototype of a fully European MALE RPAS with an innovative ISTAR and armed ISTAR capability to exceed the capabilities of comparable current systems and the capabilities of systems available at the entry into service time or, at least, be comparable with them. The prototype must be tested with a view to further qualification and certification activities.</p><p>Proposals must also address the design and prototype of a common sensor pod for the European MALE RPAS, without affecting the timeline of ongoing activities related to the development of MALE RPAS.</p><p>In addition, proposals should address the enhancement of a multi-role approach for the MALE RPAS available with different sensor pod configurations.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic,

They form a cornerstone of cyber defence training and testing. The objective of this topic is to take further the ongoing cyber range technology roadmap by designing and implementing next-generation solutions. The key consideration is on the cooperative approach in developing and using those cyber range technologies, thereby facilitating joint capability development.</p><p>Technological investments and developments have so far mostly focused on various fundamental needs such as visualisation, scoring, realistic scenarios, and federation. Separate mature technological building blocks exist in modern cyber and IT solutions. However, these developments have yet to be consolidated into the context of cyber ranges for defence purposes, in a manner such as the PESCO project <em>Cyber Ranges Federation</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to address the remaining challenge on design and development of solutions that deliver notable progress vis-?-vis the current state-of-the-art, including in view of wider technology landscape. This means that focus has to shift from creating cyber ranges that fulfil basic needs to cyber ranges that target next-level capability requirements. Therefore, the specific objective is about the use of cyber ranges for trainings and exercises. The proposed solutions, however, can benefit also other cyber range use-cases such as product development and penetration testing. Therefore, considerations of such use-cases may be taken into account for developing the solutions.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>The next-generation cooperative cyber range capability must address at least the following issues:</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises with classified information, especially for cross-border exercises by EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>Although the use of classified information in national exercises and trainings is not a new phenomenon, it is, firstly, still absent from the capabilities of many nations and, secondly, there is no existing solution that offers an EU-wide, cross-border classified capability. Such a capability could help various countries in using this functionality which they otherwise would not be able to use and it would provide a currently unavailable solution to conducting exercises across nations, including for topics such as information sharing and ensuring confidentiality of related data. This would also benefit the EU's military structure, e.g., EU Military Staff, European Defence Agency and others.</p><p>Moreover, such a capability can be used by nations internally, e.g., for its different security agencies both in defence and national security to increase interoperability.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises covering the entire chain of cyber defence operations from planning through conduct up to review, including by utilising realistic mission networks. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>Most large-scale technical cyber exercises that are currently conducted do not sufficiently cover all relevant aspects of cyberspace operations. While such aspects are sometimes covered in non-technical exercises, these tend to not sufficiently well incorporate technical cyber defence teams. As a result, truly comprehensive and effective exercises are difficult to deliver.</p><p>The aspects that surround these technical activities (e.g., operation planning, legal considerations) and which complement incident management (e.g., intelligence activities) require different scenarios and different technical exercise environments in comparison to existing capabilities. The latter also includes the challenge of creating realistic federated mission networks for training purposes.</p><p>Key aspects in this entire chain are also the analysis of the performance of the cyber operators and the scoring of cyber security situational awareness.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence throughout the delivery of trainings and exercises (e.g., for Blue, Red, White and Green Teams) </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>The use of AI in different phases and parts of cyber exercises and trainings has been researched and developed to an extent. This includes, for example, AI-based scenario generation, and AI-based Red/Blue Teams with hybrid skills (human + AI-based attack/defend strategies (developed in different private companies). AI also plays a pivotal role in generating comprehensive situational awareness for the development of realistic federated missions.</p><p>In the area of federated missions, which employ multiple teams operating from different locations, AI technologies could help to identify the operational deficiencies within each team member, informing subsequent training customisation and generating tailored scenarios.</p><p>It is clear that AI can assist in these and in other parts of cyber capability development. The proposals are expected to provide AI-based solutions that target all major parts of cyber exercise and training delivery, as well as AI-based solutions for the performance evaluation of the trainees using the hybrid skills.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises that leverage the concept of digital twins. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>Digital twins as a concept has a long history. The use of such solutions in cyber exercises has also been targeted previously but not with results that have been sufficiently persistent or useful. Therefore, the challenge remains on developing digital twins or other high-fidelity simulations that have a reasonable cost-effectiveness - given that a common dilemma in such simulations is finding a balance between cost of creating such digital copies and the learning impact that those simulations can offer on top of more standardised ways for IT/OT system and network simulations. One possible avenue for successful balancing of these requirements may be witnessed in the space domain, given its increased need for simulations and testing.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Develop or facilitate a framework for accreditation of training centres and personnel skill levels. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>The solutions should include a proposal on how to establish certified practices for accreditation of training centres (cyber ranges) and skill levels (personal and team certificates). The solution should take into account EU-wide accreditation schemes. However, these should allow for national specificities. Where possible, existing standards, such as relevant NATO practices, should be used.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Cross-cutting items</strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>All solutions must address the <strong>challenge of sharing and pooling cyber range capabilities </strong>in a coordinated manner between cyber range providers. This challenge may be best addressed by using and enhancing existing initiatives and projects. Moreover, this sharing and pooling can be demonstrated, for example, via the implementation of the project's solutions in different cyber ranges through federation. If federation as an approach is used, it is expected that the proposals also cover the business and management side of the federation. This could, for example, formalise in the development of model cooperation agreements that mimic actual needs and have been developed with processes similar to actual processes (twin environments).</p><p>Where existing or new cyber range and cyber exercise standards (e.g., for scenario development and game net creation) are covered, the proposal must address the challenge of achieving a wide user-based of the standard. Proposing the use of any such standards without clearly addressing the way forward may invalidate the whole part of the proposal related to such standards because the success of a standard is as much dependent on the community as the standard's actual content.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this

Therefore, the main objective of this topic is to identify, define, design, and develop them, to be integrated on future European naval platforms.</p><p>The topic should act as a real enabler for both the European naval industry and the EU Navies. In that context, it should be very inclusive to be adapted to the most European Navies' needs for their future naval platforms. It will allow EU Navies to remain at the forefront of technology, to maximise interoperability and the survivability by design, to operate with technological superiority, and to increase EU strategic autonomy. At industrial level, this topic should be an instrument for the European industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to define the common operational requirements of the System of Systems (SoS) framework and the essential elements of the next generation of European naval platforms. Such a SoS framework is expected to embrace the supporting infrastructure including interfaces, data, and common and specific services. It must identify the technological needs for the future development of European naval platforms with special attention on emerging technologies, promising solutions, and the increased resilience of naval vessels when facing the most sophisticated threats by near real-time evaluation of survivability.</p><p>In particular, the topic should contribute to solve these specific challenges:</p><ul><li>The capability to operate interconnected in a fully integrated way, under challenging multi-domain (i.e., land, aerial, surface, subsurface and cyber) threat conditions.</li><li>The definition and the design of the core architecture of the future European naval platforms by a SoS approach.</li><li>The analysis of naval vessels survivability aspects on an operational level, considering its three key aspects (i.e., susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability) under an integral approach, leading to a resilient ship.</li></ul><p>This topic aims to identify and define essential elements for future European naval platforms as functional system building blocks by specifying a full set of new technologies, solutions, and systems to be fitted on board, covering the following main areas:</p><ul><li>Four pillars:</li><li><strong>Combat System.</strong> New threats based on emerging technologies lead to the development of combat systems with enhanced sensors collaborating under an extended top-side concept that increase the detection capability, in time and accuracy, as well as new weapons/effectors able to face them, based on decision making algorithms to allow shorter reaction time to engage those threats. The UxVs are to be integrated into the Combat System as an extension of the detection and defence capability. In terms of survivability, specific challenges to susceptibility are the required countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, together with the ability to predict and manage where a missile or a torpedo might impact the vessel, as an important interface between susceptibility and vulnerability. UxVs should be also analysed in relation to ship survivability.</li><li><strong>Communication and Information System. </strong>Solutions need to be sought to meet emerging challenges in this area such as the management of a big volume of data transmitted at high speed (comparable to 5G and ahead) in a very demanding operational theatre, the integrity and cybersecurity of the data, and the EU naval tactical cloud integrated in a military multidomain operations cloud. Special consideration should be made on anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) scenarios, defining embarked cloud capabilities to support the edge operation of joint forces overseas. Attention must also be paid to complete loss of connectivity due to denial or due to stealth reasons.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Platform Management System</strong>. New threats and evolving technologies should lead to redefine the current concept of naval platforms to ensure enough and adequate power generation, as well as a proper top-side compatible with new weapons and UxV launch and recovery systems (LARS) on board. In the same way, future naval platforms should address efficient platform control and management, as well as increased power supply needs for future weapons and sensors, and new energy technologies to achieve the European Green Deal objectives. In addition, ship signature management, smart damage control, and survivability aspects should be considered because countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, or the impact of hypersonic missile or torpedo affect the vulnerability of the platform (e.g., a successful hard-kill engagement might result in debris hitting the ship, the success soft-kill deployments strongly affect the ship signatures). The impact of such events should be studied, and technical solutions to withstand the physical and system damage should be identified.</li><li><strong>Navigation System.</strong> Solutions should be sought for increased safety during navigation, independent satellite positioning system, accurate inertial navigation system, autonomous operations and multi-manned and unmanned, underwater, surface, and aerial vehicles coordinated navigation.</li><li>One transversal area linked to the four pillars:</li><li><strong>Survivability Advisory System Foundation</strong>. The evolving threat landscape should result in a need for an advisory capability to assist in the setting of the ship signature management system, the deployment of hard-kill and soft-kill countermeasures, the adjustment of the ship's signature for hit-point management, the post-hit damage assessment, the remaining capability including strength and systems, and the deployment of recovery actions to regain functionality. This should also allow for future task group advisory capabilities, where high value assets should be protected by the task group, and the survivability of the task group is expected to be optimised due to advice across the task group.</li></ul><p>Proposals should design a SoS framework: Solutions should be sought based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution, that might sustain the above-mentioned areas. It should include transversal capabilities like for instance, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Based Decision Making, Digital Twin, Federated Mission Networking, Through-Life Support based on virtual reality and remote systems monitoring, Cyberwarfare, or Survivability</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address:</p><ul><li>The definition of common operational requirements of the essential elements for the future European naval platforms, covering the main areas (i.e., Combat System, Communication and Information System, Enhanced Platform Management System and Navigation System) under an integral survivability approach (i.e., Survivability Advisory System Foundation);</li><li>The development of a concept of a SoS framework, typically based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution that might sustain the concerned areas;</li><li>The definition of a modular, interoperable, scalable, and flexible concept design to support an architecture that should provide a versatile solution for answering future Navies? needs and trends;</li><li>The identification of emerging technologies that should respond to the operational needs of the future naval platforms, including integrated operational data-, messaging-, telecom-communication systems;</li><li>The design of a tool for the management of the ship signature while advising on the status and solutions for timely and accurate deployment of countermeasures, both active (e.g., advanced jammers, signature manipulators) and passive (e.g., flares, chaff, corner cubes), coordinated with hard-kill solutions, and including the prediction and management of the hit-point;</li><li>The assessment of existing solutions and the consideration of new damage control systems where appropriate through automated systems, crew actions, and recovery of systems, while performing predictions of the state of the ship after incidents, likely based on AI that processes sensor readings/information and imaging;</li><li>The design of an operational guidance system to support the Navigation System for ship operations with a damaged and undamaged ship (e.g., advice for helicopter operations, UxV deployment);</li><li>The identification of the priorities on technologies to be further develop in the future, as well as the level of maturity to be achieved for the associated elements;</li><li>The analysis of a tool for the European naval industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies;</li><li>The operational assessment and the analysis of the technical viability, as well as the evaluation of the feasibility of the baseline concepts;</li><li>The design of a joint technology demonstrator and to de-risk potential further activities in the future.</li></ul><p>In addition, the proposals should substantiate synergies and complementarities, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with activities described in previous call topics under

These types of assets and the technologies that go with them have the potential to offer a diverse mission set, minesweeping being one of them. The maritime drones and their payloads currently used and integrated by the navies operate with different levels of autonomy and endurance. This topic aims to enhance naval minesweeping capabilities by pushing the design and level of the autonomy of particularly maritime drones. Furthermore, this topic addresses sweep gear and sweep sources for minesweeping operations adjoining the higher level of autonomy. In this context the drone/platform and its payload/sweeping gear form the minesweeping system.</p><p>Minesweeping is traditionally performed using mechanical or influence sweep sources towed behind a highly specialised and expensive crewed platform (minesweeper). Evolving technologies, such as autonomous features, offer new solutions to the minesweeping systems. These solutions in concert with new operational concepts offer European navies the opportunity to maximise the benefits of common development. Typically, a distinction can be made between drones with towed signature sources and those with integrated sources installed aboard.</p><p>The size and capability of a minesweeping drone and its payload are defined by the operational needs. These needs vary in environmental aspects from inshore operations with short transit and limited operation times in sheltered areas to operations in unsheltered areas potentially exposed to heavy wind and large waves with long standoff distances. The variation in operational needs with respect to the subject of protection can be from smaller merchant vessels and military vessels with reduced underwater signatures to large civilian merchants with significant underwater signatures.</p><p>The underwater signature and the shock resistance of the minesweeping system is a crucial part of its design and a fundamental feature of minesweeping operations.</p><p>The objective of this call is to reach at least technology readiness level 6 for a minesweeping system (platform/drone and payload designed for it).</p><span>Scope:</span><p>The proposals must target minesweeping systems (platform/drone and payload/sweeping gear) with autonomous features that are capable of performing influence sweeping in open-sea conditions against mines that target large merchant vessels (such as Landing Platform Dock (LPD), Ro-Ro vessels etc. up to around 200m length). The proposals must investigate and develop capable and cost-effective drone systems for influence minesweeping. This includes the interfaces to enabling systems such as launch and recovery (LARS) of the sweep system and command and control (C2) systems (including planning and evaluation tools).</p><p>The proposals may include solutions that include modified mechanical minesweeping operations.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposals must address reducing time (improved effectiveness) and risk for personnel and materiel in minesweeping operations. Development of uncrewed systems and autonomous features are seen as enablers in this regard. Improvements must address at least vehicle design regarding underwater signatures, propulsion system, and shock resistance to benefit both operational quality and efficiency.

They also need to be able to both operate cross-domain capabilities, such as any-sensor-to-any-shooter networking, and prevent the enemy from doing so. This requires communications systems that can perform ad hoc networking in all domains in dynamically evolving tactical situations. Currently, this is done with mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) data links.</p><p>As wireless solutions such as the Internet of Battlefield Things proliferate, the electromagnetic spectrum is likely to become an increasingly important source of situational awareness. Passive electronic monitoring, detection, classification and localisation of enemy radio frequency emitters is part of the recognised situational picture. Traditionally, this has been the task of electronic warfare (EW) units and their specific equipment providing electronic support (ES) to combat units.</p><p>To counter a detected threat, forces can use kinetic- (KE) and directed-energy (DE) means with their weapon systems, or electronic protection (EP) and attack (EA) if they have jamming systems, traditionally equipment carried and used by dedicated EW units. Before directing fire at detected targets, soldiers must mitigate the risk of friendly fire. At long ranges and in poor visibility, this requires radio communications with either self-positioning based Blue Force Tracking (BFT) or interrogation-based Identification Friend or Foe (IFF).</p><p>Today, MANET data links, ES receivers, jammers, BFT and IFF are separate pieces of equipment requiring decentralised control, separate installation space, power supply, cabling, antennas, etc. By combining these functionalities into a single autonomously controlled equipment, it would be possible to achieve better performance, higher reliability, lower weight and lower life cycle costs.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned technological reasons for converged aperture, there is also a need for converged systems. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is expected to continue to be contested, congested and constrained. Military use of the EMS is under serious pressure from the civil community. Civilian, dual-use and military applications intermingle in the EMS currently in use, challenging the freedom and security of operation (OPSEC) of military users. With Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, systems are likely to be able to dynamically perform mission and threat analysis, situational awareness, positioning and navigation, and jamming. This means dynamic adaptation to prevailing conditions at machine speed. This would require AI-based operation at the device and system of systems (fleet/network) level in order to coordinate actions of several systems with minimal detectability and platform losses.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to design, develop and build a system that should:</p><ul><li>Accelerate command and control (C2) and enhance operational effectiveness by providing cross-domain mobile ad-hoc networking capabilities to the armed forces.</li><li>Increase lethality by enabling faster firing and reducing the risk of collateral damages, including fratricide, by providing the means to detect and target the enemy and to locate, track and identify friendly forces.</li><li>Reduce enemy lethality and increase own protection by avoiding detection with AI-based emission control, stealthy waveforms and by jamming enemy communications.</li><li>Provide autonomous mission management of several systems (including detection, jamming and targeting) within the network in order to improve survivability, and autonomously take actions to meet the mission objectives with the aid of AI.</li><li>Be capable of operating in all weather conditions, in particular in the challenging Arctic environment and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied areas.</li></ul><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address study, development and qualification of new generation scalable and cognitive (AI-controlled) multifunctional software defined (SD) transceiver for military use in manned and unmanned platforms.

It is continuously being developed through standardisation activities in 3GPP, and new releases with extended features of the standard are approved approximately every 18 to 24 months.</p><p>To ensure a technological edge in military use of 5G, it is important to capitalise on the continued momentum of new releases and associated features relevant for military operations. In 2016, resilience in civil communication systems was listed by NATO as one of seven baseline requirements that each Member State should measure their level of preparedness. In November 2019, this requirement was updated by NATO Defence Ministers, who stressed the need for reliable communications including 5G.</p><p>To address this statement and ensure a higher degree of robustness and resilience in military operations when operating in the tactical edge, the militaries should be able to exploit and seamlessly interact with civilian infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted services for tactical command and control applications.</p><p>This topic focuses on system level integration and orchestration of 5G technologies for seamless interaction of private military and public 5G networks. Hence, the overall objective is to support the need for an always connected concept enabling military applications to roam securely through a mix of private and public networks. To achieve this, there is a need to study, develop and demonstrate how the military can exploit seamless and uninterrupted transfer of secure applications and services in a coverage area served by a mix of private military and public 5G networks, including BLoS (Beyond Line of Sight) through Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) communication systems integrated in 3GPP standard.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific challenge of this topic is to demonstrate robust and dynamic operational capabilities of 5G connectivity solutions matching the military needs for tactical command and control applications and services.</p><p>The solution should always be connected via a hybrid form of networks, while ensuring secure communications, using tactical networks, private military and public 5G networks and other federation solutions. The use of flexible reach back solutions such as 5G NTN is also necessary to reach shared centralised cloud services.</p><p>Within this context, secure integration of commercial and military hardware, software and services is a fundamental challenge that must be addressed on both a technological and a commercial level.</p><span>Scope:</span><p>Proposals must address the development of either integrated private-public 5G system architectures for military operations, or private military 5G networks, or public 5G services for military applications.</p><p>Moreover, proposals should lead to the development and demonstration of case-agnostic technical products and services, applicable to military operations across all dimensions of warfare.

Materials such as reinforced concrete, polymers, composites, and concrete-steel/composite-steel hybrids systems have demonstrated some advantages such as reduced costs.

This is particularly acute in the event of disruption in the transport, power, water supply and communication sectors in highly populated and industrialised areas, or when such events raise the likelihood of cascading effects with severe impacts on communities and the economy that are hard or impossible to predict. The main focus on NaTech risks lies on a thorough understanding of the vulnerability of industrial sites and critical infrastructure, and the potential impact natural hazards can have on such technological resources. This entails the identification of both physical (safety of building facilities and structures) and operational vulnerabilities, often addressing multi-hazard conditions. Innovative methods are required for analysing worst-case scenarios, and informing decision-makers about the crosscutting and shared responses to different crises given available resources.</p><p>Research involving multiple fields of expertise, including spatial information (to be specified), is also required to improve hi-tech capacities for operational response systems to better cope with natural and/or technological disasters occurring in Europe (and in overseas territories) in an integrated manner.

For example, the initial effects from a nuclear explosion in a city will lead to, besides numerous dead and severely injured citizens, destroyed infrastructure. The radioactive plume containing particulate matter may damage ventilation systems and fallout will generate high dose rates. Criticality or other incidents at nuclear power plants and nuclear-powered vessels may occur because of direct attack, sabotage, collateral damage, accidents, loss of infrastructure services such as power and/or water supply or lack of necessary skilled personnel on site. </p><p>Research on large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion need to be undertaken both separately as well as in a RN-perspective. Research activities aimed at updating EU's possibilities for large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion would benefit from being carried out in close cooperation with other EU-members. Research activities should also pertain to improved understanding of the radioactive fallout and assessment of dose rates to the population following a nuclear explosion in order to enable use of cost-effective sustainable technologies in protection of population and infrastructures.</p><p>In a situation after a RN-incident the time consuming and laborious decontamination procedures for the population must be reduced to a minimum. Therefore, the possibility to identifying the need for decontamination, and above all to assess that there is no need for decontamination would be beneficial as well as the possibility to enter a shelter or other protected area in a safe way.</p><p>Protective measures in the aftermath of a RN disaster may vary depending on situations. Such measures should be based on evaluated risks rather than probabilities. Starting with sensor- as well as other available data, measures could be optimized from a risk-cost point-of-view resulting in cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Based on measurement data, appropriate protective actions could be decided upon. If a risk analysis results in a low risk, a lower level of mitigating measures might be needed resulting in lower costs. Then resources can be used in other areas where they are more needed, leading to an overall optimized protection.</p><p>Protective actions should be based on risk modelling. Such modelling is based on available knowledge of different input quantities resulting in a probability distribution, from which the risk can be calculated applying a consequence function.</p><p>New technologies should be compatible with RN crisis management systems, strategies for crisis communication and take into account relevant societal and human factors, such as vulnerable group and cultural and linguistic diversities. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The action should take due consideration to EU policies, in particular the SevesoIII and CER Directives.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research/innovation activities.</p><p>Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances.</p>",,,,,

Any cryptographic primitive based on the integer factorization and/or the discrete logarithm problems will be vulnerable to large-scale quantum-powered attacks. The digital data/products/systems that derive their security ultimately from the abovementioned primitives will be compromised and must be upgraded - including their replacement when needed- to quantum-resistant cryptography. The massive scale of this foreseen upgrade shows that preparations are needed today in order to widely implement the relevant mitigations in the future. Many companies and governments cannot afford to have their protected communications/data decrypted in the future, even if that future still seems distant. There is a need to advance swiftly in the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.</p><p>Post-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms should be deployable in a dynamic manner in order to quickly react to new quantum computer developments.

This should be done under the premises of feed and food as a critical infrastructure and risks pertaining therein;</li><li>In addition to raising awareness, proposals should develop possible preparedness, mitigation and response plans for national authorities and the private sector. </li></ul><span>Scope:</span><p>Plant and animal health is of global importance for sustainable agriculture and competitive agriculture and forestry, as well as for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems<sup>[1]</sup>. Globally, between 10 and 28 percent of crop production is lost to pests and contamination of food and feed by mycotoxins can severely threaten the health of humans and livestock. The International Year of Plant Health (IYPH) 2020, established by the United Nations, raised public and political awareness of the importance of plant health and a recent study (IPPC, 2021) calls the attention of policy makers to the main effects of climate change on plant health, helping governments and the international community addressing plant health challenges. Also, the food chain, from harvest of agricultural products, throughout processing, distribution and until consumption can be challenged by several (hybrid) threats, which are increasingly taking non-conventional forms and possibly targeting the agriculture and food chain with severe consequences.</p><p>The Word Health Organisation identified intentional agriculture attack with biological weapons and food contamination as one of the main global public health threats of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The potential for terrorist attacks or other criminal actions against agri-food targets is increasingly recognised as a threat to international security. The population's health could be jeopardised by the manipulation of communicable diseases or the contamination of food, soil, air and drinking water by CBR agents. These risks have been studied and documented by a Network of excellence (Plant and Food Biosecurity) funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (PLANTFOODSEC).</p><p>In 2017, the ENVI Committee (Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the EU Parliament) has defined food defence as <em>'the protection of food from intentional contamination or adulteration by biological, chemical, physical or radiological agents. It includes measures regarding prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery form intentional acts of food contamination?. </em>The potential impact on human health of deliberate sabotage of agricultural crops, seed or food can be estimated by extrapolation from the many documented examples of unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease.</p><p>Current EU capabilities to detect and respond to agro-terrorism and bio-criminal acts are dispersed across different national practitioners, normally handled by regional or national bodies and are very limited in terms of coordination. Different countries have different governmental authorities for agricultural and feed and food domains, different collaborative networks, different border controls, different inspection bodies and different regulatory references and reporting mechanisms as well as different investigative bodies in the case of suspected feed/food crime. The EU institutions have to start to consider the agri-food chain as a critical infrastructure which can suffer from attacks and which need to be protected. The most effective way to accomplish this goal is through international cooperation by a multi-sectorial approach combing different expertise, such as from law enforcement, the feed and food sector and health emergency services.</p><p>The main challenge is to increase the resilience of European agricultural production, feed and food processing and distribution chain in case of sudden shocks. Agriculture and food chains will be included as an important dimension to be analysed in the context of protection of European critical entities<sup>[2]</sup> in case of emergencies. It is also crucial to address the interrelations between the food chain shocks and different types of critical entities with the objective of developing tools and methods to minimize cascading effects and allow rapid recovery of service performance levels after incidents. In the new context also the interaction with climate change, global trade and internet trade (spreading often plant material not controlled at all and of low quality) need to be taken into consideration. Artificial intelligence provides new tools for better coping with many of the most important challenges.</p><p>In this context, research should address agri-food systems shocks, taking account of the increasing effects of climate change and global trade (and their interaction) on pest outbreaks and spread, feed/food commodity shocks, due to external challenges, feed/food supply chains interruption and organised agri-food terrorism attacks.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is also encouraged.</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic as well as with the successful proposal(s) under topic <em>HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-02: Soil pollution processes - modelling and inclusion in advanced digital decision-support tools</em> should be envisaged to avoid duplication, and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>[1] For R&amp;I on plant and animal health as well as on agro-biodiversity please consult further topics under the Cluster 6 Work Programme.</p><p>[2] Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the resilience of critical entities (COM(2020) 829 final.</p>",,,,,

To respond to these emerging challenges an integrated transnational emergency management is needed efficiently linking systems available at the European level such as, for example, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, with national, regional or local systems. Furthermore, an evaluation of applied disaster risk reduction methods is required, in particular alert and impact forecasting systems, to identify potential for improvement and constant innovation.</p><p>Knowledge transfer (cross-border and cross-sectoral) about natural hazards-related risks and emergency management is essential to increase the resilience of societies. A vital dialogue and exchange of good practice examples among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policymakers and local communities is needed. In particular, the level of awareness of EU citizens for local risks can be increased by new approaches to visualise risks, vulnerability and exposure through e.g. impact forecasting data and mapping including satellite data and information. Emergency management plays a crucial role in this regard, taking into account the ongoing urbanization and economic growth, which put a lot of pressure on areas such as floodplains and their ability to absorb and store water.</p><p>Currently, there are no harmonised / standardised European methods for identifying vulnerability and exposure on the basis of which alert and impact forecasting systems are established, allowing this information to be used by civil protection authorities in a timely manner to improve disaster preparedness, communication to local authorities and population, evaluation logistics etc. Recent flash floods in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg in July 2021 have shown that this lack of protocols hampered the efficient implementation of early warning and preparedness actions prior to the disaster event.</p><p>This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme. Proposals should include a work package, means and resources for coordination with complementary projects funded under the Science for Society element of the ESA FutureEO programme. The projects(s) should establish a close coordination and collaboration with the relevant ESA relevant actions and projects (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eo4society.esa.int"">https://eo4society.esa.int</a>).</p><p>In this context it is important to remind that standardisation should support operations and policymaking to supplement it but should by no means substitute it. While standardisation of technology may be more straightforward, the right balance does especially have to be sought for processes. The action should ensure close synergies with standardisation activities on European and international level.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research/innovation activities.</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is also encouraged.</p>",,,,,

These methods have proven very effective in understanding offender behaviour and interaction of online service providers, and have ultimately facilitated the shutting down of communication channels used by these offenders, as well as their prosecution. An increasingly important need for Police Authorities' activity in these spaces is the ability to effectively infiltrate particularly dangerous online groups of offenders, while making sure that the evidence obtained will be admissible in court. EU values and fundamental rights shall stay in the core of any future measures. Research in this area should tackle legislative frameworks to collecting evidence in online, including undercover, investigations of child sexual abuse, leading to guidelines and manuals that would make the capability available across the EU to target these offenders more effectively. The results of this research topic (training, manuals guidelines) should be shared among all European Police Authorities, notably via CEPOL, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding under this topic. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as create synergies with similar on-going security research projects from the Calls 2021-2022 on Fighting Crime and Terrorism in the area of digital forensics and countering child sexual abuse, in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>Since the use of undercover agents online could be beneficial in other crime areas too, particularly in counter terrorism, analysis of possibilities for the developed approaches to be adapted to these other crime areas would be welcome. Special care needs to be given to ethics and fundamental rights protection throughout the research and the solutions proposed.

Telecommunication networks, transport networks, aviation, energy, water grids, finance are the backbone of today's society. Due to their exceptional complexity and size, infrastructure networks pose a specific challenge when it comes to identifying different risks, either cyber or physical. Especially in the cyber-domain, many intrusions or attacks remain unnoticed or are detected relatively late. Technological developments in areas like machine learning for analytics, user interfaces as well as storage applications have the potential to improve related capabilities.</p><p>Modern urban environments and interconnected infrastructures create constantly big amounts of data. In addition, other sources can be exploited to support the identification and analysis of risks to infrastructures. Therefore, research on enhanced risk anticipation through real-time data analysis has the potential to lead to useful tools to enhance preparedness (contingency plans, scenario-based exercises, allocation of resources, etc.).</p><p>Resilience of smart cities is marked by a set of specific requirements taking into account most notably aspects from the integration considering user centred approaches as well as social and ethical aspects of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), AI/ Machine Learning approaches for real-time data analytics, ensuring transparency, sufficient knowledge and their operational challenges in this area.</p><p>While the availability of larger amounts of data from different sources offers potential to improve the identification of possible risks to infrastructures, it also increases the demand for fast and resilient analytical tools. There is a need to filter information to identify data that is relevant as an indicator for risks and - given the large number of different forms of cyber-attacks or intrusions - also a need to prioritise and decide according to the degree of danger they present. This implies the need for matching data in the appropriate context and verifying the source with a view of ensuring that only relevant data is analysed, thus avoiding false results. Faster identification and localisation of hazardous agents and contaminants inside the infrastructure networks is a key to allow for quick response, inform and involve citizens and residents as well as avoid large-scale damage of any incident. Such identification capabilities can be deployed as part of the infrastructure and integrate with the systems public authorities use to make sure information is available as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop methods for better cooperation between different actors to ensure a common understanding and interpretation of data and to provide interactive tools for exchange and visualisation for decision support. Cooperation between different public and private actors is essential in this regard.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.</p>",,,,,

This change in urban areas in Europe, brings new opportunities but also new threats for the authorities and their relationship with the citizens and residents. It is therefore critical for the resilience of our urban areas and for their citizens' wellbeing that those services are trusted and secure.</p><p>The classical large-scale infrastructures have a long tradition of implementing the principles of Safety-by-design and Security-by-design when planning their assets. However, with more and more infrastructures on the local level becoming vulnerable, security research can support their protection with new approaches in 'Security-by-design'<sup>[1]</sup>. In view of limited budgets of many local administrations, improved knowledge as well as innovative security upgrades and processes for existing urban infrastructures equipped with advanced connectivity technologies and cooperative systems could be explored.</p><p>EU territories, despite their size and location, suffer from a lack of dedicated EU sovereign and trusted tools in order to enhance the coordination of local first responders and to improve security coverage, such as the preparation of operational staff, field intervention and predictive tools. Even though some complicated tools already exist, it is clear that there is no generic, cost effective and easy to use solutions for local authorities. Therefore, there is a need for creation of new tools that are designed in a simple manner and deployed in an effective way.</p><p>Resilient and secure urban planning tools for the development of holistic approaches that network the different organizational levels, sensor and communication levels and data rooms are very pertinent. These tools should assess the resilience of urban and peri urban territories, identify weaknesses and recommend changes to organizational processes, sensors and communication infrastructure. The secure urban and rural living spaces, technical solutions, organizational levels, and data rooms must be more closely linked. There is a clear need for a development of tools for recovery strategies and proactive foresight for urban and peri urban environments. The tactical tools should include modelling of urban centres and rural areas, predictive tools, improved global situational awareness and day-to-day planning and crisis management (e.g., simulation, training).</p><p>The proposals should include a high level of confidence in data management and sharing, provide solutions on cybersecurity issues and take on board new type of threats. The proposed solutions should suggest trusted shared architectures, trusted data collection, secure computation on the data and management processes, modelling capabilities, hypervisor supporting global situational awareness with open and trusted API's, trusted data processing engines and, e.g., artificial intelligence tools.

Part of the complexity of these phenomena lies in the fact that there is neither a single pathway to radicalisation nor a single terrorist profile. Support of extremists is an effect of individual clusters of psychological, personal, social, economic and political reasons. From a gender perspective, women's radicalisation and involvement in violent extremist groups remain relatively under-researched, poorly understood and possibly characterized by misconceptions about women's exclusion from decision-making processes, as well as their significant underrepresentation in bodies countering the phenomena. In situations of conflict and violence, women are often seen as passive, victims, subordinate and maternal, while these could be assumptions reinforcing gender stereotypes. In order to improve understandings of radicalization and gender we need to study how and why gender norms appear as an increasingly contested area of politics with strong mobilizing power. What role gender norms and equality policies play in stabilizing and destabilizing social and political order, and how ideas and norms about gender equality make people react, mobilize and engage politically, at present, in the past and in the future. The entry point for prevention and de-radicalisation efforts are local communities, which are both stakeholders and partners of the law enforcement in this process. Activities aimed at youngsters and adults have to be gender sensitive, and research has to deliver tailored advice and solutions adequately, and proportionately addressing all critical issues.</p><p>Community policing with its multidisciplinary approach seeks the cooperation of local communities and the broad range of public authorities in its efforts of building safe environments. However, those efforts should recognise not only cultural, social and economic diversity of the milieus, but as mentioned above also be gender sensitive. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as seek to exploit potential synergies with the successful proposal(s) funded under HORIZON-CL3-2023-FCT-01-03<em>: New methods and technologies in service of community policing and transferable best practices, </em>and HORIZON-CL2-2024-DEMOCRACY-01-05: <em>Gender-roles in extremist movements and their impact on democracy</em>.</p><p>Moreover, the EU Counter-Terrorism Agenda adopted in 2020 outlines that Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) will identify best practices and approaches of community policing and engagement to build trust with and among communities, thus research under this topic should also build upon the work done by RAN. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.</p>",,,,,

With the raise of crime-as-a-service market, and growth in the number of connected transactions, use of cryptocurrency as one of the money laundering typology better tracing of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to keep the ground in the fight against crime and terrorism. On top of it all, clandestine cryptocurrency activities are increasingly facilitated by new developments such as high privacy decentralised exchanges, which while used by perpetrators frustrate the efforts of Police Authorities to detect and recover criminal assets as well as to prevent fraudulent transactions. The future of cryptocurrencies and the extent to which criminals and terrorists will use them will depend on factors such as anonymity, future regulation, law enforcement activities and security of the systems.

Undermining the fundamental values of the EU, such as respect for human dignity, freedom and equality. Under EU law, racist and xenophobic hate motivated crime and speech are illegal. The Framework Decision on combating certain forms of expressions of racism and xenophobia<sup>[1]</sup> requires the criminalisation of public incitement to violence or hatred based on race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. The Commission's policies address also specific forms of hate speech and hate crime against groups and communities<sup>[2]</sup> (e.g., antisemitism<sup>[3]</sup>, anti-Muslim hatred or anti-gypsyism<sup>[4]</sup>, hate speech and hate crime relating to gender and sexual orientation<sup>[5]</sup>. In 2021, the European Commission adopted a Communication<sup>[6]</sup> which prompts a Council decision to extend the current list of EU crimes in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to all forms of hate crime and hate speech. Since 2016, the Commission's efforts in countering hate speech and hate crime also involve dedicated exchanges and tools in support to national authorities in the context of the High Level Group on combating hate speech and hate crime.</p><p>Addressing hate speech from all angles increases the chance of combating it in a sustainable manner. Thus, in line with all the above initiatives and with the Victims Rights Directive<sup>[7]</sup> and the EU Strategy on Victims' Rights<sup>[8]</sup>, the successful proposal is expected to reinforce hate crime training and capacity building for Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners, in particular to enhance their tools and methods for lawful detection, reporting and data/evidence collection and analysis of the hate speech related activities that are considered as crime or could lead to a crime, notably the ones supported by advanced digital technologies, such as in emerging cyber environments. By doing so, being an innovation action, the successful proposal is expected to build on previously developed tools for related applications (such as text and image matching). The successful proposal should also support the implementation of the voluntary Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online that the European Commission initiated in 2016 with IT companies, the European strategy for a better internet for kids<sup>[9]</sup>, the Digital Services Act<sup>[10]</sup> and the outcomes of the ""Study on digital violent right-wing extremist content and manifestations of hate speech online?<sup>[11]</sup>. Similarly, any other relevant development, study or initiative should be taken into account. Evolutions in hate crime and hate speech, such as their sparks in times of social or economic crises (e.g. pandemics and wars) should be considered too. In order to derive effective responses and improve the understanding of the cultural and societal aspects of hate speech and hate crime, as well as of the key challenges for combating it, the successful proposal should include local, national and international dimensions, civil society perspectives, and analysis of good practices<sup>[12]</sup>. An added value of the proposal would be to also develop modern and effective awareness raising campaigns for relevant Civil Society Organisations and Police Authorities in order to pass key messages to potential victims, as well as wide communities, while taking into account European multicultural dimension.</p><p>The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects, including the ones funded under topics: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: <em>Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised</em>), HORIZON-CL2-2021-DEMOCRACY-01-03: <em>Feminisms for a new age of democracy</em>, HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-04: <em>Education for democracy</em>, HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05: <em>Evolution of political extremism and its influence on contemporary social and political dialogue</em> and HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-08: <em>Strengthening racial, ethnic and religious equality</em>.

IoT devices increasingly benefit from the convergence and integration of technologies, such as machine learning, real-time analytics as well as 5G that will provide faster and more reliable connections for all devices.</p><p>There are a number of implications particular to IoT devices, which have been consistently highlighted by researchers and Police Authorities. For example, the vulnerability of IoT devices may be exploited by criminals who seek to collect personal data, compromise user credentials or spy on organisations or people. Furthermore, IoT devices may represent a threat that goes beyond the digital world, i.e. they may become an increasingly physical threat, since they find applications in, e.g., industry and infrastructure, as well as in building smart cities. Malevolent actions against connected devices with direct physical impact (e.g. car-to-car communication, hacking of vehicles, hospitals, nuclear plants) are also a growing concern.</p><p>Therefore, the successful proposal should help Police Authorities understand the implications of the fast-developing IoT environment in order to keep pace with the evolution of its applications, recognise and tackle the emerging (digital and especially physical) threats that this may pose.</p><p>At the same time, IoT proliferation will provide opportunities for the Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners to collect a new range of data in relation with criminal activities.

Gains from major breakthroughs in key capacity digital technological areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, data analytics, virtual worlds, photonics, quantum, cloud and edge computing, and others) cannot materialise if there are not enough people with adequate knowledge to develop, deploy and use those digital technologies and their related applications. Evidence from the Structured Dialogue on digital education and skills with Member States shows that a majority of Member States expressed concerns about the shortage of ICT specialists<sup>1</sup>. Even in Member States that are digital frontrunners, there is a persistent shortage of people able to develop and deploy key digital technologies<sup>2</sup>. There also is a significant increase in the demand for professionals combining sectoral knowledge with digital skills enabling the use of digital solutions for specific business cases. This is for example the case of employees in the manufacturing sector able to use augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) tools to repair engines remotely, software developers and engineers with specific automotive expertise, or professionals in industrial sectors that are key to the green transition who are increasingly relying on advanced digital technologies in the development of renewable energy or clean and smart mobility solutions. These profiles can be referred to as users of advanced digital technologies and they are crucial to enable and support the digitalisation of traditional industrial sectors from agriculture and finance to manufacturing, automotive and medicine, and are key to achieve the twin green and digital transition.</p><p>Looking at the related education offer, the 2022 JRC report shows that the offer of specialised education programme in AI, cybersecurity, HPC and data science has slightly improved in the EU 27, in particular in AI, where the number of Master programmes has increased by 20% compared to the previous year. However, it remains lower than in the United States. For cybersecurity the United Kingdom alone continue to offer as many programmes as all EU Member States together<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The actions in the skills pillar therefore aim at tackling this challenge, while triggering a new way of delivering these programmes, building partnerships between academia, businesses and research across the EU.</p><p><sup>1 </sup><em>SWD (2023) 205 final: COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT accompanying the documents: Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the key enabling factors for successful digital education and training and Proposal for a Council Recommendation on improving the provision of digital skills in education and training {COM(2023) 205 final}</em></p><p><sup>2 </sup><em>For example, over 70% of enterprises looking for ICT specialists in the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg found it extremely difficult to recruit ICT specialists.

The call of 2023 built on the experience of the first work programme<sup>5</sup>, addressing the latest initiatives to support the development and deployment of key digital skills and capacities in digital technology areas, such as AI, data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, as well as other inter-, trans- or multi-disciplinary areas, and their applications in strategic sectors. The call of 2024 will support the development and deployment of key digital skills in selected digital areas: virtual worlds, edge computing, quantum computing, photonics, and robotics and automatization. The call will also support interdisciplinary programmes that will target the acquisition of advanced green digital skills (e.g. in the area of AI, data analytics, virtual/augmented reality, robotics, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, etc.) in selected strategic sectors: agriculture, transport, renewable energy, waste management, as well as the acquisition of advanced digital skills for government and public sector. In the selected digital areas and strategic sectors there is a high demand for ICT specialists (and is expected to further grow), but at the same time the offer of education programmes for these areas/sectors is limited, what will hinder their potential for economic uptake and growth. The call should also support possible cooperation in the context of ongoing international cooperation related to digital topics (e.g. digital partnerships, trade and technology councils, policy dialogues, Talent Growth Task Force), e.g. by supporting students from those countries with financial support (e.g. via scholarships, fee waivers, or others) to participate in the education programmes including promoting female students participation. The proposals should clearly identify one digital area or one strategic sector as the main focus of their work and the challenges addressed. It is expected to fund at least the highest-ranking proposal from each above listed digital area or strategic sector providing that all thresholds are attain and within the limits of the budget available for this topic.</p><p>Projects financed under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and complementarities with actions on technology deployment supported by other pillars of the programme as well as links and synergies with programmes and initiatives like Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances, Erasmus+ Alliances for Innovation, European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), the EIT Campus, the Deep Tech Talent Initiative and its possible follow-up initiatives, as well as the Large Scale Partnerships under the Pact for Skills.</p><p>The primary objective of this topic is to support the design and deliver a higher degree education programme(s) (at ISCED levels 6 (Bachelor's or equivalent level), 7 (Master's or equivalent level) or equivalent in 2023 and at ISCED levels 6, 7, 8 (doctoral or equivalent level) in 2024 - hereafter education programmes and to develop related self-standing modules, in selected key digital areas and for the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific strategic sectors.

The funding should foremost facilitate the adoption and widespread use of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions. This should equip organisations with the latest and most effective tools and strategies available for cybersecurity, fortifying their overall cybersecurity capabilities, and helping them to become more resilient and better prepared to face the evolving challenges posed by cyber threats in the digital age. Such support should be in synergy with other actions undertaken by NCCs, such as their role as contact point, promotion of participation in cross-border projects and actions, establishing synergies with other activities, and fostering links with the ECCC and other relevant national and European actions such as the Digital Innovation Hubs. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. Indicatively 50% of the grant will be distributed via financial support to third parties. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role, they play with regards activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of, and in particular in those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>",,,,,
