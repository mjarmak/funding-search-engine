HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-FCT-04,Humanitarian demining of civil areas and explosive ordnance risk education,2025-06-12T00:00:03,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:  Improved, modern and validated tools, skills, methodologies and innovative training curricula for practitioners involved in humanitarian demining of civil areas, taking into account all applicable legislation and fundamental rights;  Improved education activities aimed at reducing risks of injuries from anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance;  Enhanced understanding of the key challenges and best practices related to humanitarian demining and to explosive ordnance risk education;  Evidence-based support to policy-makers on shaping of the EU mine action.  Scope: In post-conflict areas, lives of civilians are in danger and the return of economic activity is hindered because the land is contaminated by anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance. The EU provides a continuous support to humanitarian demining activities in heavily mine-affected countries and regions all over the world, thus promoting peace, security, post-conflict reconstruction, as well as social and economic rehabilitation. In Ukraine, mine action is a critical aspect of the humanitarian emergency response, the goal of which is to support the return of the civilian population and the rebuilding of crucial civilian infrastructure. As part of their mine action operations, EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, such as Croatia, Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Armenia also strive to make their land completely free of anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance. Humanitarian demining is not to be confused with military demining, which is the process undertaken by soldiers to clear a safe path so they can advance during conflict.  Various humanitarian demining initiatives have been developed, which often incur high costs and are typically slow because no mistakes are allowed. In addition, due to a large diversity of contaminated areas, types of anti-personnel mines and of their deployment methods, as well as a more complex contamination that includes improvised explosive devices, there is no single solution to the problem. Finally, new anti-personnel mines are being developed and new mine deployment techniques being used. Therefore, new, improved, innovative or disruptive solutions, accompanied by related training curricula, are needed to enhance humanitarian demining activities in civil areas. Since the aim of humanitarian demining is to restore peace and security, it has to be complemented by an adequate risk education, raising awareness of civilians of the risks from anti-personnel mines and other explosive ordnance, which will help them act in such a way that will reduce the risk to people and the environment. A range of risk education initiatives exist, but they usually lack, among others, collaboration with related Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), sustainability, and a comprehensive needs assessment aiming to improve their effectiveness. Within this topic, new, innovative, sustainable approaches are expected, which are adapted to regional and cross-border contexts. Proposals should also explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU and international level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Proposals are also expected to connect and create synergies and explore complementarities with other related initiatives in humanitarian demining and in explosive ordnance risk education. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological (humanitarian demining) and societal (explosive ordnance risk education) dimensions in a balanced way. To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes.  Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular Ukrainian national mine action authorities, researchers and innovators, demining agencies or companies as well as NGOs. Destination - Effective management of EU external borders Proposals for topics under this Destination should contribute to the following expected impact: “facilitating legitimate movement of passengers and goods into the EU, while preventing illicit acts” of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2025-2027. This destination will support the implementation of the European Commission political guidelines 2024-2029 for a ‘Safer and more secure Europe’, a ‘Preparedness Union’, with ‘Stronger Common Borders’, protecting democracy and putting research and innovation at the heart of a resilient economy. Overall, research under this Cluster should continue to focus on preserving and securing citizens’ basic right to feel safe. This destination will support the European Commission efforts towards: a wider EU Port Strategy focusing on security and a new European action plan against drug trafficking. boosting security research for stronger common borders / more secure and more fluid borders.  Projects funded under the topics of Work Programme 2025 will promote technological and social research and innovation and further explore and develop future capabilities for European practitioners in the areas of border management, customs and supply chain security, and civilian maritime and aviation security. Capability areas to address may include: monitoring, preparedness and reaction in border management tasks, managing irregular or illegal activities involving people or goods across external borders of the EU; safeguarding human rights, and ensuring legal compliance, in efficient border management; integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness (including but not limiting to maritime situational awareness) and analysis support; safety, user experience and performance of practitioners’ staff in border management; security, privacy and usability of identity and (travel) documents; facilitating travel of bona fide passengers across external borders of the EU; data analysis on documents, biometrics, or cargo compliant with GDPR and EU Artificial Intelligence Act and compatible with sandboxes approaches; detection of dangerous, illicit and illegal goods and materials trafficked through external borders of the EU and the supply chain; prevention and disruption of such trafficking.  Research and innovation funded under this Destination will contribute to policy objectives such as: the border management and security dimensions of the Pact on Migration and Asylum; the Multiannual Strategic Policy for European Integrated Border Management; the Capability Roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard; the proposals to strengthen EU legislation to prevent and fight against migrant smuggling; the proposals on digitalisation of travel documents and facilitation of travel; the civil security aspects of the updated EU Maritime Security Strategy; the proposals for EU Customs reform.  Research and innovation will contribute to sustain and improve capabilities to cope with potential future critical situations or emerging challenges regarding both the flow of people and the flow of goods across external EU borders. Examples may include: threats of illicit flows of dangerous materials and weapons because of conflicts outside the Union; the potential for large-scale movements of people including those resulting from the instrumentalisation of irregular migration, from conflicts, or from social, economic, environmental and climate stress in the EU neighbourhood; the exploitation and smuggling of migrants across the EU’s external borders, in particular of vulnerable groups including women and girls.  Furthermore, challenges can be exacerbated by the rapid adoption of new technologies by criminal organisations, and how new technologies help the sophistication of organised crime methods. Among technological approaches, for example, artificial intelligence (AI) offers many opportunities to improve border management services, including analytical support. At the same time AI also brings challenges such as morphing; potential misuse of data; doubts of bias or unexplained decision supports. Research and innovation are also necessary to minimise risks from these challenges, also in light of the full entry into force of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. Furthermore, research and innovation under this Destination will contribute to: lower the environmental impact and footprint of border, customs and supply chain security tasks, through innovative solutions and methods; integrate and improve safety and cybersecurity of EU information systems, of innovative equipment, and of information and data in these areas, especially during their exchange at operational or tactical levels; safeguard the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.  Research projects funded under this Destination should engage with all stakeholders involved, including travellers, migrants, and operators, as relevant. Research will integrate approaches to safeguarding and promoting EU values and fundamental rights in these areas, with a special focus on human rights. Projects should align and contribute to the realisation of the Capability Roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard (EBCG) published by the EBCG Agency (Frontex), especially the Roadmap’s mid- and long-term perspectives. The Roadmap provides strategic vision for investments into the development of capabilities and is the result of integrated planning between the Member States and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Proposals submitted under this Destination should explain the alignment with the Capability Roadmap and the plans for further uptake of the research outcomes, especially by involved practitioners in line with their national Capability Development Plans. Frontex will be closely associated with and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics. Hence proposals should consider and foresee that Frontex and/or eu-LISA may for example observe projects’ pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community. Furthermore, funded projects will likely have the opportunity of exploiting the core capabilities of the “Frontex Technology and Innovation Centre”, Frontex’s future collaborative space for testing, demonstration, simulation and assessment of solutions, processes and procedures. To accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined regarding the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users in the research projects’ Consortia. Proposals submitted under this Destination should demonstrate how they plan to build on relevant predecessor projects; to consider the citizens’ and societal perspectives; to include education, training and awareness raising for practitioners and citizens; to measure the achieved TRL. Regarding synergies and complementarities, this Destination will develop knowledge and technologies that may be taken up by other instruments, such as the Integrated Border Management Fund, in its components of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) and Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI). Member States authorities participating in research projects can plan to use those instruments for uptake (piloting, testing, validation, scale-up, transfer, acquire, deploy, etc) of innovative solutions developed from research, as early as TRL 7. Cluster 3 will further incentivise the use of European Space Programmes’ services for border management innovation where relevant and their services and capabilities, including demonstration and validation of new technologies in operational environments. Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EU-led or EU-funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation funded under Horizon Europe Cluster 3, or other security research and innovation working groups set-up by the Commission or EU Agencies. Funded projects are encouraged to liaise with the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), for example with regards to a possibility of testing the relevant research outputs at the JRC Border Security Lab. Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with projects in the same area should be considered, in coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation (CERIS)).

Destination - Resilient Infrastructure As stated in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2025-2027, proposals submitted under this Destination should aim to contribute to “[…] resilience of large-scale interconnected systems’ infrastructures and the bodies that operate them in case of complex attacks, pandemics, natural and human-made disasters, or the impacts of climate change[…]”. This destination will support the implementation of the European Commission political guidelines 2024-2029 for a ‘Safer and more secure Europe’ and ‘Preparedness Union’, while protecting democracy and putting research and innovation at the heart of a resilient economy. Overall, research under this Cluster should continue to focus on preserving and securing citizens’ basic right to feel safe. This destination will support the European Commission efforts towards: improving cyber capabilities, coordinating national cyber efforts and securing our critical infrastructures. the development of a new European Critical Communication System. building climate resilience and preparedness of infrastructure in sectors like energy, water or food, and informing the new European Water Resilience Strategy.  To this end, these proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts: address both physical and digital aspects of critical infrastructure security, including specific challenges for cybersecurity, and support development of upgraded systems, and the interoperability of existing systems, for operators’ resilience and the protection of critical infrastructure to enable a rapid, effective, safe and secure response and recovery, as also situational awareness and information sharing, without significant human involvement, to complex threats and challenges while also supporting emergency responders where their intervention is needed; security by design is a default feature of both newly created and upgraded infrastructures; improve cross-sectoral cooperation, as well as risk assessments to ensure the resilience and open strategic autonomy of European infrastructures.  More specifically, having in mind the fast pace of technological developments, growing dependencies of modern democratic societies, public administration and economies from critical infrastructure, as well as ongoing hybrid threats, and the impacts of climate change, diverse swiftly advancing challenges that European society faces merit dedicated research and innovation actions in the scope of this Destination. Some of these specific challenges are: mapping of critical infrastructure interdependencies leading to early threat identification and warning systems, mitigation plans and recovery procedures; supply chains of critical infrastructure; risk of unmanned platforms attacks on critical infrastructure; effective perimeter protection (e.g.: physical barriers, surveillance systems, access control, or cybersecurity measures) and monitoring including large area spanning infrastructure elements; new threats and hazards arising from climate change and/or the green transition, including widespread use of renewable energy sources; implementation of post-disaster recovery lessons to manage future exposure and vulnerability; lack of standards and advanced tools to conduct virtual and physical stress tests (sectoral and cross sectoral).  This destination will continue to support the policy objectives of the directives on the resilience of critical entities (CER Directive and on network and information security (NIS2 Directive. Further, submitted proposals should consider policy developments and meet some of the expectations stemming from the following EU legislation and policy documents, whichever would be relevant to the challenges addressed by the proposal:   Security Union Strategy; EU Counter-Terrorism Agenda; EU Cybersecurity Strategy; NIS2 Directive;; CER Directive; EU Adaptation Strategy; EU Maritime Security Strategy; EU Aviation Security Strategy; Europe-wide Climate Risk assessment (EUCRA) and Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks; Joint Framework on Countering Hybrid Threats and the Joint Communication on Increasing Resilience and Bolstering Capabilities to Address Hybrid Threats; EU C-UAS Strategy; or EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence; EU Disaster Resilience Goals.  Plans to build on elements of relevant predecessor projects should be considered, where relevant. It will be important also to take into account how research results can be advanced to deployable solutions after the projects lifetime, utilising validation and capacity-building programmes like the Internal Security Fund, or Digital Europe Programme. Where possible and meaningful, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful actions in the same, or other relevant areas. should be considered, including the organisation of international events in coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS)).

HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-02,Open topic for role of the human factor for the resilience of critical infrastructures,2025-06-12T00:00:08,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Critical infrastructure is more resilient to natural hazards, intentional and accidental harmful human actions, including cyber attacks; Infrastructure operators and authorities have better understanding of human factor for the critical entities resilience; Infrastructure operators and authorities have access to improved risk and threat assessment, and forecast; Infrastructure operators and authorities have access to increased post-incident investigation capabilities contributing to better crisis prevention; Insider threats are effectively tackled, including through innovative, cost-efficient systems for background checks that are in full compliance with privacy; Training curricula for infrastructure operators, authorities and/or first responders are developed.   Scope: Under this open topic, proposals are invited to address new challenges, and/or develop innovative solutions or strengthen capabilities to tackle existing challenges taking into account the human factor, for the benefit of resilience of critical infrastructures. The emphasis of the proposals should be on the human dependant abilities of critical infrastructure to cope with an adverse event, including their capacity to prepare for the crisis, absorb the impact, reduce the recovery time, and adapt by reducing future exposure and vulnerabilities.  ToTo ensure the active involvement of, and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. Activities proposed within this topic should address both technological and societal dimensions of the tackled challenge in a balanced way. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-01,Generative AI for Cybersecurity applications,2025-06-12T00:00:09,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects will develop technologies, tools, processes that reinforce cybersecurity using AI technological components, in particular Generative AI, in line with relevant EU policy, legal and ethical requirements. Proposals shall address at least one of the following expected outcomes:   Developing, training and testing of Generative AI models for monitoring, detection, response and self-healing capabilities in digital processes, and systems against cyberattacks, including adversarial AI attacks. Development of Generative AI tools and technologies for continuous monitoring, compliance and automated remediation. These should consider legal aspects of EU and national regulation as well as ethical and privacy aspects.  Scope: The use of Artificial intelligence is becoming indispensable with applications where massive data is involved. Understanding all implications for cybersecurity requires deeper analysis and further research and innovation. Generative AI presents both opportunities and challenges in the field of cybersecurity. This topic supports the research on new opportunities brought by Generative AI for Cybersecurity applications, to develop, train and test AI models to scale up detection of threats and vulnerabilities, enhance response time, cope with the large quantities of data involved, and automate process and decision-making support; for example by generating reports from threat intelligence data, suggesting and writing detection rules, threat hunts, and queries for the Security information and event management (SIEM), creating management, audit and compliance reports and reverse engineering malware. Proposals addressing expected outcome a) (i) Advanced threat and anomaly detection and analysis: Current cybersecurity tools may struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of cyber attackers. Developing, training and testing of Generative AI models can be used to analyse large volumes of data and accurately identify anomalies and deviations from normal patterns of behaviour, enabling more effective threat detection, analysis and response. Tools should also support cybersecurity professionals as they may struggle to detect and respond to threats posed by generative AI, particularly as these systems become more sophisticated and difficult to distinguish from genuine human activity. (ii) Adaptive security measures: Cybersecurity tools often rely on static rules and signatures to detect threats, making them less effective against new and evolving attack methods. In addition, many cybersecurity tools still rely on manual intervention for threat response, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. Generative AI, through development, training, finetuning and testing of Generative AI models can support these tools to adapt and respond to emerging threats in real-time, improving overall security posture. (iii) Enhanced authentication and access control: The use of AI technologies could improve resilience of authentication and access control systems to unauthorized access and credential theft, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or systems. Proposals addressing expected outcome b) (i) Development of tools powered by Generative AI that analyse and facilitate the Application of the national and EU regulation in digital systems, in particular the Artificial Intelligence Act, the Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2) and the Cyber Resilience Act.  (ii) Adaptation to a dynamic environment. Companies, public sector and organisations face an ever-changing environment which makes keeping up with compliance towards cybersecurity rules challenging. On one hand there’s a variety of rules applicable at sectorial, national or European level to be considered. On the other, change management and updates in ICT systems in organisations is frequent. Addressing both facets with tools powered with Generative AI brings the potential for a compliance continuum within organisations otherwise limited in time when driven by human intervention only. All proposals will have to respect Trustworthy and Responsible AI principles and data privacy. All proposals shall demonstrate the EU added value by fostering the development of EU technology, the use of open-source technologies when technically and economically feasible, the exploitation of available EU data (Data Spaces, EOSC, federated data etc) Proposals must define key performance indicators (KPI), with baseline targets to measure progress andand to demonstrate how the proposed work will bring significant advancement to the state-of-the-art. All technologies and tools developed should be appropriately documented, to support take-up and replicability. Participation of SMEs is encouraged. Proposals will pay special attention to the Intellectual Property dimension of the results. The usability of the outcomes and results once the project is finished will be closely assessed.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-02,New advanced tools and processes for Operational Cybersecurity,2025-06-12T00:00:10,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: The use of and dependence on information and communication technologies have become fundamental aspects in all sectors of the economy. Public administrations, companies and citizens are more interconnected and interdependent across sectors and borders than ever before. This higher uptake of digital technologies increases exposure to cyber security incidents, vulnerabilities and their potential impacts. At the same time, Member States are facing growing cybersecurity risks and an overall complex threat landscape, with a clear risk of rapid spill-over of cyber incidents from one Member State to others. Moreover, cyber operations are increasingly integrated in hybrid and warfare strategies, with significant effects on the target. In particular, the current geopolitical context is being accompanied by a strategy of hostile cyber operations, which is a game changer for the perception and assessment of the EU’s collective cybersecurity crisis management preparedness and a call for urgent action. The threat of a possible large-scale incident causing significant disruption and damage to critical infrastructure and data spaces demands heightened preparedness at all levels of the EU’s cybersecurity ecosystem. In recent years, the number of cyberattacks has increased dramatically, including supply chain attacks aiming at cyberespionage, ransomware, or disruption. The vulnerability landscape is also threatening. The ENISA Threat Landscape Report 2024 counts a total of 19,754 vulnerabilities. This amount of vulnerabilities can’t be manually managed by humans. There is a need for automated management of vulnerabilities based on established standards like the Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). As regards detection of cyber threats and incidents, there is an urgent need to increase the exchange of information and improve our collective capabilitiescapabilities in order to reduce drastically the time needed to detect cyber threats and mitigate, before they can cause large-scale damage and costs. While many cybersecurity threats and incidents have a potential cross-border dimension, due to the interconnection of digital infrastructures, the sharing of relevant information among Member States remains limited. Proposals are expected to address this emerging threat landscape with the development of advanced frameworks, services tools, and processes, in line with relevant EU legislation (NIS2, Cyber Resilience Act, Cyber Solidarity Act). Lastly, focus should be given to developingdeveloping innovative frameworks, technologies, tools, processes, and services that reinforce cybersecurity capabilities for operational and technical cybersecurity cooperation, in line with relevant EU policy, with particular focus on NIS2, Cyber Solidarity Act and the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, as well as legal and ethical requirements. Proposals shall address at least two of the following expected outcomes: Enhanced Situational Awareness through advanced Cyber Threat Intelligence frameworks, tools, and services as well as cybersecurity risk assessments of critical supply chains made in the EU, Frameworks, tools, and services for preparedness against Cyber and Hybrid Threats in information and communication technology (ICT) and operational technology (OT), including cybersecurity exercises, Expanded Security Operations Centre/Computer Security Incident Response Teams (SOC/CSIRT) functionality through advanced tools and services for detectiondetection, analysis, incident handling including response and reporting as well as remediation, Development of testing and experimentation facilities for advanced tools and processes for operational cybersecurity, including the creation of digital twins for critical infrastructures and essential and important entities as defined in NIS2, Development and pilot implementation of cross-sector and/or cross-border cyber crisis management frameworks, services, and tools,  Frameworks, services, and tools aimedaimed at mechanisms and processes for enhanced operational cooperation between public sector entities (CSIRT network, EU-CyCLONe). Extension of the above to essential and important entities as defined in NIS2 would be an advantage. Scope: Proposals are expected to demonstrate the developed frameworks, tools, services, and processes through pilot implementations involvinginvolving the participation of relevant national cybersecurity authorities and/or essential and important entities as defined in NIS2, implemented with the participation of leading European cybersecurity industry. Proposals shall consider the impact of forthcoming legislation, in particular the Cyber Resilience Act. Real world applications and the usability of the solutions developed should feature predominately in the proposals. The participation of the following types of entities is highly encouraged: innovative European cybersecurity start-ups and SMEs with a proven track-record in cybersecurity innovation at EU level (e.g. active participation in successful EU funded projects including cybersecurity projects under Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme cybersecurity projects or EIC Pathfinder or Accelerator projects), European start-ups and SMEs that can demonstrate established operational cooperation with relevant National Cybersecurity Authorities, European start-ups and SMEs that have received equity investments by national, European or private Venture Capital funds for cybersecurity activities etc. The participation of these start-ups and SMEs with an active role in the implementation of the proposed action (project coordination, technical coordination, lead of pilot implementation etc) would be considered an asset.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-03,Privacy Enhancing Technologies,2025-06-12T00:00:11,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Development of robust, scalable, and reliable technologies to uphold privacy within federated and secure data sharing frameworks, as well as in the processing of personal and industrial data, integrated into real-world systems. Development of privacy preserving approaches for data sharing solutions, including privacy-preserving cyber threat information sharing, and in collaborative computations involving sensitive data. Integration of privacy-by-design at the core of software and protocol development processes, with attention to ensure that cryptographic building blocks and implementations of privacy-enhancing digital signatures and user-authentication schemes are crypto-agile and modular, to facilitate a transition towards post-quantum cryptographic algorithms. Development of privacy enhancing technologies for the users of constrained devices.  Contribution towards the advancement of GDPR-compliant European data spaces for digital services and research, such as those on health data, aligning with DATA Topics of Horizon Europe Cluster 4. Development of privacy enhancing technologies and solutions, to benefit the requirements of citizens and companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Development of blockchain-based and decentralized privacy-enhancing technologies, to preserve data confidentiality, integrity, and the authenticity of transactions and digital assets. Possible combination of blockchain with other technologies, such as federated learning, will need to address the data's security and privacy shared through such networks while ensuring that theirtheir connected devices are trusted. Investigating the usability and user experience of privacy-enhancing technologies and exploring ways to design systems that are both secure and user-friendly.   Scope: Protecting individuals' personal data and ensuring privacy while allowing for data processing and analysis is fundamental for our society. Privacy-preserving techniques allow to minimize the amount of personal data collected and processed, and to protect that data through advanced cryptographic methods. For instance, machine-learning methodologies are leveraged to dissect medical and behavioural data, aiming to unearth causations and insights into cyber attacks or threats. However, a substantial portion of this data comprises personal information, (such as sensitive health data), raising concerns over potential breaches or misuse, thus jeopardizing the privacy of individuals, societal well-being, and economic stability. In addition, the challenges related to the exploitation of non-personal/industrial data assets, which could impede the full realization of the data-driven economy, are also subject to the work that can be proposed under this topic. Solutions that can provide security against quantum adversaries are also encouraged. Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as cryptographic anonymous credentials, differential privacy, secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, advanced digital signatures, such as ring signatures, blind signatures and attribute-based credentials hold promise in mitigating these challenges, yet their practical application necessitates further refinement and rigorous testing. Consortia are encouraged to propose solutions that can improve the usability and effectiveness of different PETs in realistic environment and to investigate their integration within common European data spaces. The inclusion of agile schemes designed in a modular way to support the transition to post-quantum PETs and the design, improvement and security analysis of quantum-resistant PETs is welcome, in light of the advances of quantum technologies. Proposals should also focus on enhancing the usability, scalability, and dependability of secure and PETs within supply chains, while seamlessly integrating with existing infrastructures and conventional security protocols. They should also accommodate the diversity in data types and models across various organizations, undergoing validation and pilot runs within authentic data environments. Adherence to data regulations, notably GDPR, is paramount. Consortia should seek to intertwine interdisciplinary expertise and resources from industry stakeholders, service providers, and end-users. The engagement of SMEs is encouraged, alongside the inclusion of legal proficiency to ensure regulatory compliance, including GDPR adherence. Furthermore, proactive identification and assessment of potential regulatory hurdles and constraints for the developed technologies/solutions are strongly encouraged.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-04,SecuritySecurity evaluations of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) primitivesprimitives,2025-06-12T00:00:12,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:  breakthroughs in understanding the quantum hardness of various mathematical problem classes that underpin the security of current and future post-quantum cryptosystems; new quantum algorithms with significant quantum speed-up for lattice-based, code-based, and potentially other mathematical problem-classes; AI-based approaches to help discovering vulnerabilities of lattice-based or other mathematical problem-classes; cryptanalysis results; parameter suggestions to create a robust set of cryptographic building blocks for post-quantum cybersecurity and design of post-quantum cryptosystems with improved security against quantum or AI-based attacks.   Scope: The intrinsic security of PQC algorithms is based on mathematical problems that are believed to be intractable for both classical and quantum computers. To assess the quantum security of post-quantum primitives is fundamental in order to boost our confidence on post-quantum cryptosystems. The development of quantum algorithms demonstrating a significant quantum speed-up would represent a major breakthrough, necessitating a reassessment of the security of cryptosystems (lattice-based, code-based, and others). Conversely, if no significant quantum speed-up is discovered, it would bolster our confidence in the security of these post-quantum cryptosystems, though some parameters may still require fine-tuning. Studies are also needed on AI-based approaches that may be used to attack certain schemes with certain implementation choices, and the discovery of eventual vulnerabilities can help the research community develop more robust post-quantum cryptosystems. Proposals on the assessment of the security of post-quantum primitives, via studies focused on eventual quantum algorithms with demonstrable speed-up, eventually also in combination with AI, or on solely AI-based approaches, are welcome. The security of lattice and code-based PQC algorithms may be prioritized, but tackling other mathematical problem classes is not excluded. As the unprecedented computational power of quantum computing can greatly enhance AI capabilities, combination of different approaches may also be considered. Consortia with team of applicants with background in post-quantum cryptography and in quantum computing are particularly encouraged. Project should lead to identification of vulnerabilities of current post-quantum cryptographic building blocks and to practical recommendations for parameters for the design of post-quantum cryptosystems with improved security against quantum attacks and future advances in code-breaking and AI.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-05,Security of implementations of Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms,2025-06-12T00:00:13,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Design and implementations of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms that are resistant to side-channel and fault attacks; Optimized countermeasures taking into account a balanced trade-off between security, performance, and costs; Recommendations on implementing countermeasures for a broad range of attacks, also identifying the available and necessary hardware; Analysis of new attacks or combinations of attacks, also eventually enhanced by AI, applicable to real-world conditions. Design of automated security evaluations for PQC implementations.  Scope: The security of the implementations of PQC algorithms is vital for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability of digital information and communications in the face of implementation attacks, such as, for example, side-channel attacks using information from timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, fault attacks disturbing the secure of operation of the device and their combination. Such attacks, eventually also enhanced by the use of deep learning, constitute significant threats to both (embedded and regular) software and hardware implementations. In various application areas such as IoT, cloud-based applications, automotive, measures to prevent such attacks currently lead to substantial resource overhead due to the complexity of the algorithms, and the security remains unclear given the limited exploration of different attack surfaces. Countermeasures, to the extent that they are available, may have significant impact on run-time and memory consumption. Resistance in PQC implementations to implementation attacks is an increasingly common concern among customers, especially when exploring the right balance between security and performance. Evaluating the security of PQC algorithm implementations against side-channel and fault attacks is crucial, given the proven vulnerabilities. Various countermeasures, such as masking, shuffling, randomized clocking, random delay insertion, constant weight encoding, code polymorphism, control-flow integrity and re-computation of critical operations can be employed to mitigate these attacks. Synergies between specific countermeasures and the design of cryptographic systems are available for pre-quantum cryptography but require investigation for post-quantum cryptography. Proposals are welcome on developing solutions that protect against such implementation attacks, at reasonable costs and minimizing the loss of performance while maintaining the required security, as well as on the analysis of new attacks or combinations of attacks, also powered by the use of AI, for security-by-design approaches when designing Post Quantum Cryptographic systems. Activities can also lead to the development of testing methodologies and frameworks for automated security evaluations for correctness and resistance to remote side-channel attacks for regular software and for correctness and resistance to a broad range of implementation attacks for embedded software and hardware.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-02-CS-06,Integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms into high-level protocols,2025-06-12T00:00:14,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Proposals are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Design and implementations of at least one high-level post-quantum cryptography protocol along with a security analysis demonstrating that no security is lost compared to the used building blocks/lower-level protocols (KEMs, signatures, AEAD,…); Submission of these high-level protocols integrating PQC to standardization bodies and/or submission of the specification and implementation to the respective open source projects; Requirements analysis highlighting roadblocks and needs for development of PQC solutions for missing building blocks for migrating high-level protocols to PQC.  Scope: The transition to post-quantum cryptography requires changing the uses of most currently deployed public-key cryptography (RSA and ECC). Research and development efforts are providing signature systems and key-exchange mechanisms that are generally accepted to withstand attacks using classical and quantum computers. Efforts are on the way to include these in core Internet protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). While this is an important development, many more protocols need to be modified to be quantum-ready and to ensure backward compatibility with legacy systems. Various application areas, such as Internet of Things, cloud-based applications, and automotive, place constraints on bandwidth or processing time which may prompt different choices than those employed for TLS. Currently used high-level protocols may have components that are specific to Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) or to Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) or may require additional building blocks next to or in place of signatures and key-exchange mechanisms. While applications that provide authenticity are less urgent to migrate than those for confidentiality, those using embedded hardware such as secure elements, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using hardware tokens and others have a very slow turnover and need to be replaced by the time large quantum computers exist, thus requiring migrating the design in the near future. Activities should target one or multiple relevant high-level protocols and produce their post-quantum versions. Typically, this can be achieved through combining current and post-quantum solutions for backward compatibility. Atypical solutions with equivalent security are also welcome. Consortia composed by actors of different nature, such as, for example, research institutions, relevant public entities, and industry to ensure that PQC solutions meet real-world security demands and are robustly tested across various applications are also welcome. Destination - Disaster-Resilient Society for Europe Given the increasing frequency and ever greater impacts of disasters resulting from climate extremes, natural, geohazards and human-made hazards, the EU needs to invest more in improving disaster risk management, tools for first responders and societal resilience. In this respect, along the orientations given in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2025-2027, the main objectives of this destination supporting the reduction of losses from natural, accidental and human-made disasters will be pursued in continuity with the strategic plan 2021-2024. This destination will support the implementation of the European Commission political guidelines 2024-2029 for a ‘Safer and more secure Europe’, a ‘Preparedness Union’, with ‘Stronger Common Borders’, protecting democracy and putting research and innovation at the heart of a resilient economy. Overall, research under this Cluster should continue to focus on preserving and securing citizens’ basic right to feel safe. This destination will support the European Commission efforts towards: enhancing efforts to prevent and prepare for new threats, especially those linked to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) security. continuing to address risks to security from climate change impact / step up work on climate resilience and preparedness. supporting medical countermeasures against public health threats.  Moreover, thisthis destination will support the implementation of UN Disaster Risk Reduction policies, the EU Disaster Resilience Goals involving closer coordination with the Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network, the rescEU initiative and Member States’ civil protection authorities, as well as an enhanced dialogue at international level with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) on recommendations for the Sendai Framework and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Such closer coordination with other programmes will make it possible to further streamline future research programming. For example, Cluster 3 should focus on its core added value, which is a strong operational character for preparedness, response and learning, while maintaining complementarities with broader prevention issues such as climate-related risks, covered by Cluster 5, and the Mission on Climate Change Adaptation. There are similar examples in closer coordination with Cluster 6 and the One Health approach, regarding, for instance, water and food security threats (as a result of intentional degradation or terrorist acts). From a technological perspective, the Destination will ensure greater involvement of practitioners in close cooperation with the Member States and EU agencies, not only in research development and implementation, but also the identification of gaps and needs and future research topics. Actions to develop tools and technologies to meet operational capability needs should be aimed at higher technological readiness levels (TRLs). Finally, it will be important to take into account how research results, both those still to come and those already developed in past projects under the DRS destination, can be turned into deployable solutions by being combined with capacity-building programmes (in particular the Internal Security Fund, funding under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism the European Regional Development Fund, and the Cohesion Fund) and social innovation to support the entry into the market of developed technologies. Actions will also aim to ensure that there is a link between R&I and possible procurement (e.g., in the area of medical countermeasures). Proposals for topics under this Destination should have the overarching objective of improving resilience. Actions will continue to explore initiatives and experiments involving the development of technological or methodological solutions for crisis management and support for emergency responders, getting the general public more involved in this area and improving interactions between regional and/or local authorities, public practitioners, private operators and civil society. Actions could also take into consideration regions vulnerable to extreme weather events in coastal areas, sea level rise and other climate change impacts, which may prone to disaster risks (e.g. the Arctic). New tools or solutions should build on what has been developed in past projects and be capable of being integrated into existing (legacy) systems. Actions will also focus on multi-service capability developments, in particular tools and technologies to support direct operational needs in case of a disaster. This will be done in a scalable way, covering areas from small rural towns to economically developed ones with a high population density, and opening research initiatives to international cooperation. Capabilities need to be upgraded to match the new resilience stakes and expectations of practitioners and of society as a whole. We should learn from past disaster events by identifying gaps in capabilities that the response to such events showed were lacking. For example, one of such gaps are the availability of medical countermeasures used to effectively respond to deliberate or accidental releases of CBRN substances. The destination will continue to follow a multi-hazard approach, addressing disasters and threats of all kinds, including their cascading issues, climate-related or natural and geological hazards, industrial accidents, pandemics, intentional hostile acts including terrorism and armed conflict. Particular attention will be paid to floods and wildfires, as well as to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRN-E) threats. To this end, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts: Enhanced citizen and regional and/or local authorities' involvement in research actions, and in operational measures that may result from research, with focus on risk awareness and enhanced disaster prevention and preparedness, including youth awareness raising and education; Improved disaster risk governance (from prevention, preparedness to mitigation, response, deployment of countermeasures and recovery, using updated risk assessment methods and decision criteria, and including knowledge transfer and awareness of innovative solutions) from international to regional and/or local levels; Strengthened capacities of first responders in all operational phases related to any kind of (natural and human-made, including hybrid threats) disasters in support of field operations with validation of tools and technologies used in disaster responses including emergencies, and demonstration of their interoperability.  More precisely, in the context of exacerbated impacts of various disaster threats on vulnerable societies, research and innovation actions are highly needed to face the many challenges faced by European Society. Some of them are: Challenges related to inclusion of the general public, regional and/or local communities and voluntary organisations as active partners in order to:        empower citizens to act and help them to improve their disaster risk awareness and own resilience to crises, including accountability for regional and/or local administrative decisions on residual risks, youth awareness raising and education;    provide means for regional and/or local decision-makers and operational responders, i.e., first and second responders, infrastructure owners, regional and/or local authorities (including public services, transport and utilities) to coordinate prevention and preparedness actions, bearing in mind the socio-economic and cultural context, and for operational responders to influence regional and/or local planning decisions that affect exposures and vulnerability to risks in short and long term;    address citizens’ perception of, and involvement in, civil defence in the event of very large-scale disasters including armed conflict.   Challenges regarding the reinforcement of disaster risk governance and the consideration of knowledge and innovative solutions in order to:        improve operational management of crises at different levels (prevention, preparedness, response, recovery) and scales (international to regional and/or local),    reinforce the uptake and transfer of knowledge to risk managers, first and second responders and decision-makers;    Strengthen resilience and enhancing protection strategies for emergency services and healthcare workers in case of disasters;    Reinforce civil defence capability, looking at all facets of crisis and disaster management, alongside community resilience building;    Enhance preparedness for optimised detection, prevention, response and control measures in case of bioterrorism or emerging diseases.   Challenges related to the validation and usability of tools and technologies, including the demonstration of their interoperability, in the context of strengthened first responder’s capacities as to:         enhance risk awareness, preparedness and communication about foreseeable impacts of disasters;    deploy innovative solutions in emergency situations including trusted communication channels, medical care, medical countermeasures, support equipment (e.g. detectors), triage of victims as well as protection of first responders;    enhance validation of tools, technologies and processes for cross-border prevention, decision-support and responses to climate-related and geological disasters and emergency crises by different practitioner sectors (firefighters, medical emergency services, civil protection, police, NGOs);    enhance interoperability of tools and technologies used in international emergency (real-case) situations related to natural hazards, CBRN-E threats and hybrid threats via inputs such as standard operating procedures for foresight, risk analysis or guidance with the aim to improve market uptake.   This Destination will also support, whenever appropriate and applicable, the proposals with some or all of the following goals: a clear strategy from international to regional and/or local on how the overall society will adapt to the evolving disaster risks based on the subsidiarity principle (from the citizen level to international decision-making); the involvement of different responders (firefighters, civil protection, medical emergency, police) and regional and/or local authorities in research, development and validation of methods and tools; the active role for Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs); the active involvement of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); a robust plan on how they will build on the relevant predecessor projects, and clustering with existing research (EU and national) actions to maximise complementarities and synergies and avoid duplication of efforts; education and training aspects for first and second responders for different types of threats (climate-related, geohazards, accidental, intentional), as well as information sharing and awareness raising of the citizens; a clear strategy on the uptake of the outcomes, defined in consultation with the involved stakeholders; a well-developed plan both on how research data for training and testing will be obtained, in order to reach the requested Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs), and on how the specific TRL will be measured.  Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events. Proposals are invited against the following topic(s):",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-DRS-01,"Open topic on citizen and regional and/or local authorities' engagement in enhanced disaster risk awareness, including education, and preparedness",2025-06-12T00:00:15,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to one or both of the following expected outcomes: Improved disaster preparedness, learning from past disasters or crises, and better sharing of knowledge on lessons learned and risk awareness to citizens and regional and/or local authorities, understanding what countermeasures were taken in previous incidents and exploring currently available products to improve future outcomes; Reinforced dialogue and cooperation among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policy-makers and regional and/or local communities in disaster risk reduction for an enhanced uptake of research outputs.   Scope: Societal resilience and preparedness to disasters are shaped by the way authorities and citizens exchange, access, understand, and react to information about hazards. As a result, anyone may become more vulnerable if barriers to these processes occur. Strengthening societal resilience to disasters, therefore, requires investment by authorities at operational, strategic, and policy levels to improve engagement with citizens and integrate inclusive communication processes. In order to achieve this, it is important to take into account the diversity of citizens, be it relating to age, gender, educational levels, disability, and other social characteristics. The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The EU’s disaster resilience goal No. 2 is “Prepare – Increasing risk awareness and preparedness of the population.The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting these two policies and coordinate with the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Proposals are invited to utilise the Special Eurobarometer on “Disaster risk awareness and preparedness of the EU population” as evidence of needs. Under the Open Topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions and technology, including the use of AI, for improving disaster preparedness, risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities, and for reinforcing the cooperation among scientific / technical communities and policy-makers / regional and/or local authorities for an enhanced sharing of knowledge and uptake of research outputs. If they relate to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022 or 2023-2024, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Proposals are expected to address one of the following options: Option a: Tools and solutions to improve disaster preparedness and risk awareness by citizens and regional and/or local authorities; Option b: Mechanism to enhance dialogue among research/academic communities, practitioners and regional and/or local authorities for sharing knowledge and effectively uptake research results. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-DRS-02,Open topic on Improving disaster risk management and governance to ensure self-sufficiency and sustainability of operations in support of enhanced resilience,2025-06-12T00:00:16,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome(s): Better understanding of the impact of disasters and crises, and improved early warnings and long-term planning linked to natural causes or to human-made threats (including CBRN) on risk governance, including emergency services, regional and/or local authorities, and citizen volunteers, and improved adaptation and resilience of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness – especially in a multi-risk environment with cascading disasters.   Scope: Improved risk governance, adaptation and resilience requires authorities and communities to adopt risk and resilience management approaches, which are inclusive (including regarding gender, age, disabilities, etc.) and innovative, through pre-defined plans and procedures, as well as through adaptable and flexible capabilities to prepare for, respond to, recover from and learn from disasters and crises. It requires the implementation of policies at different levels (international to regional and/or local) and strategies for a better understanding of impacts and enhanced risk preparedness and adaptation, which are co-developed and enabled through all-of-society engagement and participation, and hence strengthen resilience to disasters among authorities, decision-makers, private actors, intermediary actors, volunteers and citizens, and the most vulnerable. The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and coordinate with the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the Open Topic, proposals are welcome to address new, upcoming or unforeseen challenges and/or creative or disruptive solutions for an enhanced understanding of impacts of disasters and crises linked to natural or human-made causes on risk governance and improved resilience of emergency systems, that are not covered by topics of Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2023-2024. If they related to some of the topics covered by Horizon Europe Calls Disaster-Resilient Society 2021-2022, the proposals should convincingly explain how they will build on and not duplicate them. Proposals are expected to address one of the following options: Option a: Enhanced impact forecasting and early warning systems, understanding of climate / weather extreme events and geohazards and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention and preparedness; Option b: Enhanced impact forecasting and understanding of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, Explosive (CBRN-E) threats and adaptation of emergency systems for disaster prevention preparedness and response (including medical countermeasures). Projects need not address all elements of CBRN-E. Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed projects, proposals should also convincingly explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed tools and solutions. Furthermore, proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes’ projects. Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage beyond the project consortium with volunteers' organisations, regional and/or local authorities and disaster management authorities during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the Disaster Risk Reduction community.  To ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant practitioners, i.e., emergency responders (with expertise in the different types of natural or human-made threats), proposals should plan a mid-term deliverable consisting in the assessment, performed by the practitioners involved in the project, of the project’s mid-term outcomes. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of related research and innovation activities.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-DRS-03,"Open topic on Testing / validating tools, technologies and data used in cross-border prevention, preparedness and responses to climate extreme and geological events and chemical, biological or radiological emergency threats",2025-06-12T00:00:17,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcome(s): Enhanced European and global interoperability of existing tools and technologies and improved capacities to prevent, better prepare and respond to different types of disasters (natural and human-made) by various practitioners (e.g., firefighters, medical responders, civil protection).   Scope: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) tools is increasingly at the core of first responder’s decision-making processes, including situational awareness, analysis and planning. Besides the needs to develop AI and ML tools, ground technologies such as miniaturised sensors that can operate autonomously for a long period in harsh environments and are fast and easy to deploy are needed for threat detection (such as chemical, biological or radiological substances) and/or identification of victims and possible locations for intervention. In addition, responders need to exchange information (language, data, video, etc.) in a reliable, secure, and universal way, while emergency communications throughout the European Union also need to be strengthened. In many instances, interoperability of tools, technologies and communication channels is still an open issue, requiring standard operating procedures, specific education, training and exercises of responders. The European Commission is developing and implementing an EU Preparedness Union Strategy following whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches. The proposals’ outcomes should especially work towards supporting the Strategy and coordinate with the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) to ensure a successful uptake to the end users. Under the Open Topic, proposals are welcome to testing / validate tools, technologies and data used in cross-border prevention, preparedness and responses to climate / geological / accidental fire disasters and chemical, biological or radiological emergency threats (including medical countermeasures) by different practitioner’s sectors in view of demonstrating their interoperability in real-case situations, with focus on the use of AI and ML tools, miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification, and communication (including cross-border emergency communications). Proposals are expected to address one of the following options focused on testing / validation of tools and technologies, and demonstration of their interoperability: Option a: Use of artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) tools to support first responder’s analysis, planning and decision-making; Option b: Miniaturized sensors for threat detection and victim identification; Option c: Information exchange / Communication among first responders in a reliable, secure and universal way, and cross-border emergency communications; Option d: Alert system to detect CBRNCBRN threats, integrating different systems at national, regional and European levels.

Each consortium will define the selection process of the third parties for which financial support will be granted. From 5% up to 20% of the EU funding requested by the proposal may be allocated to the purpose of financial support to third parties. The proposals should outline the methods and processes by which they intend to decide which organisations they provide support to, respecting principles such as transparency, equal treatment, non-discrimination between organisations and effectiveness (impact).

HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-DRS-04,"Advancing Autonomous Systems and Robotics for High-Risk Disaster Response, strengthening disaster resilience in conflict-Driven Crisis Zones",2025-06-12T00:00:18,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Multi-Function Autonomous Systems for High-Risk Scenarios, to develop and adapt robotic systems to navigate the unique challenges posed by conflict-driven disasters, such as unstable structures and heavily obstructed urban environments. These systems will perform or support civilian tasks like search and rescue, hazard assessment, and supply transport in areas too dangerous for human responders; Enhanced remote sensing and situational awareness, creating sensor-based technologies that improve situational awareness for first responders and decision-makers, enabling them to assess disaster zones remotely and safely; Autonomous navigation and search capabilities in dangerous environments focusing on technologies that enhance the ability of autonomous systems to perform search operations in low-visibility or smoky conditions, typical of areas impacted by bombings, fires, or other conflict-related incidents; User-centred and real-world testing conducting extensive pilot testing of autonomous systems and robotic solutions in environments that replicate the conditions of conflict zones and urban disasters; Capacity building and training for autonomous system deployment providing specialised training guidelines for first responders and civil protection agencies to operate and maintain autonomous systems effectively in conflict scenarios.  Scope: Conflicts such as the Russian war against Ukraine and the overall geopolitical context marked by tensions and conflicts make it more pressing than ever to ensure that are equipped with advanced tools that not only enhance their capabilities, but also protect their lives and increase operational efficiency in extreme environments. These crises demand a new level of preparedness and resilience, where autonomous systems, robotics, and cutting-edge technologies work in unison to support swift, coordinated, and safe responses. In light of the ongoing conflicts and the complex, high-risk environments they present, this topic focuses on developing and deploying advanced autonomous systems specifically tailored for large-scale, multi-dimensional disasters and tailored to the challenges of conflict driven. These disasters, exacerbated by geopolitical conflict, severe infrastructure damage, and immediate safety threats to both civilians and responders, demand innovative and resilient solutions. The topic seeks to address the EU’s critical need for tools that protect infrastructure, services, and populations while enhancing resilience and operational readiness. Through rigorous real-world testing and capacity-building programs, responders will be trained to integrate and manage these autonomous systems effectively, preparing them for rapid deployment in high-stakes scenarios. The project will focus on delivering innovative, durable, and efficient technological solutions that allow the EU and its partners to respond effectively to crises similar in complexity and danger in environments similar as the one of the war in Ukraine. By developing tools that address the unique operational and safety challenges posed by such scenarios, this topic will reinforce the EU’s preparedness to protect both citizens and first responders, ensuring swift, coordinated responses to complex crises across Europe and beyond. Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances. Destination - Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Since the Preparatory Action for Security Research the EU-funded security research and innovation programme has contributed substantially to knowledge and value creation in the field of internal security. The programme has been fundamental to the consolidation of a European security ecosystem, which is better equipped to capitalise on research and innovation outcomes to support the EU security priorities. This Destination aims to contribute to reducing thematic fragmentation, bringing closer together the actors from different security domains, and expanding the market beyond traditional thematic silos. It also creates knowledge and value through research in matters (including technology, but also social sciences and humanities) that are not exclusive of only one security area, but cross-cutting to the whole Cluster. As underlined in the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2025-2027, proposals for the topics under this Destination ‘should support with cross-cutting actions the expected impacts outlined above [in the Cluster 3 Destinations]. The destination will increase the impact of the work carried out in the EU security Research and Innovation (R&I) ecosystem and contribute to its core values, namely:  a focus on the potential and practical final use of the outcomes of security R&I;  forward-looking planning of EU security capabilities;  the development of security technologies that are socially acceptable, developed in quadruple helix and that have added value for industrialisation, joint procurement, commercialisation, and the acquisition and deployment of successful R&I outcomes;  safeguarding the EU’s open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU civil security technology and industrial base;  experimenting with research and innovation programming; and  helping to make the European R&I ecosystem more consistent’.  Many of the programme outcomes have materialised in relevant scientific findings, maturation of promising technology areas, operational validation of innovative concepts or support to policy implementation. However, a key challenge remains in improving innovation uptake and thus contributing to the development of security capabilities, support of Start-ups and Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and deployment of innovation by security practitioners. The extent to which innovative technologies developed thanks to EU R&I investment are industrialised and commercialised by EU industry, and acquired and deployed by end-users, could reflect the impact achieved with the programme. As explained in the Commission staff working document on Enhancing security through research and innovation there are factors inherent to the EU security ecosystem (often attributed to the market) that hinder the full achievement of this impact, such as market fragmentation, cultural barriers, analytical weaknesses, programming weaknesses, ethical, legal and societal considerations or lack of synergies between funding instruments, among others. To that aim, there is a need to create a favourable environment that is designed with the main purpose of increasing the impact of security R&I, which provides the right tools that serve to tackle the factors that hinder innovation uptake. Therefore, security research and innovation shall foster and enhance the development of innovative tools, technologies and capabilities for the benefit of practitioners that can use in their day-to-day work. To this end proposals under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following impacts: A more effective and efficient evidence and knowledge-based development of EU civil security capabilities built on a stronger, more systematic and analysis-intensive security research and innovation cycle; Increased cooperation between demand and supply market actors, including with actors from other domains, fosters swift industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of successful outcomes of security research and reinforces the competitiveness and resilience of EU security technology and industrial base and safeguards the security of supply of EU-products in critical security areas; R&I-enabled knowledge and value in cross-cutting matters reduces sector specific bias and breaks thematic silos that impede the proliferation of common security solutions.  The Destination will trigger actions that will help bringing these and other developments closer to the market, thus contributing to the measures facilitating the uptake of innovation. Those actions will help developers (including industry, research organisations and academia) to accelerate product development and improve the valorisation of their research investment. They will also support buyers and users in materialising the uptake of innovation and further develop their security capabilities. The aim is to increase the capacity of EU public procurers to align their requirements with the EU security industrial capacity and to attract innovation and innovators from security and other sectors through common validation strategies, rapid innovation, experimentation and pre-commercial procurement. Finally, the Destination will contribute to the development of the tailored analytical capacity required for the adoption of capability-driven approaches aimed at fostering a forward-looking capability-driven approach in security. Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events. Proposals are invited against the following topic(s):",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-SSRI-01,"National Contact Points (NCPs) in the field of security and cybersecurity fostering the links with National Community building for Safe, Secure and Resilient Societies",2025-06-12T00:00:19,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Improved and professionalised NCP service of knowledge, experience and skills, consistent across Europe, thereby helping simplify access to Horizon Europe calls, lowering the entry barriers for newcomers, and raising the average quality of proposals submitted; Harmonised and improved trans-national cooperation between NCPs, and support of National communities for research and innovation in the area of security that can collect input from practitioners, industrial partners and convey capability needs.; Increased cooperation of NCPs with seamless collaboration of the national initiatives, with the EU initiatives, namely CERIS; Periodic and timely evidence-based feedback in support to EU-funded security research programming enabled by a seamless integration of the national, regional and local dimensions of security Research and Innovation into the EU picture; A systematic assessment of the needs of the various stakeholders involved in the areas of security and increase the visibility of capability needs, gaps, and technology solutions expressed by national, regional and local communities; Improvement of the awareness of EU funding opportunities relevant for civil security research and innovation; Improvement of the awareness of innovation-uptake success stories stemming from the participation of national players in EU-funded security research projects; Reduced geographical fragmentation of the civil security research and innovation community via the cooperation with the various initiatives of National Communities of security research and innovation with the participation of stakeholders from the security ecosystem, that are set up and running in the different Member States or Associated Countries  Scope: National Contact Points (NCPs) are support structures that have become an essential component in the implementation of successive Framework Programmes. They provide information and on-the ground advice to potential applicants and beneficiaries, through the project life cycle, in their own language, in a manner that would be impossible for the European Commission and its Agencies acting alone.  NCPs can benefit in their work from the sharing of best practices among them. NCPs can also help to give visibility to different perspectives of all Security Research and Innovation (R&I) stakeholders and to break geographical silos by aggregating the knowledge existing in the EU Member States and regions and incorporate it to the European picture. This set-up increases the visibility of the security at EU level and across security areas.  However, the security sector exhibits a remarkable geographic fragmentation, with actors operating at EU level, at national level, at regional level and even at local level. In order to acknowledge the different perspectives of all stakeholders and break geographical silos, there is a need to aggregate the knowledge existing in the Member States and Associated countries and incorporate it to the European picture.  Cooperation with national stakeholders and establishment of stronger links with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS). These links shall help to have a more comprehensive view of the common EU security needs and solutions, to better capitalise on pan-European cooperation and funding opportunities, and to give visibility to results from EU and other research projects. Proposals shall link NCPs with national communities for research and innovation that exist already or will be established. The idea of this link is to identify capability gaps, solutions to address those gaps, and research needs at local, regional and national level and integrate them in the EU picture in collaboration with CERIS. In addition, this collaboration will assist NCPs to share research opportunities coming from national research programmes and initiatives with the wider security research community at national level. This will also improve the visibility of the results achieved by national players following their participation in research projects (national or EU-funded), and in particular those which have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or which have a strong potential for uptake as a result of the interest expressed by national buyers. Finally, this will support the promotion of innovation uptake with financial pathways and opportunities to enable the uptake of innovative solutions stemming from EU, national or regional capacity building funds, with special emphasis on the EU Home Affairs funds (both in the parts under shared management and those under direct management by the Commission) and on the European Regional Development Funds. As an output of the action, the beneficiaries shall develop a model for the cooperation and enlargement of with the national research and innovation communities beyond the lifetime of the project and independent of EU security research funding. The objective is to support the establishment of self-standing national communities beyond the duration of the project. The successful proposal will contribute to delivering the Programme’s objectives and impacts and raise awareness of potential applicants for calls under Horizon Europe Cluster 3 – ""Civil Security for Society"". Irrespectively of their sector or discipline, project proposals should aim to facilitate trans-national co-operation between NCPs, with a view to identifying and sharing good practices and raising the general standard of support to Programme applicants. The project should also allow for a better flow of information relevant for the implementation of the Programme from the EU level to the national level and vice-versa, and also across Member States and Associated Countries. This includes fostering the participation of national players in EU security research and innovation fora. Particular attention should be given to results that have led to the deployment of solutions in the field of operations, or that show a strong potential for uptake because of the interest expressed by national buyers. Proposals should link up potential participants from widening countries with emerging consortia in the domain of the Cluster “Civil Security for Society” building on previous initiatives from similar past projects. Matchmaking should take place by means of online tools, brokerage events, info days and bilateral meetings between project initiators and candidate participants from widening countries. Other matchmaking instruments may be used as appropriate. The project proposal to be funded should cover a wide range of activities related to Horizon Europe, address issues specific to the Cluster ""Civil Security for Society"" and may follow up on the work of SEREN5. The network shall organise matchmaking activities in accordance with Annex IV of the NCP Minimum Standards and Guiding Principles. Proposals should also take into account support activities for coordination between the respective beneficiary (NCP) and the respective National Coordination Centre within the relevant Member States as applicable once the regulation mentioned above is in force. The project consortium should have a good representation of experienced and less experienced NCPs. The recommended duration of the project is 3 years.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-SSRI-02,Uptake Acceleration Services,2025-06-12T00:00:20,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: To offer advanced services on innovation uptake to the security community; To provide a self-sustained mechanism for advanced advisory and support services, to act as a market catalyst; and to accelerate the uptake of innovation for security; Enhanced cooperation between research institutions, smaller private research agencies, security practitioners, Start-ups and SMEs to support innovation uptake; Strengthening the technology transfer from research to the market and strengthening of security ecosystem. Supporting Start-ups and SME to reach the security market and strengthen the capacity of security practitioners to uptake innovative tools from the security market.   Scope: The uptake of innovation stemming from EU-funded security research is not a single-step process, and there is no single method of ensuring the market uptake of successful research results. Innovation uptake needs to be contemplated as a long process that is conditioned by a number of enabling actions to be taken before research is even planned and long after it is completed. However, market uptake and deployment of innovation by security practitioners are recurrent challenges in civil security research. The EU-funded security research ecosystem has changed the traditional relationship between practitioners and solution providers. The awareness of security needs and solutions has been steadily growing at all levels during the last years, with EU funded security research and innovation projects playing a pivotal role. This awareness guarantees not only that research addresses critical needs, but also that the research investment will deliver tangible results. There are several approaches to achieve a better market uptake and to ensure that innovation can pass from the realm of research to the realm of the market and eventually innovative tools to be used by security practitioners. In order to support SMEs and start-ups but also practitioners to find the avenues of uptake of innovation, models and methods for transferring research to the market should be promoted. This topic aims to offer services and guidance to entities in the security ecosystem to achieve market uptake. The services should be delivered to SMEs/Start-ups and Practitioners. Therefore, there would be Supply-oriented Services and Demand-oriented services. Some of the expected services could be open for the whole community (e.g., material online) and examples of good practices, whereas others would be provided upon specific request by an entity (on demand services). On demand services may be linked to other EU-funded actions but should not cover activities already funded from those in order to avoid double funding. Applicants should be able to demonstrate a proven experience in technology development and innovation in the area of security and deep knowledge on the security ecosystem. Successful candidates should be able to provide services such as: Funding & procurement guidance Market research / competitive landscaping / Marketplaces / Market surveys/consultations Proof of concept development (for TRL 2-4) Funding and tendering observatory Investor search / venture building Technology validation support Lab testing support (i.e., Readiness assessment, Artificial Intelligence act compliance, Machine Learning security, Ethical Legal and Societal assessment, High Performance Computing capabilities, Synthetic data generation, Access to Datasets, stress testing etc.) Tech and/or entrepreneurial skills development (training)   The proposals should outline the methods and processes by which they intend to decide which organisations they provide support to, respecting principles such as transparency, equal treatment, non-discrimination between organisations and effectiveness (impact). The project should provide suggestions for such methods and processes as deliverable to be approved by the European Commission. The applicants submitting the proposals have to ensure sufficient representativeness of the communities of interest (including, but not only, geographical representativeness) and a balanced coverage in terms of knowledge and skills of the different knowledge domains required to face the challenge, including security operations, technologies, research & innovation, industry, market, etc. The applying consortia need to demonstrate that the project beneficiaries guarantee the expertise required to steer the project activities in all the knowledge domains to ensure the success of the action. The work of the partners has to be supported by solid and recognised tools and methods, also accompanied by the required expertise to put them in practice. Proposals should take into account the work initiated by the Networks of Practitioners funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes and the ongoing work of Knowledge Networks. Proposals should build to the extent possible on the outcomes of previous initiatives that foster innovation uptake (e.g., iProcureNet Multirate, etc). In addition, existing initiatives like Horizon Booster EACTDA and EAFIP have some components which could be used by the successful project and to be adapted in the area of security. The project has to identify and describe options for the sustainability of the services beyond the project lifetime, including the setting up of a permanent scheme which will continue to offer the proposed services to the community as a self-sustainable mechanism. In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 5 years. The provision of financial support to third parties in the form of grants is optional.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-SSRI-03,Open grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies,2025-06-12T00:00:21,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:  Consolidated demand for innovative security technologies built on the aggregation of public buyers with a common need expressed in functional and/or operational terms without prescribing technical solutions;  Better informed decision-making related to investment in innovative security technologies based on a better understanding of the potential EU-based supply of technical alternatives that could address common needs of EU public buyers;  Better informed decision-making related to investment in innovative security technologies based on an improved visibility of the potential demand in the EU market for common security technologies;  Increased capacity of EU public procurers to align requirements with industry and future products and to attract innovation and innovators from security and other sectors through common validation strategies, rapid innovation, experimentation and pre-commercial procurement;  Increased innovation capacity of EU public procurers through the availability of innovative tendering guidance, commonly agreed validation strategies and evidence-based prospects of further joint procurement of common security solutions.   Scope: End-users and public procurers from several countries are invited to submit proposals for a preparatory action that should build the grounds for a future Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) action. Both this preparatory action and the future PCP action are open to proposals oriented to the acquisition of Research and Development (R&D) services for the development of innovative technologies, systems, tools or techniques to enhance border security, to fight against crime and terrorism, to protect infrastructure and public spaces, and/or to make societies more resilient against natural or human-made disasters.  In preparing the grounds for a possible future PCP action, the outputs of this Coordination and Support Action (CSA) should take into consideration: The policy priorities described in this Work Programme Part for the security areas mentioned above;  The EU Directive for public procurement and in particular with the provisions related to PCP;  The specific provisions and funding rates of PCP actions and the specific requirements for innovation procurement (PCP/PPI) supported by Horizon Europe grants, as stated in the General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme;  The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2021) 4320, in particular those measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start-ups and innovative SMEs.   During the course of the project, the applicants are expected to deliver clear evidence on a number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk a possible follow-up PCP action, including:  That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives;  That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint procurement of innovative solutions;  That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project;  That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge;  That a future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&D services according to the PCP rules; That the technology developments to be conducted in the future PCP can be done in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data; That in developing technology solutions, societal and gender aspects (e.g., perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) can be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner.   If the applicants intend to submit a proposal for a follow-up PCP in a future Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, they should ensure that the above evidence is consolidated in the project deliverables of this CSA before the submission of the PCP proposal.  In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.  The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 1 year.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-SSRI-04,Accelerating uptake through open proposals for advanced SME innovation Specific conditions,2025-06-12T00:00:22,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Development of a mature technological solution addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme; Facilitated access to civil security market for small innovators; Improved cooperation between public buyers and small supply market actors for a swifter uptake of innovation in response to short to mid-term needs; Stronger partnerships between small and medium EU security industry and technology actors to ensure the sustainability of the EU innovation capacity in the civil security domain and reduce technological dependencies from non-EU suppliers in critical security areas.   Scope: Europe’s 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities. However, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security. Knowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users. Applicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles: Focus on mature technological solutions addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 Work Programme; Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries; Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations; Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security.   Examples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc. The participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production. It is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role. Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified. The projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.",,,,,,,,
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-SSRI-05,Data repository for security research and innovation,2025-06-12T00:00:23,,,,,,,"Expected Outcome: Projects’ results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes: Accurately gathered, stored, managed and preserved research training and testing data, disaggregated by gender if relevant, which is verified and selected in order to be realistic, up-to-date and sufficient, as well as to make research more trustworthy and reproducible; Researchers and projects can further increase the impact and visibility of their work by not just archiving research materials, but also opening them up for reuse and citation by other relevant actors and stakeholders; Properly shared and re-used relevant research data can save lives, help develop solutions and maximise the knowledge; Enhanced collaboration among relevant research community, improved trust between researchers and practitioners/end-users, facilitated co-operation between different research projects and reduced burden of wasted research or lost results.  Scope: The underlying idea of this topic is to avoid that security and disaster risk research projects obtain and prepare data that at the end of the projects is simply lost instead of being stored and shared for reuse. In the security domain, due to its specificities, the special categories of data involved or/and unique limitations, which may call for additional requirements, a consolidated, common research database is particularly desired. It is of utmost importance that security practitioners are provided with an increased interoperability and improved (cross-border) exchange of data thanks to harmonised data file formats across Europe, which would easily take into account technological evolutions, i.e., be adaptable in time. Such a lack of realistic, up-to-date and sufficient training and testing data for research purposes and consequently the need for a database, data repository or any other effective and useful tool(s) to gather, manage and store varying security research data, have been regularly raised by the projects working in the area of security. The same is true of data on disaster risk management where national or regional analysis and forecasting databases or national disaster risk assessments can be fragmented or sealed without reasonable open, sustainable access to the wider community.",,,,,,,,
