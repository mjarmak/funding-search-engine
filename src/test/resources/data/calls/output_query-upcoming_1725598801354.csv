To this end, it is important to enhance its sustainability while creating wealth and additional employment opportunities in Europe.</p><p>Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>Reduce the environmental footprint associated to PV technology deployment across all the phases of the system lifetime (production, transport, installation and end of life). </li><li>Define design and processing guidelines to optimally address circularity of PV systems for one or several PV technologies (silicon, thin film, organic PV, perovskite PV, etc.). </li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>In order to identify the main areas of improvement for the environmental footprint and resource efficiency of PV, it is necessary to regard the technology's entire lifecycle. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), important knowledge can be gained as to which processes and materials contribute most to the overall environmental footprint. The lifecycle-thinking also aids in identifying key candidates to reduce the use of resources from the design phase. Although it seems self-explanatory that reduction/substitution or efficient use of critical materials lead to improved environmental impact, it is of course essential that these do not adversely affect the function of the technology.</p><p>For a renewable energy technology to be successful, it needs to have a strong net positive energy balance. This implies that the energy payback time of systems needs to be short, the carbon footprint needs to be reduced, the use of local materials to reduce transport costs in systems needs to be increased, the use of hazardous materials needs to be avoided, and systems and system components need to be designed in a way that encourages recycling and decreases material usage.</p><p>Modern eco-friendly technologies and long lasting, repairable products are required in combination with sound circular economy approaches to process the huge stock of valuable resources at the end of life.</p><p>International cooperation with the Mediterranean Region is encouraged.</p>",,"<p>This Destination includes activities targeting a sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply. In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).</p><p>The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral, in current and future climate conditions. R&amp;I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&amp;I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&amp;I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO<sub>2</sub> emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&amp;I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.</p><p>This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.</p><p>This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's <strong>Key Strategic Orientations (KSO)</strong>:</p><ul><li><em>C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;</em></li><li><em>A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy</em>[[<sup></sup><em>'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.</em>]]<em> by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;</em></li></ul><p>It covers the following <strong>impact areas</strong>:</p><ul><li>Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;</li><li>Affordable and clean energy.</li></ul><p>The <strong>expected impact</strong>, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to <em>'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions?</em>, notably through</p><ol> <li>Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable <strong>renewable energy technologies</strong> and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).</li><li>Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply.

They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.</p><p>It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[<sup></sup>Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.</p><p>In line with the 'do not significantly harm? principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.</p><p>Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.</p><p>All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential, and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.</p><p>Regarding the REPowerEU communication, renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels.

Renewable fuels can be used in transport but also in buildings and industry to meet the demand for electricity and heat, therefore displacing fossil fuels. Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication, as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels, and in particular advanced biofuels, contribute to reduce the EU's dependence, because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels, utilizing the existing infrastructure.

The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.</p><p>As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a <strong>Mission Label</strong> 'to the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC?. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.</p><p>A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#documents"">Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)</a></p><p>]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: <strong>the Main Commitment Part</strong> which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; <strong>the Climate Neutral Action Plan</strong> which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the <strong>Climate</strong><strong>Neutrality Investment Plan</strong> which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.</p><p>The Mission Platform will undertake a <strong>completeness check</strong> where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the <strong>co-creation process</strong> in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the <strong>Climate Neutrality Action Plan</strong> and the <strong>Climate Neutrality Investment Plan</strong>.</p><p>After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.</p><p>The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the <strong>consultation of the Mission Board</strong> and <strong>recommendation from the Mission Owners Group,</strong> the Mission Manager will decide whether to <strong>endorse</strong> the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.</p><p><strong>Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work Programme</strong></p><p>Climate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making.

They are the interface between rural and urban environments and are often the subject of high pressure from the urban core which results in an un-controlled and uneven urban expansion towards the rural territory often triggering environmental degradation. While dispersed and heterogenous in terms of land-occupancy, density and services and amenities distribution, the peri-urban territory integrates mutual inter-dependences within the urban-rural continuum. These can be associated with people (inwards and outwards migration or socio-demographic change) as well as with linkages and flows between a variety of rural and urban related functions and activities (ranging from industrial and recycling manufacturing, agriculture production and food processing, sanitation, waste disposal, drinking water provisions, to housing - including slums and gated communities - transport and associated infrastructure, large-scale commercial sites, and large recreational areas such as parks or forests), which juxtapose, collide and mesh in unintended and unplanned ways.</p><p>Peri-urban areas are also the subject of weaker governance structures and limited institutional capacity, which in return limits the capacity to regulate economic activities and land-use and land coverage and makes it difficult to implement effective and integrated local, regional, and functional urban area wide policies and programs. This is particularly challenging in areas that straddle multiple jurisdictions, such as urban-rural fringe.</p><p>This topic aims to foster the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within the current peri-urban development and planning practice to reduce these areas GHG emissions and to improve their liveability.</p><p>Proposals, depending on chosen domains, should investigate a sustainable and decarbonised development of the peri-urban areas by shifting from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources in mobility, energy or industry domains supported by adequate governance structures and practices based on a sustainable land-use planning and an urban expansion which integrates environmental considerations and determinants. In addition, proposals should provide European demonstration-type examples on how to sustainably integrate climate-neutral, green, and smart solutions and measures into the peri-urban/urban development and the existing transport, energy, and industrial infrastructures, to achieve long-term decarbonization impacts and necessary climate resilience. Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project. Positive, long-term impacts on social cohesion, economic development, and public perception - resulting in behavioural change and policy change - should be fostered and anticipated. Proposals, depending on selected domains should:</p><ul><li>Explore particular characteristics of peri-urban areas that are distinct from rural and urban ones and analyse relevant urban-rural dynamics such as continuous and frequent land-use and functional changes, poor and inaccessible transport infrastructure, scattered and unevenly distributed day-to-day services and amenities.</li><li>Explore models of urban/peri-urban development and planning containing the above-mentioned dynamics (e.g., expansion model, densification model, green-belts and green-corridors model) aimed at overcoming the sustainability, decarbonisation and local climate (e.g. heat islands) challenges of the urban-rural fringe while ensuring co-creation with and engagement of the relevant stakeholders (including citizens and communities).</li><li>Focus on domains that are particularly pertinent in achieving progress in sustainable development, such as: <ul><li>Mobility and transport with extensive use of personal cars with combustion engines, poor and scattered infrastructure, and lack of sustainable transport options. Transport related emissions that are exacerbated by intensive commuter flows generated by peri-urban areas. City focused solutions that are not adapted to peri-urban areas and challenges often exceeding organizational, financial and knowledge capacities of local authorities. Proposals should analyse and explore how peri-urban generated traffic impacts the transport flows (for both goods and people) and its contribution to the total CO2/emissions of the entire urbanized territory.</li><li>Industry, accounting for 30% of CO2 emissions and often located in peri-urban areas, is capital in succeeding the transition towards a net zero economy. Proposals should analyse the contribution to the total emissions reduction, of improved energy efficiency measures in industrial processes located in peri-urban areas, as well as of the deployment of strategic net-zero technologies, such as solar, (PV and thermal), wind, hydrogen, batteries and storage (incl. thermal energy storage), heat pumps and geothermal energy, electrolysers and fuel cells, biogas/biomethane, carbon capture and storage, and grid technologies, as envisaged in the EU Net Zero Industry Act. Proposals should ramp up and facilitate public-private partnerships, notably the key role of Local Green Deals (LGDs).</li><li>Circular economy: Peri-urban areas are key for setting up recycling facilities for materials, products and equipment and scaling up material reuse, such as Social Urban Mining and recycling infrastructure across different industries (e.g., online marketplaces to empower exchange for materials, or physical Materials Banks for construction and demolition materials). Proposals should explore, analyse and facilitate the deployment of innovative industrial recycling processes, industrial symbiosis and closed-loop systems, as well as supporting knowledge transfer through innovative practices; piloting local platforms for Social Urban Mining; demonstrating recycling and re-use processes for building and public works materials, industrial waste, water and waste management; enabling material reuse; inducing circular practices, reuse of materials and behavioural change.</li><li>Vulnerability of peri-urban areas to environmental damage as most of the urban wastes (solid and liquid) and pollutant activities are pushed in the peripheries.</li><li>Electricity grids and heating/cooling solutions are suboptimal in some peri-urban areas. The often-low energy efficiency and individual fossil fuel or even solid fuel-based heating of the building stock exacerbates energy poverty in the absence of sufficient population density for district heating while the lower real estate prices hamper deep renovation. The opportunities of available space for i.e., clean energy production or electricity and thermal storage are not sufficiently exploited to increase living comfort, accelerate energy transition for the benefit of the local economy and nearby urban areas.</li><li>Governance, as peri-urban areas can be beyond the legal authority of cities, nor are they considered as part of the rural administrative units. Therefore, the capacity to regulate economic activities (and thus land-use and land coverage) is weak. This results in the peri-urbanization being largely an unplanned process, informal and sometime illegal and often resulting in environmental hazards and degradation of natural resources. This also results in a scattered and uneven distribution of services, amenities, and resources across the peri-urban area. The weaker governance structures complicate also integrated planning and green procurement of energy, transport, and other services.</li><li>Social and cultural characteristics of peri-urban areas that are gaining on heterogeneity with continuous social dynamics. In many (Central and Eastern) EU cities the peri-urban expansion was driven by the emergence of a stronger middle class. However, in more recent years there has been an increasingly heterogenous mix of occupants/actors with multiple and most often conflicting interests, including settled populations, populations living in gated estates, in-migrants, transient workers, emerging middle-class among others. This overall leads to heterogeneous communities and, in general, to a lack of social cohesion.</li> </ul></li></ul><p>The research actions should cover the following:</p><ul><li>Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way, and provide a summary of measures contributing to climate neutrality in European peri-urban areas, identifying barriers.</li><li>Establish co-designing process and engaging with the relevant stakeholders (such as: citizens, local authorities, mobility operators, service providers, energy companies, private businesses?) to ensure a successful uptake of solutions contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.</li><li>Develop, test, and demonstrate scalable solutions in real life in at least two out of the four domains (Mobility, Energy, Industry, Governance) contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.</li></ul><p>Each proposal should involve stakeholders from at least three 'lead urban/peri-urban areas', and at least three 'replicator' urban/peri-urban areas. Each urban/peri-urban area should establish a living laboratory where, under real life-conditions, a set of complementary and reinforcing solutions, centred on two to four aspects from the ones presented above (mobility, energy, industry, and governance) should be developed, tested, and implemented in an integrated approach. The participating urban/peri-urban areas, which may have a geographical coverage that goes as far as the full functional urban area, should demonstrate their common interests, and outline how they will ensure a meaningful and close cooperation. The peri-urban areas should each be situated in different EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe. Each proposal should at least include one urban area of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities.</p><p>To allow for a thorough evaluation of the projects' outcomes, proposals are expected to provide measurable indicators to demonstrate how the tested solutions are contributing to the climate neutrality objectives of the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission and participating peri-urban areas. These should be supported by clear baselines, quantified targets, and appropriate review processes for each participating urban area.

In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p>After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.</p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission Label</strong></p><p><strong>Climate City Contracts (CCC)</strong> are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030?. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it - the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.</p><p>As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a <strong>Mission Label</strong> 'to the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC?. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.</p><p>A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#documents"">Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)</a></p><p>]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: <strong>the Main Commitment Part</strong> which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; <strong>the Climate Neutral Action Plan</strong> which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the <strong>Climate</strong><strong>Neutrality Investment Plan</strong> which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.</p><p>The Mission Platform will undertake a <strong>completeness check</strong> where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the <strong>co-creation process</strong> in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the <strong>Climate Neutrality Action Plan</strong> and the <strong>Climate Neutrality Investment Plan</strong>.</p><p>After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.</p><p>The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the <strong>consultation of the Mission Board</strong> and <strong>recommendation from the Mission Owners Group,</strong> the Mission Manager will decide whether to <strong>endorse</strong> the CCC and award the Mission Label.

From the reallocation of the urban public space to more sustainable forms of transport and energy generation and use, intermodal hubs, and interchanges to the dynamic management of the street profile and curb side, and the integration of suburban/peripheral areas in the general urban fabric and patterns, current and future research should aim to make urban public spaces more liveable while enabling better a connectivity, accessibility, social interaction, inclusion and transit in the context of a changing climate. Concepts like the '15-minute city? and 'superblocks? are gaining momentum and have an enormous potential in shaping the urban planning and design practice and the mobility services based on the principle of proximity. This is supporting the efficient and green mobility goals, the transport and energy policies, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the new EU Urban Mobility Framework.</p><p>Considering the optimisation of urban public spaces, aspects related to air quality and urban climate must be considered by designing strategies based on new technologies and green infrastructures/green city zones.</p><p>The proposal should address the question on how to deal with limited urban public space and conflicting demands for it between transport and other users, considering social and climate goals and the need to shift towards more energy efficient and sustainable modes of transport, decarbonisation of the heating and cooling infrastructures.</p><p>Each proposal should envisage pilot demonstrations in at least three cities (lead cities) situated each in a different Member State or Associated Country including both urban and sub-urban areas. Proposals should provide the necessary evidence of the cities' commitment to test and implement the co-designed solutions. To foster replicability and up-taking of the outcomes, each proposal should also engage at least three replication/follower cities with the development of local replication plans. The size and characteristics of the cities should be considered. Each proposal should include at least one city of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities for the lead cities and one for the replication/follower cities.</p><p>The pilots should involve a co-design process with the stakeholders concerned by the re-design of the urban space. The pilots should involve public and private local energy, mobility and industrial stakeholders as well as civil society to identify integrated, locally supported and space-saving solutions and related pre-conditions (incentives, participatory methods, etc.) in a change management process to gain public acceptance by information, participation and consideration of groups that were so far disadvantaged by existing conditions.</p><p>Demonstrations should be 'digital by default' and use Local Digital Twins and, where possible, Mobility Data Spaces as tools for optimizing traffic, improving mobility services, monitoring environmental benefits in air and noise, and modelling a better use of urban space.</p><p>Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project.</p><p>Proposals should address the following two areas of intervention:</p><p><strong>1. Reallocation of space and re-design of infrastructure</strong></p><p>This is a major game changer in cities in favour of more sustainable and efficient use of resources through integrated approaches that promote decarbonisation of different sectors notably sustainable modes of transport, buildings and industry and related services. By (re)designing and reallocating the urban public space to reflect the level of use of different transport modes, unsustainable transport, heating and cooling modes can be discouraged while sustainable ones incentivised. Smart urban public space design and management is also a key enabler for scaling-up new mobility services. First, it can help to develop more sustainable and accessible mobility services, with stations and hubs for shared devices and charging infrastructures, dedicated lanes for light and active modes, pick-up and drop-off zones, etc. Also, it can help to increase the acceptance of sustainable mobility services, by mitigating negative externalities caused by the inadequate use of urban space, such as illegal parking, and cluttering the sidewalks by e-scooters, advertising banners, traffic signals and others. The reallocation of space is also important to transform roads from mere transit spaces into public spaces with a higher socioeconomic value to people - a feature which has become extremely important for local recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The same applies to the planning and management of urban space to accommodate local clean and smart energy infrastructures to power the different uses of energy including mobility, buildings, commercial and industrial activities. One goal of the energy system integration would be to optimise the use of urban space and existing infrastructures to avoid unnecessary investments in distribution grids while increasing energy autonomy of the municipalities and reducing losses in transmission and distribution of energy. Moreover, planning and implementing simultaneously infrastructure projects can significantly reduce investment costs and space needs such as e.g. building an underground car park together with space for a geothermal heat pump or thermal heat storage.</p><p>Four of the following research actions should be addressed to overcome these challenges either in the mobility (points 1 to 4) or energy area (points 5 to 8):</p><ol> <li>Develop integrated transport and urban planning tools and methods to coordinate sustainable mobility services and the design of future public realms, accounting also for their interrelations and impacts across different spatial and temporal scales. This should be linked to the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) of the cities.</li><li>For electromobility, foster research results from pilot projects on reallocation of use of transport infrastructure - or use of the single infrastructure for diverse types of vehicles, amenities (such as bi-directional charging points), and vehicles (e.g. after hours sharing of publicly accessible transport fleets) throughout the community of stakeholders at EU level.</li><li>Research solutions for the exploitation of legacy infrastructure and how it can contribute to the scaling of sustainable mobility services followed by projects and demonstrations that can help to better understand this space shift, and play a significant role in the design, piloting and roll-out and assessment of these new mobility services.<s>;</s> Past experiences with street space reallocation (e.g. temporary infrastructures under COVID-19) can serve as a basis.</li><li>Involvement of current service providers and infrastructure managers (e.g. parking service providers) in the urban space ecosystem to understand how current players can contribute to new mobility services, increased multimodality, electrification and integrated city logistics and citizens' mobility.</li><li>With regards to energy, support pilot projects to increase understanding and exploitation of the potential of road space allocation and smart distributed energy generation and green city zones/infrastructures in a systemic manner and monitoring their positive effects on human well-being.</li><li>Research opportunities for exploiting current infrastructures (e.g. buildings, grids, underground spaces) complemented by additional elements (e.g. access to data in real time, demand response, storage, smart charging, heat and energy storage) to facilitate local energy communities, virtual power plants and energy sharing while minimising the need for new infrastructures requiring space and facilitating multipurpose construction projects. This should also include the integration of thermal and electricity grids and storage to better manage and balance renewable electricity generation and demand.</li><li>Establish an integrated approach for designing and decarbonising the heating and cooling networks (including distributed installations and small-scale networks and related storage) in cities and urban areas in synchronisation with planning of new housing, major renovations or industrial development related to major heat consuming or waste heat generating facilities.</li><li>Explore ways of using/optimising green and blue infrastructures to city and street scale for improving urban climate, reduce the energy demand and in view of emission free transport.</li></ol><p><strong>2.</strong><strong>Dynamic curb-side management and use</strong></p><p>Smart management of urban space and existing infrastructure includes their dynamic use, when considering curb space, changing its role and function in time, depending on parameters, functions and needs in relation to commuting peak hours, deliveries, public transport priority, market days, nightlife, etc. Dynamic space management is already being explored in some cities and represents an opportunity for further integration in mobility plans with the support of smart technologies, Intelligent Transport Systems, Local Digital Twins and Mobility Data Spaces, AI based autonomous optimal control and management systems.</p><p>As the rise of new shared mobility services such as ride hailing, micromobility and the growth in urban goods delivery (even more so with the recent exponential growth of e-commerce) are challenging traditional ways of managing curb space, novel approaches are needed. Research on a shift away from curb use focused on street parking to a more flexible and dynamic allocation that for example includes pick-up and drop-off zones for passengers and freight or dedicated public transport lanes during peak hours, has also shown the potential to enhance and prioritise sustainable mobility services, and thus decrease the pressure on traffic thanks to an increased percentage of shared rides.</p><p>To ensure the implementation of these innovative approaches, R&amp;I could support by developing:</p><ul><li>Tools and guidelines to ensure the implementation of innovative approaches of dynamic space and curb use, resulting from tests and pilots of flexible allocation of curb side functions, including pick-up and drop-off zones for passengers and freight.</li><li>New models of fee calculation (e.g. trip purpose, space demand (size) of each vehicle using the public domain, etc.) and financial model for the use of public space in cities in view of reaching public policy goals including climate neutrality.</li></ul><p>To increase impact and coherence, project(s) should maximise coordination with leading European associations and initiatives in this domain, e.g. Living-In.EU, the New European Bauhaus, Covenant of Mayors, the EIT KIC Culture and Creativity, the EIT Urban Mobility, the CIVITAS initiative, the 2Zero partnership and EU co-funded projects in the domain of Technologies for Smart Communities. Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential, and projects must ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work plan of the proposal. The collaboration with the Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date.</p>","<p>The Work Programme 2023-2024 of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in line with the provisions under the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/cities_mission_implementation_plan.pdf"">Implementation Plan</a> of the Cities Mission, fosters the implementation of the Mission through actions that will continue to provide a strong and direct support to cities that will commit to climate neutrality and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution.

Achieving urban mobility decarbonisation can involve a variety of policy and technology measures and solutions. However, technological innovations alone are not sufficient for achieving a decarbonised urban transport system. They should be complemented by measures tapping into changes that target travel patterns and generate a shift in the daily mobility behaviour.</p><p>Urban mobility management plans are developed by organisations in the public domain (by local and regional authorities) and the private domain (companies, organisations, and institutions) to promote sustainable urban transport as laid out in the Urban Mobility Framework to reach climate neutrality, reduce congestion, air pollutant emissions, noise and other harmful effects of overreliance on fossil fuels-based transport.</p><p>In the context of consultations for the preparation of the new Urban Mobility Framework, the support for mobility management plans has been voiced, with a majority of the respondents being in favour of adopting those plans by 'travel destination? such as organisers of big events, companies with more than 200 employees, universities, shopping centres/retail areas, primary and secondary schools as well as hospitals.</p><p>It is not clear however how many mobility management schemes exist. When they exist, they seem not always fully taken up by their target users. In consequence, they do not lead to the desired behavioural change resulting in a shift towards sustainable mobility choices. Therefore, projects should identify and address specific bottlenecks and barriers that prevent the uptake of sustainable mobility management schemes across the EU and propose solutions that could lead to the desired behaviour change of citizens, aimed at more sustainable and decarbonised urban transport with all its related co-benefits in view of decarbonising the transport sector in line with the European Green Deal.</p><p>A closely related challenge is the uptake of electromobility that requires an increase for clean electricity and the related infrastructure enhancement, notably distribution grids in cities. It is relevant to promote vehicle-to-grid solutions, to alleviate the needs to invest in distribution grid extension. In this regard, behavioural change is key to enable and incentivise electric vehicles users to participate in balancing the grid through smart and bidirectional charging.</p><p>The objective of this topic is to explore, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of mobility management schemes (influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply) in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system. To this end, projects should:</p><ul><li>Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way and provide an overview of mobility managements schemes in the European urban area in both the public and the private domain, which seek to increase the use of sustainable transport modes infrastructure;</li><li>Identify, analyse and assess leverages as well as barriers in the uptake of mobility management schemes for the most important target groups;</li><li>Co-design with and engaging the organisations proposing the mobility schemes, identify and assess potential behaviour-related solutions to those barriers that ensure a successful uptake of mobility management systems. Those solutions should differentiate between specific target groups, in particular students, employees, customers and patients of relevant categories of organisations: schools, universities, hospitals and other health facilities, tourism and leisure sectors, shopping malls, private companies, living in European urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Identify user groups that are more motivated to change their behaviours and prepared to act as frontrunners, thus leading to a more rapid adoption;</li><li>Propose recommendations that support and incentivise the uptake of sustainable mobility choices by organisations and users;</li><li>Propose recommendations to support the uptake of smart and bidirectional recharging for electric vehicles and related demand side management schemes in cities to enable electric vehicles (EV) participation in electricity markets as active customers that can feed the electricity stored in EV batteries back to the power grid during the peak hours to help balance the growing the electricity demand (thus avoiding need for investments into grids);</li><li>Establish incentives to promote renewable based e-mobility schemes notably smart and bidirectional charging in cities to reduce reliance on fossil fuels including via support and awareness raising schemes;</li><li>Encourage new mobility behaviour by means of marketing, information and awareness raising campaigns.</li></ul><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.

R&amp;I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&amp;I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&amp;I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO<sub>2</sub> emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&amp;I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.</p><p>This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.</p><p>This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's <strong>Key Strategic Orientations (KSO)</strong>:</p><ul><li><em>C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;</em></li><li><em>A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy</em>[[<sup></sup><em>'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.</em>]]<em> by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;</em></li></ul><p>It covers the following <strong>impact areas</strong>:</p><ul><li>Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;</li><li>Affordable and clean energy.</li></ul><p>The <strong>expected impact</strong>, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to <em>'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions?</em>, notably through</p><ol> <li>Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable <strong>renewable energy technologies</strong> and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).</li><li>Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply.

They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.</p><p>It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[<sup></sup>Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.</p><p>In line with the 'do not significantly harm? principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.</p><p>Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment.

In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).</p><p>The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral, in current and future climate conditions. R&amp;I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&amp;I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&amp;I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO<sub>2</sub> emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&amp;I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.</p><p>This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.</p><p>This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's <strong>Key Strategic Orientations (KSO)</strong>:</p><ul><li><em>C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;</em></li><li><em>A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy</em>[[<sup></sup><em>'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.</em>]]<em> by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations;</em></li></ul><p>It covers the following <strong>impact areas</strong>:</p><ul><li>Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;</li><li>Affordable and clean energy.</li></ul><p>The <strong>expected impact</strong>, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to <em>'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions?</em>, notably through</p><ol> <li>Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable <strong>renewable energy technologies</strong> and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).</li><li>Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply. This includes more efficient approaches to managing <strong>smart and cyber-secure energy grids</strong> and optimisation the interaction between producers, consumers, networks, infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).</li><li>Accelerating the development of <strong>Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS)</strong> as a CO<sub>2</sub> emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to products) (more detailed information below).</li></ol><p><strong><u>Global leadership in renewable energy</u></strong></p><p>Renewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity, renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.</p><p>It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[<sup></sup>Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.</p><p>In line with the 'do not significantly harm? principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.</p><p>Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.</p><p>All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential, and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.</p><p>Regarding the REPowerEU communication, renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels. Most of the topics in this work programme are centred along two of the REPowerEU tracks, with the remainder of the topics fully contributing to decreasing the EU's dependence on fossil fuels:</p><ul><li><strong>PV, wind energy and heat pumps</strong>, encompassing the most readily available renewable energy technologies to reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels. (17 topics)</li><li><strong>Renewable fuels</strong>, encompassing the most readily available technologies (advanced biofuels) but also the less mature ones (synthetic renewable fuels). Renewable fuels can be used in transport but also in buildings and industry to meet the demand for electricity and heat, therefore displacing fossil fuels. Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication, as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels, and in particular advanced biofuels, contribute to reduce the EU's dependence, because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels, utilizing the existing infrastructure.

It will contribute to the development of a pan European innovation ecosystem and thus to innovation. This portfolio also constitutes the widening dimension of a broader European Excellence Initiative that reaches out beyond this programme as it is implemented in conjunction with ERASMUS+.</p><p>Each of the seven proposed calls addresses a different target group of potential beneficiaries with a customised intervention logic. The use and appropriate design of partnerships with leading institutions abroad will be a key driver for accessing excellence. The intervention logic is designed to work points at a multitude of scales ranging from individual researcher through career development, focused networks, institutional development to a systemic impact on national R&amp;I systems.</p><p>Capacity building will go beyond purely scientific scope as it encompasses the development of management and administrative competencies for the benefit of institutions (notably in Twinning and the European Excellence Initiative) eager to take over consortium leadership roles especially under Pillar 2. Teaming actions will create new or modernise existing centres of excellence by means of close and strategic partnerships with leading institutions abroad. The impact will be amplified by the conditionality of securing complementary investment (especially for infrastructure, building, hardware) from the structural funds or other sources. Once established the centres will function as lighthouses with far reaching impact and role models for attracting the best talents. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the success of modern governance and management, and thus stimulate generalised reforms in the national R&amp;I landscape.</p><p>Two new actions will complement this portfolio as catalysts for better impact and sustainability of the widening actions. The dissemination and exploitation support facility will help beneficiaries of widening actions to improve the effectiveness of their dissemination and exploitation and unlock new sources of funding. The pathways to excellence scheme will unlock synergies of Horizon projects with funds under the cohesion policy in Widening countries.</p><p>In a complementary manner with a focus on the academic and higher education system, the university-related scheme will foster reforms in Widening countries embedded in dynamic university alliances in Europe. Scientific excellence in the more traditional sense is the aim of Twinning where focused networks with excellent partners will develop new promising R&amp;I domains and test novel approaches in smaller joint research projects.</p><p>Innovation excellence is the focus of excellence hubs where innovation ecosystems in Widening countries and beyond will team up and strive to create better links between academia, business, government and society that will foster a real placed-based innovation culture in Widening countries based on a strategic agenda in line with regional or national smart specialisation strategies. In this context, synergies will be sought with the programme parts of the European Innovation Ecosystems and the European Institute of Innovation &amp; Technology (EIT).</p><p>In addition, particular attention will be paid to cross-cutting objectives set for Horizon Europe, such as gender equality and open science practices, through the different funded actions.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contribute to the following expected impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased science and innovation capacity for all actors in the R&amp;I system in Widening countries;</li><li>Structural changes leading to modernised and more competitive R&amp;I systems in eligible countries;</li><li>Reformed R&amp;I systems and institutions leading to increased attractiveness and retention of research talents;</li><li>Mobilisation of national and EU resources for strategic investments;</li><li>Higher participation success in Horizon Europe and more consortium leadership roles;</li><li>Stronger links between academia and business and improved career permeability;</li><li>Strengthened role of the Higher Education sector in research and innovation;</li><li>Greater involvement of regional actors in the R&amp;I process;</li><li>Improved outreach to international level for all actors.</li></ul>",,,

They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.</p><p>It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[<sup></sup>Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.</p><p>In line with the 'do not significantly harm? principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems.

Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication, as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels, and in particular advanced biofuels, contribute to reduce the EU's dependence, because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels, utilizing the existing infrastructure.

They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.</p><p>It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[<sup></sup>Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.</p><p>In line with the 'do not significantly harm? principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.</p><p>Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.</p><p>All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential, and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.</p><p>Regarding the REPowerEU communication, renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels. Most of the topics in this work programme are centred along two of the REPowerEU tracks, with the remainder of the topics fully contributing to decreasing the EU's dependence on fossil fuels:</p><ul><li><strong>PV, wind energy and heat pumps</strong>, encompassing the most readily available renewable energy technologies to reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels. (17 topics)</li><li><strong>Renewable fuels</strong>, encompassing the most readily available technologies (advanced biofuels) but also the less mature ones (synthetic renewable fuels). Renewable fuels can be used in transport but also in buildings and industry to meet the demand for electricity and heat, therefore displacing fossil fuels. Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication, as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels, and in particular advanced biofuels, contribute to reduce the EU's dependence, because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels, utilizing the existing infrastructure. (8 topics)</li><li>The remainder of the topics also contributes to the objective of <strong>decreasing the EU's dependence on fossil fuels,</strong> with the focus either on specific renewable energy sectors (bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean energy and solar thermal) or on cross-technology activities (next generation renewable energy, market measures, international cooperation).
