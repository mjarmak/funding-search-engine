It is continuously being developed through standardisation activities in 3GPP, and new releases with extended features of the standard are approved approximately every 18 to 24 months.To ensure a technological edge in military use of 5G, it is important to capitalise on the continued momentum of new releases and associated features relevant for military operations. In 2016, resilience in civil communication systems was listed by NATO as one of seven baseline requirements that each Member State should measure their level of preparedness. In November 2019, this requirement was updated by NATO Defence Ministers, who stressed the need for reliable communications including 5G.To address this statement and ensure a higher degree of robustness and resilience in military operations when operating in the tactical edge, the militaries should be able to exploit and seamlessly interact with civilian infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted services for tactical command and control applications.This topic focuses on system level integration and orchestration of 5G technologies for seamless interaction of private military and public 5G networks. Hence, the overall objective is to support the need for an always connected concept enabling military applications to roam securely through a mix of private and public networks. To achieve this, there is a need to study, develop and demonstrate how the military can exploit seamless and uninterrupted transfer of secure applications and services in a coverage area served by a mix of private military and public 5G networks, including BLoS (Beyond Line of Sight) through Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) communication systems integrated in 3GPP standard.Specific objectiveThe specific challenge of this topic is to demonstrate robust and dynamic operational capabilities of 5G connectivity solutions matching the military needs for tactical command and control applications and services.The solution should always be connected via a hybrid form of networks, while ensuring secure communications, using tactical networks, private military and public 5G networks and other federation solutions. The use of flexible reach back solutions such as 5G NTN is also necessary to reach shared centralised cloud services.Within this context, secure integration of commercial and military hardware, software and services is a fundamental challenge that must be addressed on both a technological and a commercial level. Scope:Proposals must address the development of either integrated private-public 5G system architectures for military operations, or private military 5G networks, or public 5G services for military applications.Moreover, proposals should lead to the development and demonstration of case-agnostic technical products and services, applicable to military operations across all dimensions of warfare.

EDF-2024-DA-CYBER-NGCR-STEP,Next-Generation Cooperative Cyber Range,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,48000000,48000000,,46905571,46905521EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"Objective:Cyber range technologies have seen notable uptake over the last decade. They form a cornerstone of cyber defence training and testing. The objective of this topic is to take further the ongoing cyber range technology roadmap by designing and implementing next-generation solutions. The key consideration is on the cooperative approach in developing and using those cyber range technologies, thereby facilitating joint capability development.Technological investments and developments have so far mostly focused on various fundamental needs such as visualisation, scoring, realistic scenarios, and federation. Separate mature technological building blocks exist in modern cyber and IT solutions. However, these developments have yet to be consolidated into the context of cyber ranges for defence purposes, in a manner such as the PESCO project Cyber Ranges Federation.Specific objectiveThis topic aims to address the remaining challenge on design and development of solutions that deliver notable progress vis-a-vis the current state-of-the-art, including in view of wider technology landscape. This means that focus has to shift from creating cyber ranges that fulfil basic needs to cyber ranges that target next-level capability requirements. Therefore, the specific objective is about the use of cyber ranges for trainings and exercises. The proposed solutions, however, can benefit also other cyber range use-cases such as product development and penetration testing. Therefore, considerations of such use-cases may be taken into account for developing the solutions. Scope:The next-generation cooperative cyber range capability must address at least the following issues: Set up of trainings and exercises with classified information, especially for cross-border exercises by EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. Although the use of classified information in national exercises and trainings is not a new phenomenon, it is, firstly, still absent from the capabilities of many nations and, secondly, there is no existing solution that offers an EU-wide, cross-border classified capability. Such a capability could help various countries in using this functionality which they otherwise would not be able to use and it would provide a currently unavailable solution to conducting exercises across nations, including for topics such as information sharing and ensuring confidentiality of related data. This would also benefit the EU's military structure, e.g., EU Military Staff, European Defence Agency and others.Moreover, such a capability can be used by nations internally, e.g., for its different security agencies both in defence and national security to increase interoperability. Set up of trainings and exercises covering the entire chain of cyber defence operations from planning through conduct up to review, including by utilising realistic mission networks. Most large-scale technical cyber exercises that are currently conducted do not sufficiently cover all relevant aspects of cyberspace operations. While such aspects are sometimes covered in non-technical exercises, these tend to not sufficiently well incorporate technical cyber defence teams. As a result, truly comprehensive and effective exercises are difficult to deliver.The aspects that surround these technical activities (e.g., operation planning, legal considerations) and which complement incident management (e.g., intelligence activities) require different scenarios and different technical exercise environments in comparison to existing capabilities. The latter also includes the challenge of creating realistic federated mission networks for training purposes.Key aspects in this entire chain are also the analysis of the performance of the cyber operators and the scoring of cyber security situational awareness. Leveraging Artificial Intelligence throughout the delivery of trainings and exercises (e.g., for Blue, Red, White and Green Teams) The use of AI in different phases and parts of cyber exercises and trainings has been researched and developed to an extent. This includes, for example, AI-based scenario generation, and AI-based Red/Blue Teams with hybrid skills (human + AI-based attack/defend strategies (developed in different private companies). AI also plays a pivotal role in generating comprehensive situational awareness for the development of realistic federated missions.In the area of federated missions, which employ multiple teams operating from different locations, AI technologies could help to identify the operational deficiencies within each team member, informing subsequent training customisation and generating tailored scenarios.It is clear that AI can assist in these and in other parts of cyber capability development. The proposals are expected to provide AI-based solutions that target all major parts of cyber exercise and training delivery, as well as AI-based solutions for the performance evaluation of the trainees using the hybrid skills. Set up of trainings and exercises that leverage the concept of digital twins. Digital twins as a concept has a long history. The use of such solutions in cyber exercises has also been targeted previously but not with results that have been sufficiently persistent or useful. Therefore, the challenge remains on developing digital twins or other high-fidelity simulations that have a reasonable cost-effectiveness - given that a common dilemma in such simulations is finding a balance between cost of creating such digital copies and the learning impact that those simulations can offer on top of more standardised ways for IT/OT system and network simulations. One possible avenue for successful balancing of these requirements may be witnessed in the space domain, given its increased need for simulations and testing. Develop or facilitate a framework for accreditation of training centres and personnel skill levels. The solutions should include a proposal on how to establish certified practices for accreditation of training centres (cyber ranges) and skill levels (personal and team certificates). The solution should take into account EU-wide accreditation schemes. However, these should allow for national specificities. Where possible, existing standards, such as relevant NATO practices, should be used. Cross-cutting items All solutions must address the challenge of sharing and pooling cyber range capabilities in a coordinated manner between cyber range providers. This challenge may be best addressed by using and enhancing existing initiatives and projects. Moreover, this sharing and pooling can be demonstrated, for example, via the implementation of the project's solutions in different cyber ranges through federation. If federation as an approach is used, it is expected that the proposals also cover the business and management side of the federation. This could, for example, formalise in the development of model cooperation agreements that mimic actual needs and have been developed with processes similar to actual processes (twin environments).Where existing or new cyber range and cyber exercise standards (e.g., for scenario development and game net creation) are covered, the proposal must address the challenge of achieving a wide user-based of the standard. Proposing the use of any such standards without clearly addressing the way forward may invalidate the whole part of the proposal related to such standards because the success of a standard is as much dependent on the community as the standard's actual content.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

There is also a need to accelerate the acquisition and increase the size of the AIFV fleets updating some of the new requirements stemming from the war in Ukraine and the new threat scenarios. Against this background, the upgrade of the current and development of the next generation armoured infantry fighting vehicle capable of outstanding operational effectiveness and mission success in all possible future scenarios are highly necessary.Modularity, reduced crew workload, the integration of automatic systems, Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T), and increased survivability must guide design considerations.

Furthermore, they must take into account aspects such as mobility, deployability (tactical and strategic ones), autonomy, firepower, maintainability, survivability and cyber security.Thematic scope of the activities to be supported is preliminary studies, system analysis and early development phases. It includes considerations of the system in operational perspective and identification of specific subsystems that define the future operational environment and purpose of system within the future battlefield.Moreover, proposals should include development efforts of a new common European 'Armoured Infantry Fighting Vehicle” (AIFV), and when feasible have a high commonality with solutions in other future European combat vehicles.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

Member States and EDF Associated Countries (MS) have already used various types of MALE RPAS in recent operations to provide detection, identification and communication. MALE RPAS could also have a dual use potential.The EU commonly agreed priorities underline the permanent need to track ships, aircraft and other systems across a wide area of airspace by means of interoperable unmanned surveillance systems capable of operating in all and adverse weather conditions and all types of environments, with assured data integrity. To operate in all types of operational environments, RPAS must be integrated into air traffic management (ATM).As part of a versatile and robust MALE RPAS, the system should consider the option to incorporate the means for an effective neutralisation of targets that posed a threat to the mission being carried out.Today, most of the ISR capabilities of the MS rely on non-EU manufacturers in order to carry out their missions. However, due to the sensitive nature of military operations and the restrictions on technology transfer that prevent MS and EDF Associated Countries from fully benefiting from platform adaptation, the development of a fully European MALE RPAS is key to reduce dependency on non-EU solutions and to ensure sovereignty in this area of ISTAR.It is an overarching objective to strengthen European sovereignty in this strategically relevant area. Hence, this topic is expected to result in a step-changing programme in line with the commonly agreed EU defence objectives and ensuring European strategic autonomy and technological competitiveness in a broad sense.Specific objectiveMALE RPAS reconnaissance includes optical, infrared, radar and signal intelligence sensors and generates geoinformation data. The sensors for optical, infrared and radar reconnaissance are usual configuration parts of a MALE system. As signal intelligence is often classified for national eyes only, it would be preferable to develop a common pod design, which is suitable to contain the national electronics. The integration effort into the MALE system can be shared with a common pod design. This pod design is also a suitable baseline for additional future sensors.The ultimate objective is to develop, produce and sustain a system that provides this critical defence capability to respond to future security challenges.In addition, a strong European supply chain is intended to be developed at all levels to promote the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) in the long term. The supply chain should not be a pre-determined black box, but is expected to be open to competitive suppliers in a largely open tendering process, with the suppliers for mission-critical or security-relevant systems intended to be EU-based. Scope:Proposals must address a prototype of a fully European MALE RPAS with an innovative ISTAR and armed ISTAR capability to exceed the capabilities of comparable current systems and the capabilities of systems available at the entry into service time or, at least, be comparable with them. The prototype must be tested with a view to further qualification and certification activities.Proposals must also address the design and prototype of a common sensor pod for the European MALE RPAS, without affecting the timeline of ongoing activities related to the development of MALE RPAS.In addition, proposals should address the enhancement of a multi-role approach for the MALE RPAS available with different sensor pod configurations.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. It should be noted, however, that large UAS are always challenging to operate due to their specific needs, e.g., regarding facilities, maintenance and support.Anticipated advances in miniaturisation and communication protocols are likely to provide sufficient ground for improvements in the area of small UAS for defence applications and their associated payloads, including weapons, without the stringent need for large UAS. Such activities are embedded in very promising prospects for further industrial and operational development.Against this background, this topic aims to have a direct impact on the tactical operational effectiveness of armed forces in multi-domain operations (air, land and maritime).

However, predicting such effects currently involves a large uncertainty due to the difficulty in estimating the relevant characteristics of these structures. There is therefore a need to efficiently estimate such characteristics from available data such as imagery or documentation and to combine them with effect prediction models to provide reliable predictions. During operations, this should be performed in a limited time and possibly with limited available computing power. This is especially important for relatively large urban areas including many structures.Software solutions for automated structural modelling and effect prediction should therefore be developed. They should offer the best possible accuracy, and trust should be ensured in the measurement of their performances. Given the complexity of the task, they need to rely not only on physics-based models but also on artificial intelligence, and they should be evaluated in an objective manner on data that is representative of the targeted use cases. This involves the collection and annotation of representative data. In order to ensure the reproducibility of experiments and for economic reasons, it is important that such data is reusable for similar developments, including by other technology developers. It also involves the testing of systems on new data using documented metrics and testing protocols, in a way that ensures comparability with similar systems developed by such other actors.Models for the prediction of effects of weapons on structures are often used in conjunction with other models in decision support tools, for example to estimate freedom of manoeuvre or effectiveness of communication. Scalability and compatibility with such other models and tools should therefore be ensured. Scope:Proposals must address the development and evaluation of software systems for modelling structures from multisource imagery and other relevant available data, and for accurately predicting the effects of weapons on these structures. This includes the collection of relevant databases for training and testing the systems.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

Within these quantum technologies, Quantum Sensing (QS) is one of the most mature domains and has the potential to notably impact defence operations. Nevertheless, significant technical challenges remain before operational systems can be developed. Further research is therefore needed in a range of QS domains such as quantum sensors for Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), optronics and RF sensing. Besides, with the possible emergence of quantum computers, current technologies for secure communications face a risk of becoming compromised and need to be upgraded. There is therefore a need for research on technologies future-proof communication technologies such as quantum communication or quantum-resistant cryptography. Scope:The proposals must address at least one of the following technological domains: Quantum sensing technologies for PNT The proposals should address quantum sensing technologies with the potential to improve PNT capabilities, such as high performances atomic clocks, quantum inertial sensors and gravimeters, and solid-state quantum vector magnetometers. Specific enabling technologies for improving size, weight and power (SWaP), to increase efficiency and/or ruggedness while lowering the overall footprint, should be addressed. Quantum technologies for optronics and RF sensing The proposals should address quantum technologies with a potential to improve imaging and optronic sensors by exploiting quantum properties such as superposition, tunnelling and entanglement. In particular, technologies exploiting single photon detection and its processing for seeing behind obstacles in non-line-of-sight configuration and/or in degraded visual environment, such as smoke and dust fog, should be addressed.The proposals should also address quantum technologies with a potential to improve RF sensing and electronic warfare, such as ensembles of atoms in Rydberg state or superconducting quantum devices exploiting interference effects as well as colour centres in crystals or other quantum approaches.

EDF-2024-DA-C4ISR-AIMA-STEP,AI-based multifunctional aperture and transceiver,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,45000000,45000000,,46905571,46905501EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"Objective:To cope with multi-dimensional warfighting environments, modern militaries need relevant situational awareness across all domains. They also need to be able to both operate cross-domain capabilities, such as any-sensor-to-any-shooter networking, and prevent the enemy from doing so. This requires communications systems that can perform ad hoc networking in all domains in dynamically evolving tactical situations. Currently, this is done with mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) data links.As wireless solutions such as the Internet of Battlefield Things proliferate, the electromagnetic spectrum is likely to become an increasingly important source of situational awareness. Passive electronic monitoring, detection, classification and localisation of enemy radio frequency emitters is part of the recognised situational picture. Traditionally, this has been the task of electronic warfare (EW) units and their specific equipment providing electronic support (ES) to combat units.To counter a detected threat, forces can use kinetic- (KE) and directed-energy (DE) means with their weapon systems, or electronic protection (EP) and attack (EA) if they have jamming systems, traditionally equipment carried and used by dedicated EW units. Before directing fire at detected targets, soldiers must mitigate the risk of friendly fire. At long ranges and in poor visibility, this requires radio communications with either self-positioning based Blue Force Tracking (BFT) or interrogation-based Identification Friend or Foe (IFF).Today, MANET data links, ES receivers, jammers, BFT and IFF are separate pieces of equipment requiring decentralised control, separate installation space, power supply, cabling, antennas, etc. By combining these functionalities into a single autonomously controlled equipment, it would be possible to achieve better performance, higher reliability, lower weight and lower life cycle costs.In addition to the aforementioned technological reasons for converged aperture, there is also a need for converged systems. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is expected to continue to be contested, congested and constrained. Military use of the EMS is under serious pressure from the civil community. Civilian, dual-use and military applications intermingle in the EMS currently in use, challenging the freedom and security of operation (OPSEC) of military users. With Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, systems are likely to be able to dynamically perform mission and threat analysis, situational awareness, positioning and navigation, and jamming. This means dynamic adaptation to prevailing conditions at machine speed. This would require AI-based operation at the device and system of systems (fleet/network) level in order to coordinate actions of several systems with minimal detectability and platform losses.Specific objectiveThe specific objective of this topic is to design, develop and build a system that should:Accelerate command and control (C2) and enhance operational effectiveness by providing cross-domain mobile ad-hoc networking capabilities to the armed forces.Increase lethality by enabling faster firing and reducing the risk of collateral damages, including fratricide, by providing the means to detect and target the enemy and to locate, track and identify friendly forces.Reduce enemy lethality and increase own protection by avoiding detection with AI-based emission control, stealthy waveforms and by jamming enemy communications.Provide autonomous mission management of several systems (including detection, jamming and targeting) within the network in order to improve survivability, and autonomously take actions to meet the mission objectives with the aid of AI.Be capable of operating in all weather conditions, in particular in the challenging Arctic environment and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied areas. Scope:Proposals must address study, development and qualification of new generation scalable and cognitive (AI-controlled) multifunctional software defined (SD) transceiver for military use in manned and unmanned platforms. The ultimate objective of the proposals must be to achieve a qualified prototype for end-user demonstrations with a view to obtain end-user commitment for operational use.Proposals may also provide a framework for the development of new standards, including proposals for intelligent and effective spectrum management, and prepare to contribute to future standards.

This type of battlefield, previously purely oil-based from cradle to grave, to integrate energy management technologies, buffer storage resources and a camp/weapon system interface in a constrained and contested tactical environment, is in need of a comprehensive review of its energy production and distribution. It requires the implementation of a coherent and efficient energy network, from the energy production systems at operational level to the soldiers at tactical level, through all the layers of the distribution systems.In parallel, the EU defence sector has to start its digital and green energy transition to contribute to the EU net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and to anticipate growing energy costs linked to the vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies becoming increasingly scarce and disputed.This development entails major risks for military activities. The multiplication of low-carbon energy sources and the risk of more complex logistics are an additional challenge for manoeuvres. It is also an opportunity to meet the growing demand for future weapons systems, platforms and devices.An energy-independent and energy efficient deployable military camp, as part of the future electric battlefield, is the first step towards an operational and tactical integrated energy supply chain. It serves as a starting point, hub for innovative electric energy generation and efficient distribution throughout all levels. This includes initial definitions of interface between the stationary components (operational level) and the mobile components (tactical level) of the electric battlefield.As the role of the military camps, as an energy provider has been emphasised, scaling-up of its technological bricks (energy generation, storage and distribution) needs to be amplified while covering a wide range of operational scenarios.Specific objectiveThe specific objective of this topic is to substitute the fossil fuel dependency reduction in military deployable camps (support and mobility) without any drop of operational performances, in a context of increasing electrical energy demand in the battlefield. Moreover, investigation on the return of experience of the demonstration stage, should include specifications of a whole concept of energy independent and efficient deployable camps.

Studies to evaluate hospital preparedness have shown that good response plans can be developed for complex medical training scenarios (such as radiation exposure response), and that medical providers can be trained to follow these plans if the given training is realistic in its delivery.Effective military medical training and readiness for PFC require decision training, performance of individual medical procedures and excellent teamwork skills in austere conditions of fast changing battlefield conditions of large-scale symmetrical conflict or natural disaster. Military medical training based on both computer-generated, hybrid and physical teaching materials creates advantage to development of cost-effective training courses for the military and civilian medical (support) personnel population and paramedics.European Union has already started its efforts for developing military medics' innovative training solutions, focused on Field Care and Role 1 scenarios. In order to take full advantage of military medics training simulation, additional operational scenarios and functionalities in a virtual reality environment have to be developed and integrated into a network of federated toolbox which provides interconnection and joint access to simulation systems that are supporting different but mutually complementing simulation methods like mixed, augmented, hybrid, part task trainers, logistics, manikins and medical equipment, but currently are unevenly distributed in the European market for the medical personnel and paramedic training.Specific objectiveThe topic aims to address the current operational challenges facing military medical personnel in the EU Member States (MS) and EDF Associated Countries, including in and out of areas of deployment. Scope:Proposals must address the development of a prototyped solution for a federation of available and enhanced medical simulation systems that support military medical curriculum and are connected to a (at best AI-based) feedback system (that may include real medical and health-data as benchmarking) that enables to see integrated picture of all training related information.Proposals must therefore address:Medical Training Modules: The Medical Training Modules are designed to impart knowledge in military medicine to trainees. At present, the guidelines are anchored in Tactical Combat Casualty Care, serving as vital training curricula for both medical and non-medical personnel in civilian and military contexts. Looking ahead to future battlefield situations, insights from Ukraine underscore the importance of updating existing guidelines with a Prolonged Casualty Care environments. This adaptation is essential in preparing Europeans to confront diverse battlefield scenarios. Training modules can provide realistic, scenario-based learning experiences covering trauma, infections, and radiation exposure. They extend across various environments, including battlefield tranches, vehicles, and aircraft, offering comprehensive multi-modal and interdisciplinary training. The integration of virtual and mixed technologies elevates the delivery of educational content and learning retention. The overarching focus is effective communication, coordination, and preparedness for non-medical professionals in dynamic settings of the battlefield.Supporting elements enabling Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network: The Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network employs advanced technologies to create a comprehensive and realistic training environment. This includes cloud-based solutions for simultaneous management of large casualties, integration of digital computer simulated casualties for dynamic scenarios, physical simulated patients for hands-on training, and physical manikin systems replicating human responses. Crucially, seamless data exchange between computer-generated simulations and physical systems ensures a cohesive training experience. The interconnected federated network allows collaborative exercises across different locations, with real-time monitoring and feedback enhancing the learning process. Scalability, customisation, and integration of virtual, mixed, and augmented reality technologies contribute to an immersive and adaptable training platform for military non-medical and medical professionals.Integration with Real World: The integration of 5G technology into medical education signifies a transformative approach for European Union medical training centres. This integration facilitates the delivery of educational content with high-speed, low-latency connectivity, enabling real-time and immersive learning experiences. Learning analytics tools add a data-driven dimension, offering insights into individual and collective learning patterns. Augmented reality serves as a powerful teaching aid, particularly for Definitive Surgical Trauma Care, enhancing trainees' understanding through virtual overlays in the real-world environment. This comprehensive integration fosters scalable and distributed training solutions, promotes remote collaboration, and ensures standardisation and quality assurance across diverse training centres. The result is a cutting-edge educational paradigm that leverages advanced technologies to elevate the efficiency, accessibility, and effectiveness of medical training throughout the European Union. In addition, the proposals must address concept development for interconnectivity of Military Medical VR Training Simulation Modules to a Battle Management System's simulation, including interface to a MS Battle Management System's simulation.Moreover, proposals should address how real data and AI can be used to create an as realistic as possible environment facing medical, medical logistic and C2 challenges and provide suggestions to improve real life scenarios.In addition, proposals may address the analysis of trainees' stress levels and hesitations and provides feedback.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

It enables to gather strategic and operational information on facilities, vehicles and forces on the ground and on the seas with a good geographic coverage across the Earth, and to assess the status of suspicious or hostile activities.Satellite imagery analysis has long relied on traditional techniques, but the ever-increasing amounts of available satellite images has led to a need for automated analysis technologies. These technologies have been the subject of much research over several decades, and the steady progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular of AI-based image recognition has led to new tools appearing on the market. However, much of the development work and technological challenges in this field have focused on image types other than satellite images, and there is a need to foster the progress of satellite image analysis technologies. In this context, the general objective of this call topic is to enhance these technologies by giving research teams the opportunity to benefit from the organisation of a technological challenge dedicated to them.Specific objective Optical and radar images of a given geographic area contain complementary information. While these different types of images result from very different physical principles, which make their combination quite challenging, such a combination can lead to improved information extraction and capabilities. This call topic therefore aims at progressing information fusion approaches towards this objective. Scope:The proposals must address technological solutions to detect, identify and characterise relevant information from multi-source satellite images, in particular by taking advantage of the complementarity of optical and radar images.

Undoubtedly, UxVs exploitation is likely to grow in the coming years with the massive introduction of other autonomous systems in different domains (land, air, sea, space, cyber) and the increase of capabilities to work collaboratively between systems (swarms) and people.Indeed, intelligent and effective cooperation between military assets (UxVs, different types of vehicles and their operators, and dismounted soldiers) within Close Combat Operations is needed to increase the overall Battlespace effectiveness, while reducing loss of life, the risk of collateral damage and lowering the cognitive burden placed upon operators.Therefore, deploying autonomous and swarm-based military assets in a framework of cooperation between manned and unmanned systems (manned-unmanned teaming) is a very important capability that can enable enhanced ISTAR, survivability, situation awareness, mobility, lethality, logistics and training, and increase the probability of battlefield combat success.This would allow the rapid development of capacities implying an incremental approach of capabilities milestones for current and future land systems and upgrades of legacy systems.Specific objectiveThe use of such UxV systems has a direct impact in reducing the exposure of human operators and soldiers to associated risks. Such systems can radically improve the efficiency and performance of the tactical unit to provide tactical/ operational superiority and offer robust and reliable solutions in very demanding conditions.Thus, the aim of this topic is to develop an unmanned modular system of systems capable of supporting dismounted, mechanised and motorised infantry in all types of European geographic and operational land environments, including denied environments, in adverse light and weather conditions with evolving levels of autonomy and robustness.The overarching goal of this topic is to contribute to the maturing, testing and verification of the Unmanned Ground Systems (UGS) capability, so that the technology is expected to be ready for integration into the European armed forces by 2030.

In particular, it is essential for Member States' armed forces to provide combat units with increased engagement capabilities without being spotted and with a high level of success and survivability.Specific objectiveBeyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) engagement is the capability of firing at a target not directly seen by the effector, based on information given by a remote sensor. The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) capability offers tactical advantages, as mobile units acquire an increased engagement capability with higher kill probability and without being spotted by the adversary.To succeed in a BLOS-firing mission, reconnaissance, intelligence, and adequate preparations is likely essential. A technical system design (i.e., incorporating command and control, mobility, survivability, lethality, intelligence and endurance) for BLOS must be versatile against future alterations pending an evolving hostile threat. A BLOS system design therefore needs to be future-proof regarding robustness and security to motivate investments in resources and funds for the anticipated period of life.In this context, some requirements are becoming increasingly important: provide the land and coastal combat units with an increased engagement capability and with a very high degree of success and survivability; discriminate between threats that are not always clearly identified and visible before firing; defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment; avoid widespread collateral damage; providing conditions for a high level of survivability by low exposure as well as reachability with precision strikes over an area.

Therefore, the main objective of this topic is to identify, define, design, and develop them, to be integrated on future European naval platforms.The topic should act as a real enabler for both the European naval industry and the EU Navies. In that context, it should be very inclusive to be adapted to the most European Navies' needs for their future naval platforms. It will allow EU Navies to remain at the forefront of technology, to maximise interoperability and the survivability by design, to operate with technological superiority, and to increase EU strategic autonomy. At industrial level, this topic should be an instrument for the European industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies.Specific objectiveThe specific objective of this topic is to define the common operational requirements of the System of Systems (SoS) framework and the essential elements of the next generation of European naval platforms. Such a SoS framework is expected to embrace the supporting infrastructure including interfaces, data, and common and specific services. It must identify the technological needs for the future development of European naval platforms with special attention on emerging technologies, promising solutions, and the increased resilience of naval vessels when facing the most sophisticated threats by near real-time evaluation of survivability.In particular, the topic should contribute to solve these specific challenges:The capability to operate interconnected in a fully integrated way, under challenging multi-domain (i.e., land, aerial, surface, subsurface and cyber) threat conditions.The definition and the design of the core architecture of the future European naval platforms by a SoS approach.The analysis of naval vessels survivability aspects on an operational level, considering its three key aspects (i.e., susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability) under an integral approach, leading to a resilient ship. This topic aims to identify and define essential elements for future European naval platforms as functional system building blocks by specifying a full set of new technologies, solutions, and systems to be fitted on board, covering the following main areas:Four pillars:Combat System. New threats based on emerging technologies lead to the development of combat systems with enhanced sensors collaborating under an extended top-side concept that increase the detection capability, in time and accuracy, as well as new weapons/effectors able to face them, based on decision making algorithms to allow shorter reaction time to engage those threats. The UxVs are to be integrated into the Combat System as an extension of the detection and defence capability. In terms of survivability, specific challenges to susceptibility are the required countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, together with the ability to predict and manage where a missile or a torpedo might impact the vessel, as an important interface between susceptibility and vulnerability. UxVs should be also analysed in relation to ship survivability.Communication and Information System. Solutions need to be sought to meet emerging challenges in this area such as the management of a big volume of data transmitted at high speed (comparable to 5G and ahead) in a very demanding operational theatre, the integrity and cybersecurity of the data, and the EU naval tactical cloud integrated in a military multidomain operations cloud. Special consideration should be made on anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) scenarios, defining embarked cloud capabilities to support the edge operation of joint forces overseas. Attention must also be paid to complete loss of connectivity due to denial or due to stealth reasons.Enhanced Platform Management System. New threats and evolving technologies should lead to redefine the current concept of naval platforms to ensure enough and adequate power generation, as well as a proper top-side compatible with new weapons and UxV launch and recovery systems (LARS) on board. In the same way, future naval platforms should address efficient platform control and management, as well as increased power supply needs for future weapons and sensors, and new energy technologies to achieve the European Green Deal objectives. In addition, ship signature management, smart damage control, and survivability aspects should be considered because countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, or the impact of hypersonic missile or torpedo affect the vulnerability of the platform (e.g., a successful hard-kill engagement might result in debris hitting the ship, the success soft-kill deployments strongly affect the ship signatures). The impact of such events should be studied, and technical solutions to withstand the physical and system damage should be identified.Navigation System. Solutions should be sought for increased safety during navigation, independent satellite positioning system, accurate inertial navigation system, autonomous operations and multi-manned and unmanned, underwater, surface, and aerial vehicles coordinated navigation.One transversal area linked to the four pillars:Survivability Advisory System Foundation. The evolving threat landscape should result in a need for an advisory capability to assist in the setting of the ship signature management system, the deployment of hard-kill and soft-kill countermeasures, the adjustment of the ship's signature for hit-point management, the post-hit damage assessment, the remaining capability including strength and systems, and the deployment of recovery actions to regain functionality. This should also allow for future task group advisory capabilities, where high value assets should be protected by the task group, and the survivability of the task group is expected to be optimised due to advice across the task group. Proposals should design a SoS framework: Solutions should be sought based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution, that might sustain the above-mentioned areas. It should include transversal capabilities like for instance, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Based Decision Making, Digital Twin, Federated Mission Networking, Through-Life Support based on virtual reality and remote systems monitoring, Cyberwarfare, or Survivability Scope:Proposals must address:The definition of common operational requirements of the essential elements for the future European naval platforms, covering the main areas (i.e., Combat System, Communication and Information System, Enhanced Platform Management System and Navigation System) under an integral survivability approach (i.e., Survivability Advisory System Foundation);The development of a concept of a SoS framework, typically based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution that might sustain the concerned areas;The definition of a modular, interoperable, scalable, and flexible concept design to support an architecture that should provide a versatile solution for answering future Navies´ needs and trends;The identification of emerging technologies that should respond to the operational needs of the future naval platforms, including integrated operational data-, messaging-, telecom-communication systems;The design of a tool for the management of the ship signature while advising on the status and solutions for timely and accurate deployment of countermeasures, both active (e.g., advanced jammers, signature manipulators) and passive (e.g., flares, chaff, corner cubes), coordinated with hard-kill solutions, and including the prediction and management of the hit-point;The assessment of existing solutions and the consideration of new damage control systems where appropriate through automated systems, crew actions, and recovery of systems, while performing predictions of the state of the ship after incidents, likely based on AI that processes sensor readings/information and imaging;The design of an operational guidance system to support the Navigation System for ship operations with a damaged and undamaged ship (e.g., advice for helicopter operations, UxV deployment);The identification of the priorities on technologies to be further develop in the future, as well as the level of maturity to be achieved for the associated elements;The analysis of a tool for the European naval industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies;The operational assessment and the analysis of the technical viability, as well as the evaluation of the feasibility of the baseline concepts;The design of a joint technology demonstrator and to de-risk potential further activities in the future.

EDF-2024-DA-SPACE-EPW-STEP,Secure waveform for satellite communications,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,25000000,25000000,,46905571,46905526EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"Objective:In today's military applications supported by satellite communications, security, information assurance and link efficiency are inextricably linked. Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today's military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).Specific objectiveThis topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.3/ Flexibility and scalability The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.4/ Innovation The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.5/ Security and resilience The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available. Scope:Proposals must address system prototyping of the baseband equipment (satellite modem), the on-board satellite active transponder and ancillary systems, as well as the testing of all prototypes (modems, on board active transponders and ancillary systems) operating the EPW in a controlled and operational military environment.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

Functional requirementsThe proposed product and technologies should meet the following functional requirements:System requirements:The EPW should be accessible to small, mid-sized and large Member States and EDF Associated Countries seeking to embrace today's and future challenges related to increased throughput demand over satellite, dispersed theatres, joint operations, mobility and new security threats;In accordance with this integrated multi-layered security and resiliency approach for military satellite networks, the EPW development should fulfil requirements at the level of the waveform, the baseband equipment (terminals, modems, hubs, networks) and end-to-end satellite network level including multi-band/multi-frequency terminals, anti-jamming technologies, interference mitigation, network diversity, network security and cyber technologies.

As such, an overall approach needs to be envisaged to align the EPW development with the complementary security and resiliency technologies for ground and space segments, leading to the following additional requirements:The EPW should be integrated into a larger multi-layered security & resilience architecture that:Contains anti-jamming technologies that allow to detect, mitigate, prevent and predict jamming efforts by 3rd party adversaries.

Fixed, on-the-move and on-the-pause land-based and maritime terminals, man packs and antenna systems, including airborne terminals and antenna systems installed on rotatory wings (RW), need to be considered as well as different types of antenna technologies (e.g., parabolic, electronically steered, phased array, flat antennas, etc.). The secure connection and interface between antenna system and baseband needs to be taken into account as well;Includes network and ground segment technologies that improve the cyber hardening of all satellite vulnerable subsystems including protection against possible hacking, network intrusion, etc.Includes protection technologies against hostile action (e.g., jammers, intrusion and eavesdropping) for critical satellite datalinks, improving signals protection and integrity;Provides future proof interfaces and complementarity to upcoming disruptive security technologies such as quantum-safe encryption, self-healing networks, etc.;Is open towards upcoming and existing EU-based pooling and sharing programs (e.g., GovSatCom) and satellite constellations (EU Secure Space Connectivity System initiative currently under study) and ready to be integrated in these concepts.

These types of assets and the technologies that go with them have the potential to offer a diverse mission set, minesweeping being one of them. The maritime drones and their payloads currently used and integrated by the navies operate with different levels of autonomy and endurance. This topic aims to enhance naval minesweeping capabilities by pushing the design and level of the autonomy of particularly maritime drones. Furthermore, this topic addresses sweep gear and sweep sources for minesweeping operations adjoining the higher level of autonomy. In this context the drone/platform and its payload/sweeping gear form the minesweeping system.Minesweeping is traditionally performed using mechanical or influence sweep sources towed behind a highly specialised and expensive crewed platform (minesweeper). Evolving technologies, such as autonomous features, offer new solutions to the minesweeping systems. These solutions in concert with new operational concepts offer European navies the opportunity to maximise the benefits of common development. Typically, a distinction can be made between drones with towed signature sources and those with integrated sources installed aboard.The size and capability of a minesweeping drone and its payload are defined by the operational needs. These needs vary in environmental aspects from inshore operations with short transit and limited operation times in sheltered areas to operations in unsheltered areas potentially exposed to heavy wind and large waves with long standoff distances. The variation in operational needs with respect to the subject of protection can be from smaller merchant vessels and military vessels with reduced underwater signatures to large civilian merchants with significant underwater signatures.The underwater signature and the shock resistance of the minesweeping system is a crucial part of its design and a fundamental feature of minesweeping operations.The objective of this call is to reach at least technology readiness level 6 for a minesweeping system (platform/drone and payload designed for it). Scope:The proposals must target minesweeping systems (platform/drone and payload/sweeping gear) with autonomous features that are capable of performing influence sweeping in open-sea conditions against mines that target large merchant vessels (such as Landing Platform Dock (LPD), Ro-Ro vessels etc. up to around 200m length). The proposals must investigate and develop capable and cost-effective drone systems for influence minesweeping. This includes the interfaces to enabling systems such as launch and recovery (LARS) of the sweep system and command and control (C2) systems (including planning and evaluation tools).The proposals may include solutions that include modified mechanical minesweeping operations.Furthermore, the proposals must address reducing time (improved effectiveness) and risk for personnel and materiel in minesweeping operations. Development of uncrewed systems and autonomous features are seen as enablers in this regard. Improvements must address at least vehicle design regarding underwater signatures, propulsion system, and shock resistance to benefit both operational quality and efficiency. Improvements should also address features such as low maintenance effort, survivability, endurance, and modularity.The proposals should address multi-purpose functions with the aim of supporting additional Naval Warfare operations, such as, but not limited to, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Maritime Evacuation Operations. This may imply that features, such as, but not limited to, LARS, interaction with several autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), operation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments, towing of sonar systems, and use of mine disposal systems are incorporated.The outcome should benefit a European interoperable and interchangeable NMCM Future Sweeping System designed with incremental capabilities to counter current and new mine threats consisting of enhanced intelligent platforms.

In recent years, the opportunities offered by Systems-On-a-Chip have become very apparent in many different technology sectors such as telecommunications, military, automotive, financial, medical research, and others.Fundamental to this development is the integration of processing hardware, embedded programming software and firmware and high-speed digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital technology with low power consumption technology into a single component.There is a need to invest in a European RF-CMOS supply chain and measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations connected to military applications. Building on the learnings from the GaN-supply chain cooperation, and based on the growing demand for integrated circuits, a European supply chain initiative, catalysed by military needs, is likely to become a very important tool for future European prosperity and for ensuring a long-term strategy of non-dependence for critical defence technologies.Specific objectiveThis topic aims to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply and to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies.

EDF-2024-RA-SIMTRAIN-BRG-STEP,Methods for bridging reality gaps,EDF-RA EDF Research Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,15000000,15000000,,46905660,46905650EDFResearchActions1718841600000,"Objective:Mission planning and execution in the present and future multi-domain operation environment (MDO) employing manned and unmanned force elements demand that the human decision makers are very well supported to be able to handle the complexity and dynamics of the battlespace and make decisions faster and better than the adversary.In mission planning different types of operational capabilities need to be carefully coordinated in time and space to achieve mission goals and counter expected threats. Labour intensive manual planning is infeasible within the constraints of available time and resources. The general objective is to develop advanced automated support tools for the generation and evaluation of courses of action (COAs) in an MDO context. The toolset is expected to support wargaming of the candidate COAs to ensure that commanders and staff can assess the plan and options in detail before final decision making.Specific objectiveThis call aims to explore technologies, concepts, products, processes and services towards a common simulation framework for wargames/combat simulations with the potential to facilitate reinforcement learning for mission planning and execution support.Re-planning and decision-making during mission execution are likely to be challenged in the interconnected, manned-unmanned, automated and high-speed battlespace. In the future, the clear distinction between mission planning and execution is expected to be challenged by exploiting battlespace information and predictive capabilities. Proper support is needed to speed up the OODA-loop to outpace the adversary in the planning phase as well as in the execution phase.The development and use of a computer-based decision support system that leverages AI, machine learning, wargames/combat simulations and digital twins of the battlespace has the potential to change the military planning and decision-making concept of operations (CONOPS).Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown a huge potential for solving planning problems in civilian applications. However, despite its headline success in video games, strategy games and other planning domains over the last few years, RL is not making similar progresses in the realm of wargames/combat simulations for military operations planning. Videogames leave a lot of margin when it comes to critical (life or death) simulation. Nevertheless, if access to classified data from the field is not possible, videogames data may be used for a proof of concept. Simulation frameworks tailored to particular domains have played a major role in facilitating reinforcement learning in those domains, as witnessed by the impact of e.g., OpenAI Gym and the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).A common simulation framework for wargames/combat simulations has the potential of similarly facilitating reinforcement learning-support in mission planning and execution.As it is related to EUDIS, this topic aims to support, in addition to the research activities, the creation of an innovation test hub in the field of simulation and training. To achieve this objective, financial support to third parties (cascade funding) (FSTP) is included as part of the grant. This should increase the opportunities for various smaller actors, including those not previously active in the defence sector, to adapt innovative simulation technologies for defence applications and to identify potential business opportunities in the defence sector. Scope:Proposals must address studies and design of a reinforcement learning environment/testbed or framework for training of AI agents to develop courses of actions in mission planning, including a flexible and open combat simulation framework fit for RL. It must address the need for rapid and user-friendly creation of scenarios, considering commander's objectives and intent, rules of engagement and other mission constraints (e.g., speed, resources, attrition). It must also include studies and design of a combat simulation system (not necessarily the same used for AI agent training) including trained AI agents to support mission planning. For the support to mission execution the scope includes studies and design of a digital twin of the ongoing mission for prediction and decision-making support. The proposal must establish a proof-of-concept demonstrator for verification, validation and demonstration.The learning environment, including the combat simulation framework must be flexible and adaptive for different scenarios and domains. It must take advantage of open standards and open-source frameworks both within AI, simulation technologies (including C2-Simulation interoperability) and mission sensor and mission data to the digital twin.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

There is a need for exchange of classified information in MUS. Identification, authentication and authorisation are important functionalities in the field of digital trusted gateways. Further research needs to be done to overcome the physical characteristics of the underwater environment that limits the possibility of having wireless communication systems with sufficient robustness and bandwidth required by many underwater warfare functions.The specific objective is to design and demonstrate feasibility of secured (communications security COMSEC and transmission security TRANSEC) underwater (network) communication solutions (acoustic, optical, or other modalities) for UUSs designed for military needs. Scope:The proposals must address research of secure underwater communication, with focus on acoustic technologies, including networked solutions, that contribute to the improvement of current performance, through the creation of new low-distortion modulation techniques, interference avoidance/suppression mechanisms, recovery from fading, etc. This requires the communication to be highly adaptive and self-reconfigurable. To improve the performance of the acoustic underwater communication channel, the environmental conditions in situ, such as noise, depth, sound velocity profile, etc., must be considered.Furthermore, research in underwater communication, with focus on optical technologies, must be addressed, with the aim of improving bandwidth and transmission distance, reducing signal distortion, in order to improve communication within and between platforms, networks and infrastructures.The security aspects should be included in the underwater communication systems. The challenging communication conditions (low data rate, long latency, delay and Doppler spread effects, highly varying channel conditions and high noise levels, etc), which may result in unreliable and low-bandwidth communication links, also give special challenges for security mechanisms. This should be taken into account in the design of the complete communication system (modulations, network protocols, etc), carefully balancing modular/layered approaches and cross-layer approaches. During the design, performance metrics describing efficiency and robustness should always be assessed, to avoid that this gets too much compromised by the security measures. Also, encryption methods should be considered in order to obtain metrics about its efficiency. Different encryption methods can be used depending on the mission state, data classification level, etc.The suggested design solutions should be tested in a realistic environment in salt water.Types of activitiesThe following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional (see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation): Types of activities (art 10(3) EDF Regulation) Eligible?

Scope:Proposals should cover both the organisation of the European Researchers' Night and the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative.The European Researchers' Night takes place every year, on the last Friday of September[1]. It supports events that can last up to two days: they can start on Friday and continue the following day. Pre-events, prior to the main event, and related post-events, such as wrap-up meetings or small-scale follow-up events, can also be organised. It is the occasion for a Europe-wide public and media event for the promotion of research careers.The European Researchers' Night targets the general public, addressing and attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a special focus on young people and their families, pupils and students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities.The Researchers at Schools initiative brings researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to interact with pupils on societal challenges and on the key role of research to address them. Pupils will thus also learn directly about research projects and initiatives related to EU main priorities.Types of activitiesEuropean Researchers' Night activities can combine education with entertainment, especially when addressing young audiences. They can take various forms, such as exhibitions, hands-on experiments, science shows, simulations, debates, games, competitions, quizzes, etc. Where appropriate, engagement with educational institutions should be sought in order to encourage formal and informal science education with the aim of improving the scientific knowledge base. The European Researchers' Night should be highlighted as a European (and Europe-wide) event, and each proposal should promote the European Union and its impact on citizens' daily life in the most appropriate way, according to the set-up and the configuration of the event, its location and its activities.Researchers at Schools activities will allow researchers to showcase their work and interact with pupils. Researchers will engage with teachers, educators and pupils on challenges related to climate change, sustainable development, health and other issues related to the European Commission priorities and main orientations, such as the European Green Deal or the EU Missions. The Researchers at Schools activities should take place at any time during the project duration and should be subject to a dedicated promotion, particularly towards schools and other pedagogical and educational centres.Involvement of researchers funded by Horizon Europe or previous Framework Programmes, notably by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, is highly encouraged.Both the European Researchers' Night and Researchers at Schools initiative should promote gender balance, diversity and inclusiveness in science in terms of planned activities and researchers involved.The European Commission has defined priorities, notably through the EU Missions, which aim to tackle challenges faced by our societies. Applicants are encouraged to focus on, and include activities relating to these priorities identified by the Missions in their events.Partnerships and coordination at regional, national or cross-border levels will be strongly encouraged aiming at a good geographical spread and avoiding overlaps. Activities carried-out in non-associated third countries are not eligible for funding.High-quality applications not retained due to lack of funding may be granted the status of associated events.Eligible costs will take the form of lump sum contributions as stipulated in Decision of 11 March 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions and unit contributions for Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions under the Horizon Europe Programme.Applicants are encouraged to submit proposals covering activities for both 2026 and 2027, including the organisation of two successive editions[2] (2026 and 2027) of the European Researchers' Night and implementation of Researchers at Schools activities during the project duration. [1] Except for countries which for strong cultural reasons would be prevented from organising any action addressing the public at large on such a date.[2]The expected contribution for projects covering two editions of the European Researchers' Night and Researchers at Schools activities is between EUR 0.1 and 0.3 million, but this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting different amounts.",,"MSCA and Citizens aims to bring research and researchers closer to the public at large, to increase awareness of research and innovation activities and to boost public recognition of science and research education. It will show the role of the researcher for the society and economy, as well as the impact of researchers' work on citizens' daily lives. It also aims to raise the interest of young people in research and scientific careers.MSCA and Citizens will address the general public, attracting people regardless of the level of their scientific background, with a specific focus on families, pupils, students, and notably those who do not have easy access to, and thus are less inclined to engage in, STEAM fields (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) or research activities. Inclusiveness should be key, in view of broadening access to science and research to all.MSCA and Citizens should also promote gender balance and inclusiveness in science, Open Science, and Responsible Research and Innovation.These objectives will be pursued through the organisation of the European Researchers' Night and the implementation of the Researchers at Schools initiative. The European Researchers 'Night is the largest research communication and promotion event taking place across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries.The Researchers at Schools initiative aims to strengthen the connection between research and education, by bringing researchers to schools and other pedagogical and educational centres to encourage interaction with pupils at all levels of primary and secondary education.

Scope:MSCA Staff Exchanges involve organisations from the academic and non-academic sectors (including SMEs) from across the globe.Support is provided for international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary mobility of R&I staff leading to knowledge transfer between participating organisations.Mobility through secondmentsThe organisations constituting the partnership contribute directly to the implementation of a joint R&I project by seconding and/or hosting eligible staff members. Such a project must explore activities that can be based on previous work but should go beyond and generate or strengthen long-term collaborations. Secondments must involve physical mobility[1] of the eligible staff members and must always take place between legal entities independent from each other.MSCA Staff Exchanges can address three dimensions of mobility: international, inter-sectoral and interdisciplinary[2]. While exchanges between organisations within EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries should mainly be inter-sectoral, same-sector exchanges[3] are also possible under the condition that they are interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinarity is not required for same-sector exchanges with non-associated Third Countries.Secondments between institutions established in non-associated Third Countries or within the same EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country are not eligible.The collaborative approach of MSCA Staff Exchanges should exploit complementary competences of the participating organisations and create synergies between them.

Scope:With our cities being overly populated and dense, the scarcity of urban public space requires smart urban design, planning, management and prioritisation in urban space allocation to different uses, amenities, and services. From the reallocation of the urban public space to more sustainable forms of transport and energy generation and use, intermodal hubs, and interchanges to the dynamic management of the street profile and curb side, and the integration of suburban/peripheral areas in the general urban fabric and patterns, current and future research should aim to make urban public spaces more liveable while enabling better a connectivity, accessibility, social interaction, inclusion and transit in the context of a changing climate. Concepts like the '15-minute city” and 'superblocks” are gaining momentum and have an enormous potential in shaping the urban planning and design practice and the mobility services based on the principle of proximity. This is supporting the efficient and green mobility goals, the transport and energy policies, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy and the new EU Urban Mobility Framework.Considering the optimisation of urban public spaces, aspects related to air quality and urban climate must be considered by designing strategies based on new technologies and green infrastructures/green city zones.The proposal should address the question on how to deal with limited urban public space and conflicting demands for it between transport and other users, considering social and climate goals and the need to shift towards more energy efficient and sustainable modes of transport, decarbonisation of the heating and cooling infrastructures.Each proposal should envisage pilot demonstrations in at least three cities (lead cities) situated each in a different Member State or Associated Country including both urban and sub-urban areas. Proposals should provide the necessary evidence of the cities' commitment to test and implement the co-designed solutions. To foster replicability and up-taking of the outcomes, each proposal should also engage at least three replication/follower cities with the development of local replication plans. The size and characteristics of the cities should be considered. Each proposal should include at least one city of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities for the lead cities and one for the replication/follower cities.The pilots should involve a co-design process with the stakeholders concerned by the re-design of the urban space. The pilots should involve public and private local energy, mobility and industrial stakeholders as well as civil society to identify integrated, locally supported and space-saving solutions and related pre-conditions (incentives, participatory methods, etc.) in a change management process to gain public acceptance by information, participation and consideration of groups that were so far disadvantaged by existing conditions.Demonstrations should be 'digital by default' and use Local Digital Twins and, where possible, Mobility Data Spaces as tools for optimizing traffic, improving mobility services, monitoring environmental benefits in air and noise, and modelling a better use of urban space.Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project.Proposals should address the following two areas of intervention:1. Reallocation of space and re-design of infrastructureThis is a major game changer in cities in favour of more sustainable and efficient use of resources through integrated approaches that promote decarbonisation of different sectors notably sustainable modes of transport, buildings and industry and related services. By (re)designing and reallocating the urban public space to reflect the level of use of different transport modes, unsustainable transport, heating and cooling modes can be discouraged while sustainable ones incentivised. Smart urban public space design and management is also a key enabler for scaling-up new mobility services. First, it can help to develop more sustainable and accessible mobility services, with stations and hubs for shared devices and charging infrastructures, dedicated lanes for light and active modes, pick-up and drop-off zones, etc. Also, it can help to increase the acceptance of sustainable mobility services, by mitigating negative externalities caused by the inadequate use of urban space, such as illegal parking, and cluttering the sidewalks by e-scooters, advertising banners, traffic signals and others. The reallocation of space is also important to transform roads from mere transit spaces into public spaces with a higher socioeconomic value to people - a feature which has become extremely important for local recreation during the COVID-19 pandemic.The same applies to the planning and management of urban space to accommodate local clean and smart energy infrastructures to power the different uses of energy including mobility, buildings, commercial and industrial activities. One goal of the energy system integration would be to optimise the use of urban space and existing infrastructures to avoid unnecessary investments in distribution grids while increasing energy autonomy of the municipalities and reducing losses in transmission and distribution of energy. Moreover, planning and implementing simultaneously infrastructure projects can significantly reduce investment costs and space needs such as e.g. building an underground car park together with space for a geothermal heat pump or thermal heat storage.Four of the following research actions should be addressed to overcome these challenges either in the mobility (points 1 to 4) or energy area (points 5 to 8): Develop integrated transport and urban planning tools and methods to coordinate sustainable mobility services and the design of future public realms, accounting also for their interrelations and impacts across different spatial and temporal scales. This should be linked to the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) of the cities.For electromobility, foster research results from pilot projects on reallocation of use of transport infrastructure - or use of the single infrastructure for diverse types of vehicles, amenities (such as bi-directional charging points), and vehicles (e.g. after hours sharing of publicly accessible transport fleets) throughout the community of stakeholders at EU level.Research solutions for the exploitation of legacy infrastructure and how it can contribute to the scaling of sustainable mobility services followed by projects and demonstrations that can help to better understand this space shift, and play a significant role in the design, piloting and roll-out and assessment of these new mobility services.; Past experiences with street space reallocation (e.g. temporary infrastructures under COVID-19) can serve as a basis.Involvement of current service providers and infrastructure managers (e.g. parking service providers) in the urban space ecosystem to understand how current players can contribute to new mobility services, increased multimodality, electrification and integrated city logistics and citizens' mobility.With regards to energy, support pilot projects to increase understanding and exploitation of the potential of road space allocation and smart distributed energy generation and green city zones/infrastructures in a systemic manner and monitoring their positive effects on human well-being.Research opportunities for exploiting current infrastructures (e.g. buildings, grids, underground spaces) complemented by additional elements (e.g. access to data in real time, demand response, storage, smart charging, heat and energy storage) to facilitate local energy communities, virtual power plants and energy sharing while minimising the need for new infrastructures requiring space and facilitating multipurpose construction projects. This should also include the integration of thermal and electricity grids and storage to better manage and balance renewable electricity generation and demand.Establish an integrated approach for designing and decarbonising the heating and cooling networks (including distributed installations and small-scale networks and related storage) in cities and urban areas in synchronisation with planning of new housing, major renovations or industrial development related to major heat consuming or waste heat generating facilities.Explore ways of using/optimising green and blue infrastructures to city and street scale for improving urban climate, reduce the energy demand and in view of emission free transport. 2. Dynamic curb-side management and useSmart management of urban space and existing infrastructure includes their dynamic use, when considering curb space, changing its role and function in time, depending on parameters, functions and needs in relation to commuting peak hours, deliveries, public transport priority, market days, nightlife, etc. Dynamic space management is already being explored in some cities and represents an opportunity for further integration in mobility plans with the support of smart technologies, Intelligent Transport Systems, Local Digital Twins and Mobility Data Spaces, AI based autonomous optimal control and management systems.As the rise of new shared mobility services such as ride hailing, micromobility and the growth in urban goods delivery (even more so with the recent exponential growth of e-commerce) are challenging traditional ways of managing curb space, novel approaches are needed. Research on a shift away from curb use focused on street parking to a more flexible and dynamic allocation that for example includes pick-up and drop-off zones for passengers and freight or dedicated public transport lanes during peak hours, has also shown the potential to enhance and prioritise sustainable mobility services, and thus decrease the pressure on traffic thanks to an increased percentage of shared rides.To ensure the implementation of these innovative approaches, R&I could support by developing:Tools and guidelines to ensure the implementation of innovative approaches of dynamic space and curb use, resulting from tests and pilots of flexible allocation of curb side functions, including pick-up and drop-off zones for passengers and freight.New models of fee calculation (e.g. trip purpose, space demand (size) of each vehicle using the public domain, etc.) and financial model for the use of public space in cities in view of reaching public policy goals including climate neutrality. To increase impact and coherence, project(s) should maximise coordination with leading European associations and initiatives in this domain, e.g. Living-In.EU, the New European Bauhaus, Covenant of Mayors, the EIT KIC Culture and Creativity, the EIT Urban Mobility, the CIVITAS initiative, the 2Zero partnership and EU co-funded projects in the domain of Technologies for Smart Communities. Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential, and projects must ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work plan of the proposal. The collaboration with the Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date.","The Work Programme 2023-2024 of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in line with the provisions under the Implementation Plan of the Cities Mission, fosters the implementation of the Mission through actions that will continue to provide a strong and direct support to cities that will commit to climate neutrality and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution. In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission LabelClimate City Contracts (CCC) are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it - the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a Mission Label 'to the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC”. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: the Main Commitment Part which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; the Climate Neutral Action Plan which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.The Mission Platform will undertake a completeness check where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the co-creation process in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the consultation of the Mission Board and recommendation from the Mission Owners Group, the Mission Manager will decide whether to endorse the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work ProgrammeClimate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the European Green Deal to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the UN Agenda 2030, the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Fit for 55 strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change, the EU Industrial Strategy, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the New European Bauhaus initiative. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability. The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically, according to their specific focus to the following impacts:Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions;Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems, automation and connectivity;Increased deployment of solutions involving in particular urban greening, renaturing, reducing soil sealing, green/blue infrastructures, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches tackling both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects;Development and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District and improved knowledge on the necessary (replicable) elements and processes needed to make first a district and subsequently a whole city climate-neutral;Improved urban public space connectivity and accessibility of different urban districts and neighbourhoods by integrating multimodality and new (shared) services within the urban public space layout and infrastructure;Improved methods for assessing exposure to air, water, soil & noise pollution, particularly of vulnerable groups, informing health impact assessment focusing on the (co-)benefits and socio-economic impacts of zero pollution measures combined with climate neutrality policies;Better understanding and enhanced societal acceptance of sustainable mobility management schemes, including guidance and recommendations for national, regional and local authorities, EU institutions, public and private organisations;Improved sustainable development of peri-urban areas through the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures to achieve climate-neutrality;Increased preparedness and capacity of national, regional and local authorities in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe to engage in cities' transition towards climate neutrality;Increased capacity among European cities, with particular attention to those selected under the Cities Mission, to design and roll out their Climate City Contracts, including related investment plans and to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030.

They should include also thermal storage systems (seasonal STES, shorter term UTES etc) and thermal energy generation technologies (e.g. solar thermal, geothermal, etc.) for heating and cooling. Industry:Reduction of GHG emissions (CO2, methane from waste/wastewater, fluorinated gas, refrigerants) in industries located in peri-urban areas, supporting the 55% reduction goal for 2030;25% improved energy efficiency in industrial processes;30% increase in deployment of strategic net-zero technologies, such as solar (PV and thermal, wind, hydrogen, batteries and storage (incl. thermal energy storage), heat pumps and geothermal energy, electrolysers and fuel cells, biogas/biomethane, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and grid technologies, notably for energy-intensive industries located in peri-urban areas;Reinforce the green transition of industry, through Local Green Deals, i.e., mutual agreements between city authorities and local businesses and industry and citizens associations to support the territorial sustainability agenda in the peri-urban areas;25% enhanced recycling in industrial processes and materials reuse, including construction materials and demonstration and optimisation of recycling facilities for industries and processes located in peri-urban areas.

Scope:Peri-urban areas lie at the periphery of cities. They are the interface between rural and urban environments and are often the subject of high pressure from the urban core which results in an un-controlled and uneven urban expansion towards the rural territory often triggering environmental degradation. While dispersed and heterogenous in terms of land-occupancy, density and services and amenities distribution, the peri-urban territory integrates mutual inter-dependences within the urban-rural continuum. These can be associated with people (inwards and outwards migration or socio-demographic change) as well as with linkages and flows between a variety of rural and urban related functions and activities (ranging from industrial and recycling manufacturing, agriculture production and food processing, sanitation, waste disposal, drinking water provisions, to housing - including slums and gated communities - transport and associated infrastructure, large-scale commercial sites, and large recreational areas such as parks or forests), which juxtapose, collide and mesh in unintended and unplanned ways.Peri-urban areas are also the subject of weaker governance structures and limited institutional capacity, which in return limits the capacity to regulate economic activities and land-use and land coverage and makes it difficult to implement effective and integrated local, regional, and functional urban area wide policies and programs. This is particularly challenging in areas that straddle multiple jurisdictions, such as urban-rural fringe.This topic aims to foster the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within the current peri-urban development and planning practice to reduce these areas GHG emissions and to improve their liveability.Proposals, depending on chosen domains, should investigate a sustainable and decarbonised development of the peri-urban areas by shifting from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources in mobility, energy or industry domains supported by adequate governance structures and practices based on a sustainable land-use planning and an urban expansion which integrates environmental considerations and determinants. In addition, proposals should provide European demonstration-type examples on how to sustainably integrate climate-neutral, green, and smart solutions and measures into the peri-urban/urban development and the existing transport, energy, and industrial infrastructures, to achieve long-term decarbonization impacts and necessary climate resilience. Activities and pilot demonstrations of technological nature of the proposed solutions in operational environment are expected to be at minimum TRL 7 by the end of the project. Positive, long-term impacts on social cohesion, economic development, and public perception - resulting in behavioural change and policy change - should be fostered and anticipated. Proposals, depending on selected domains should:Explore particular characteristics of peri-urban areas that are distinct from rural and urban ones and analyse relevant urban-rural dynamics such as continuous and frequent land-use and functional changes, poor and inaccessible transport infrastructure, scattered and unevenly distributed day-to-day services and amenities.Explore models of urban/peri-urban development and planning containing the above-mentioned dynamics (e.g., expansion model, densification model, green-belts and green-corridors model) aimed at overcoming the sustainability, decarbonisation and local climate (e.g. heat islands) challenges of the urban-rural fringe while ensuring co-creation with and engagement of the relevant stakeholders (including citizens and communities).Focus on domains that are particularly pertinent in achieving progress in sustainable development, such as: Mobility and transport with extensive use of personal cars with combustion engines, poor and scattered infrastructure, and lack of sustainable transport options. Transport related emissions that are exacerbated by intensive commuter flows generated by peri-urban areas. City focused solutions that are not adapted to peri-urban areas and challenges often exceeding organizational, financial and knowledge capacities of local authorities. Proposals should analyse and explore how peri-urban generated traffic impacts the transport flows (for both goods and people) and its contribution to the total CO2/emissions of the entire urbanized territory.Industry, accounting for 30% of CO2 emissions and often located in peri-urban areas, is capital in succeeding the transition towards a net zero economy. Proposals should analyse the contribution to the total emissions reduction, of improved energy efficiency measures in industrial processes located in peri-urban areas, as well as of the deployment of strategic net-zero technologies, such as solar, (PV and thermal), wind, hydrogen, batteries and storage (incl. thermal energy storage), heat pumps and geothermal energy, electrolysers and fuel cells, biogas/biomethane, carbon capture and storage, and grid technologies, as envisaged in the EU Net Zero Industry Act. Proposals should ramp up and facilitate public-private partnerships, notably the key role of Local Green Deals (LGDs).Circular economy: Peri-urban areas are key for setting up recycling facilities for materials, products and equipment and scaling up material reuse, such as Social Urban Mining and recycling infrastructure across different industries (e.g., online marketplaces to empower exchange for materials, or physical Materials Banks for construction and demolition materials). Proposals should explore, analyse and facilitate the deployment of innovative industrial recycling processes, industrial symbiosis and closed-loop systems, as well as supporting knowledge transfer through innovative practices; piloting local platforms for Social Urban Mining[1]; demonstrating recycling and re-use processes for building and public works materials, industrial waste, water and waste management; enabling material reuse; inducing circular practices, reuse of materials and behavioural change.Vulnerability of peri-urban areas to environmental damage as most of the urban wastes (solid and liquid) and pollutant activities are pushed in the peripheries.Electricity grids and heating/cooling solutions are suboptimal in some peri-urban areas. The often-low energy efficiency and individual fossil fuel or even solid fuel-based heating of the building stock exacerbates energy poverty in the absence of sufficient population density for district heating while the lower real estate prices hamper deep renovation. The opportunities of available space for i.e., clean energy production or electricity and thermal storage are not sufficiently exploited to increase living comfort, accelerate energy transition for the benefit of the local economy and nearby urban areas.Governance, as peri-urban areas can be beyond the legal authority of cities, nor are they considered as part of the rural administrative units. Therefore, the capacity to regulate economic activities (and thus land-use and land coverage) is weak. This results in the peri-urbanization being largely an unplanned process, informal and sometime illegal and often resulting in environmental hazards and degradation of natural resources. This also results in a scattered and uneven distribution of services, amenities, and resources across the peri-urban area. The weaker governance structures complicate also integrated planning and green procurement of energy, transport, and other services.Social and cultural characteristics of peri-urban areas that are gaining on heterogeneity with continuous social dynamics. In many (Central and Eastern) EU cities the peri-urban expansion was driven by the emergence of a stronger middle class. However, in more recent years there has been an increasingly heterogenous mix of occupants/actors with multiple and most often conflicting interests, including settled populations, populations living in gated estates, in-migrants, transient workers, emerging middle-class among others. This overall leads to heterogeneous communities and, in general, to a lack of social cohesion. The research actions should cover the following:Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way, and provide a summary of measures contributing to climate neutrality in European peri-urban areas, identifying barriers.Establish co-designing process and engaging with the relevant stakeholders (such as: citizens, local authorities, mobility operators, service providers, energy companies, private businesses…) to ensure a successful uptake of solutions contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas.Develop, test, and demonstrate scalable solutions in real life in at least two out of the four domains (Mobility, Energy, Industry, Governance) contributing to climate neutrality of peri-urban areas. Each proposal should involve stakeholders from at least three 'lead urban/peri-urban areas', and at least three 'replicator' urban/peri-urban areas. Each urban/peri-urban area should establish a living laboratory where, under real life-conditions, a set of complementary and reinforcing solutions, centred on two to four aspects from the ones presented above (mobility, energy, industry, and governance) should be developed, tested, and implemented in an integrated approach. The participating urban/peri-urban areas, which may have a geographical coverage that goes as far as the full functional urban area, should demonstrate their common interests, and outline how they will ensure a meaningful and close cooperation. The peri-urban areas should each be situated in different EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe. Each proposal should at least include one urban area of the 112 selected ones for the EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities.To allow for a thorough evaluation of the projects' outcomes, proposals are expected to provide measurable indicators to demonstrate how the tested solutions are contributing to the climate neutrality objectives of the Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission and participating peri-urban areas. These should be supported by clear baselines, quantified targets, and appropriate review processes for each participating urban area. The baselines for the expected outcomes should take into account expected technological developments and policy implementation.Projects are expected to collaborate with the established and widely applied process and impact evaluation framework (using both clear baselines and measurable impact indicators) as well as the corporate design, the dissemination and information exchange frameworks put in place by the Commission (e.g. the Mission Platform, the CIVITAS initiative, Scalable cities, New European Bauhaus Community, the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, etc.) and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the EIT, such as, for example, EIT Urban Mobility, EIT Culture and Creativity or EIT Food, EU Mission Adaptation to Climate Change, and Driving Urban Transitions Partnership (DUT), depending on the area. They shall contribute to the development of the existing European knowledge base on the effectiveness and impacts resulting from the implementation of innovative, sustainable, green, and inclusive solutions in urban areas.Clear commitments and contributions to Europe-wide take-up during and beyond the project are expected, which could, for example, be in the form of follow-up actions funded by CEF, ELENA, or similar programmes.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines including ethics and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. Inclusiveness of vulnerable populations (older people, children) as well as gender perspectives should be considered. [1] Social Urban Mining - is the concept of creating extended value of demolished buildings by optimizing the deconstruction phase through re-use and high-value recycling. Social Urban Mining creates social added value by integrating social businesses in the operational activities.","The Work Programme 2023-2024 of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in line with the provisions under the Implementation Plan of the Cities Mission, fosters the implementation of the Mission through actions that will continue to provide a strong and direct support to cities that will commit to climate neutrality and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution. In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission LabelClimate City Contracts (CCC) are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it - the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a Mission Label 'to the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC”. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: the Main Commitment Part which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; the Climate Neutral Action Plan which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.The Mission Platform will undertake a completeness check where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the co-creation process in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the consultation of the Mission Board and recommendation from the Mission Owners Group, the Mission Manager will decide whether to endorse the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work ProgrammeClimate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the European Green Deal to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the UN Agenda 2030, the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Fit for 55 strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change, the EU Industrial Strategy, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the New European Bauhaus initiative. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability. The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&I projects.

Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically, according to their specific focus to the following impacts:Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions;Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems, automation and connectivity;Increased deployment of solutions involving in particular urban greening, renaturing, reducing soil sealing, green/blue infrastructures, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches tackling both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects;Development and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District and improved knowledge on the necessary (replicable) elements and processes needed to make first a district and subsequently a whole city climate-neutral;Improved urban public space connectivity and accessibility of different urban districts and neighbourhoods by integrating multimodality and new (shared) services within the urban public space layout and infrastructure;Improved methods for assessing exposure to air, water, soil & noise pollution, particularly of vulnerable groups, informing health impact assessment focusing on the (co-)benefits and socio-economic impacts of zero pollution measures combined with climate neutrality policies;Better understanding and enhanced societal acceptance of sustainable mobility management schemes, including guidance and recommendations for national, regional and local authorities, EU institutions, public and private organisations;Improved sustainable development of peri-urban areas through the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures to achieve climate-neutrality;Increased preparedness and capacity of national, regional and local authorities in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe to engage in cities' transition towards climate neutrality;Increased capacity among European cities, with particular attention to those selected under the Cities Mission, to design and roll out their Climate City Contracts, including related investment plans and to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030.

Scope:Cities are concerned by various types of pollution, including air, water, soil and noise pollution, and their negative impacts on human health and the environment. Many of these pollutants emanate from the same sources as greenhouse gas emissions being tackled in the context of the EU Mission Climate-Neutral Smart Cities, so it is clear there are potential environmental co-benefits from reducing GHG emissions.[2] Designing effective policies to protect city dwellers from pollution depends on solid evidence as well as on cooperation and communication between and with policy makers and citizens.Due to resource constraints, city administrations may often need to prioritise between different actions on different forms of pollution - and for this a solid risk-based evidence-base of the exposure to, impacts of and measures against pollution will allow to arrive at more informed and cost-effective local measures. These measures are often closely connected and affected by energy policy choices demonstrating the benefits of holistic approaches in for instance the planning, budgeting and assessment of costs and benefits in environmental, energy and climate policies at local level.More informed, coherent and targeted local measures will help European cities to deliver environmental co-benefits under the EU Mission for Climate-Neutral, Smart Cities, comply with or exceed EU legislative standards for air and water quality, and supporting the delivery of environmental objectives such as the targets of the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan and commitments under the Green City Accord.Applicants should propose projects that deliver better and innovative local measures against pollution through, among others, improved knowledge on the exposures of citizens to pollution and improved health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and/or noise pollution. Where technological solutions are proposed, these are expected to reach up to TRL 5 by the end of the project.In order to address these needs, individual projects must address at least two of the following areas:Improved health impact assessments to highlight and attempt to monetize the (co-)benefits and socio-economic impacts of zero pollution measures, in combination with climate neutrality policies, contributing to better ex-ante cost-benefit analysis and increasing public acceptance of measures.Measurement and modelling methods for more precisely assessing exposure and risk-based health impacts at regional and/or local level (should deliver results that can be communicated to the wider public as well).More precise evidence on exposure, notably of vulnerable population groups, and making health impact assessments easily comparable.Exploration of the effectiveness of dynamic abatement strategies by monitoring changes in pollution levels, complemented by citizen science / observations. All projects are required to:Develop methods and tools that can swiftly be deployed and used by cities and regional authorities. Once implemented they should help policy makers prioritise actions, and address social aspects of zero pollution policies,Support implementation of zero pollution policies by overcoming barriers to behavioural change which natural science and evidence alone cannot overcome. New approaches to address these barriers should be explored from the angles of behavioural economics, psychology, communication and organisational behaviour, with a view to inform effective local and regional zero pollution policies. Project(s) funded under this topic should involve at least two cities. Ideally at least one city in each project should be a city selected for the EU Mission Climate-Neutral Smart Cities and/or a city signatory to the EU Green City Accord (these can be the same city).To increase impact and coherence, project(s) should maximise coordination and complementarity with the 'Climate-Neutral Smart cities' Mission platform. Collaboration with the Cities Mission Platform is essential, and projects must ensure that appropriate provisions for activities and resources aimed at enforcing this collaboration are included in the work plan of the proposal. The collaboration with the Mission Platform must be formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded as soon as possible after the project starting date. Synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives, such as the European Green Capital / Leaf Awards, European Urban Initiative, the Covenant of Mayors Europe and the New European Bauhaus. Work performed or underway in other Horizon funded projects should also be considered, to the extent feasible, to avoid overlaps or contradictory conclusions. Cooperation with various stakeholders is recommended, for example, with health experts to professionally assess the impact of environmental influences on human health. [1]Taking account of known Exposure/Concentration Response Functions (ERF)[2]Important aspect is also climate urban stress and related extreme heat, which is covered in the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-04: Better understanding the local impacts of extreme heat.","The Work Programme 2023-2024 of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in line with the provisions under the Implementation Plan of the Cities Mission, fosters the implementation of the Mission through actions that will continue to provide a strong and direct support to cities that will commit to climate neutrality and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution. In turn, the cities benefitting from these actions will act as experimentation and innovation hubs for other cities to become climate-neutral by 2050.After the successful Call for Expression of Interest[[https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/climate-neutral-and-smart-cities_en#what-is-next]] and selection of Cities to join the Cities Mission, the first Climate City Contracts were submitted in the first semester of 2023. It is therefore now important for reasons of transparency to provide a summary overview of the main elements of the review process below. The review process and award of the Mission Label is without prejudice to the eligibility of cities and other entities to apply for calls under the Cities Mission Work Programme.Climate City Contracts review process and award of Mission LabelClimate City Contracts (CCC) are an innovative governance tool central to the EU Mission '100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030”. All cities that participate in the Cities Mission are to develop and implement a CCC with the help of the Mission Platform. CCCs are not legally binding but constitute a visible public commitment of those who sign it - the Mayor as a minimum, but ideally also all relevant local stakeholders as well as regional and national authorities and stakeholders. The European Commission will witness the signing of CCCs.As stated in the Implementation Plan, the Commission intends to award a Mission Label 'to the selected cities having signed a CCC, recognising the quality and feasibility of their commitments under the CCC”. The Mission Label is an acknowledgement of the successful completion of a process that was followed by the cities to develop their CCC. It should help facilitate access to EU, national and regional funding as well as to private investment but it does not guarantee automatic funding and financing from these investment programs.A procedure is being established for reviewing[[Details of the review procedure will be published at Climate-neutral and smart cities (europa.eu)]] the CCCs to allow the Mission Manager to endorse the CCC and award the Cities Mission Label. The review will cover the three parts of the Climate City Contracts, i.e.: the Main Commitment Part which describes the overall strategy and policy of the city to achieve climate neutrality in 2030; the Climate Neutral Action Plan which includes the setting of a baseline, 2030 gap analysis, impact pathways, agreed systemic solutions, portfolio of actions, timeline, KPIs and attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of the Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan which includes economic and financial capacity/capability needs, investment strategy, private and public capital required and key policy needs related to mobilising and deploying the required funding and financing for the implementation of the CCC.The Mission Platform will undertake a completeness check where a CCC will be considered complete and mature enough for submission to the Commission when the Mission Platform can confirm the completeness of the co-creation process in which all relevant stakeholders have been involved and agreed to the vision and related activities set out in the main commitments part of the CCC and the completeness of the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.After submission, the Mission Secretariat will review the Main Commitment part, experts from the Joint Research Centre will review the Climate Neutrality Action Plan and independent financial experts will review the Climate Neutrality Investment Plan.The reviews will then be transmitted to the Mission Board and to the Commission-internal Mission Owners Group. Following the consultation of the Mission Board and recommendation from the Mission Owners Group, the Mission Manager will decide whether to endorse the CCC and award the Mission Label. The Mission Platform will carry on working with cities to update their CCCs and will monitor their implementation.Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 2023-2024 Work ProgrammeClimate neutrality for cities is associated with important co-benefits and urban qualities such as reduced air and noise pollution, improved health and well-being, reduced urban environmental footprints, enhanced urban greening, reduced soil sealing and improved water management. It is also associated with policy coherence across sectors and with participatory and inclusive decision-making. Therefore, in addition to a significant contribution to the objective of the European Green Deal to make Europe climate-neutral by 2050, the actions funded will also contribute to the UN Agenda 2030, the EU Zero Pollution Action Plan, the Fit for 55 strategy, the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, the EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change, the EU Industrial Strategy, the EU Bioeconomy Strategy and the New European Bauhaus initiative. In the process, they will support cities in their twin green and digital transformation.Topics under the 2023-2024 calls will continue to work on developing and scaling up R&I activities and solutions while fostering synergies and joint actions with Horizon Europe Partnerships as well as other EU Missions. The envisaged actions will aim at:accelerating the transition of European cities to climate neutrality by exploiting the potential of electric, automated and connected as well as shared people mobility and freight transport through a joint action with the Horizon Europe Partnerships dedicated to Zero-emission Road Transport (2Zero) and Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility (CCAM);engaging cities in decisive climate mitigation and adaptation efforts to reduce emissions, based on innovative use of urban greening and nature-based solutions through a joint action with the Adaptation to Climate Change Mission;developing and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District (PED) covering modelling, management, citizen interaction, self-optimization, decision support/scenario analysis. rethinking urban spaces towards climate neutrality by developing and applying methods and tools for a smart urban public space design and physical infrastructure management;delivering better and innovative local measures against pollution through increased knowledge about the exposure of citizens to pollution and health impact assessments and strategies to reduce health impacts related to air, water, soil and noise pollution;exploring, analysing and evaluating the effectiveness of mobility management schemes, influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply, in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system;fostering the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures within peri-urban development and planning practices to reduce GHG emissions and to improve liveability. The operational capacity of the Mission Platform established through a Framework Partnership Agreement (HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-03) will be strengthened in order to: 1) ensure support to all the cities selected through the Call for Expression of Interest to be part of the Mission[[ https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/eu-cities-mission-meet-cities_en]], as well as to 2) provide support and basic services to all those cities that participated in the call and showed ambition and commitment to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030 but were not included in the final list of selected cities as well as cities responding to the second objective of the Mission.Enhanced support will be provided to national networks in Member States and Associated Countries to support cities in pursuing their climate neutrality ambition, by strengthening existing ones as well as encouraging and supporting the creation of such structures in countries where this has not yet taken place.Support for financial advisory services to be provided to help cities develop and eventually implement their investment strategy for becoming climate-neutral will also be addressed under this Work Programme.Proposals should demonstrate, as appropriate to their scope and size, how they internalise the principles of the Cities Mission, notably: (1) the contribution of the action to an overarching strategy aiming at climate neutrality for cities, (2) the place of the action within a holistic and cross-sectoral approach to climate neutrality, and (3) diversity in terms of geographical location and size of cities.Applicants are encouraged to show how their proposals take into account and build upon existing programmes and/or the results of previous R&I projects. While addressing the particular challenge of a topic and ensuring the doing no harm principles, proposals should also contribute as relevant to the following cross-cutting priorities: (1) zero pollution, (2) sustainable digitisation and green ICT, (3) interoperability and shared standards, and (4) affordability, social inclusiveness and accessibility.Strong synergies contributing to the implementation of the objectives of the Cities Mission is expected also from other relevant Horizon Europe partnerships such as e.g. the European Partnership for People-centric Sustainable Built Environment (Built4People) and on Driving Urban Transitions to a Sustainable Future (DUT). Topics under the Cities Mission Work Programme are also relevant for the Cancer Mission, in particular when addressing co-benefits generated by achieving climate-neutrality such as reduced pollution, improved health and wellbeing, increased active mobility contributing then to cancer prevention. Similarly, actions funded under the Cancer Mission focusing on behavioural change can contribute to the objectives of the Cities Mission especially when targeting actions at urban level.The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), with their experience in delivering holistic, transformative, citizen-driven and systemic solutions and innovations to specific global challenges, will also contribute to the Cities Mission in particular EIT Climate-KIC, EIT InnoEnergy and EIT Urban Mobility.In line with the General Conditions set out in the General Annexes to the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-2024 concerning eligibility under Innovation Actions, legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Horizon Europe Innovation Actions in any capacity.Proposals should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the main objectives of the Cities Mission, and more specifically, according to their specific focus to the following impacts:Enhanced innovation capacity of local/regional administrations and accelerated uptake of shared, smart and sustainable zero emission solutions;Increased use of transferrable solutions for sustainable mobility of people and goods exploiting the combined potential of zero-emission mobility systems, automation and connectivity;Increased deployment of solutions involving in particular urban greening, renaturing, reducing soil sealing, green/blue infrastructures, nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches tackling both climate mitigation and adaptation aspects;Development and testing a digital twin of a Positive clean Energy District and improved knowledge on the necessary (replicable) elements and processes needed to make first a district and subsequently a whole city climate-neutral;Improved urban public space connectivity and accessibility of different urban districts and neighbourhoods by integrating multimodality and new (shared) services within the urban public space layout and infrastructure;Improved methods for assessing exposure to air, water, soil & noise pollution, particularly of vulnerable groups, informing health impact assessment focusing on the (co-)benefits and socio-economic impacts of zero pollution measures combined with climate neutrality policies;Better understanding and enhanced societal acceptance of sustainable mobility management schemes, including guidance and recommendations for national, regional and local authorities, EU institutions, public and private organisations;Improved sustainable development of peri-urban areas through the integration of green and smart mobility, energy, industry and governance solutions and measures to achieve climate-neutrality;Increased preparedness and capacity of national, regional and local authorities in EU Member States and countries associated to Horizon Europe to engage in cities' transition towards climate neutrality;Increased capacity among European cities, with particular attention to those selected under the Cities Mission, to design and roll out their Climate City Contracts, including related investment plans and to achieve climate-neutrality by 2030.

Scope:The shift towards a decarbonised transport system is considered as challenging compared to other sectors of the economy. Achieving urban mobility decarbonisation can involve a variety of policy and technology measures and solutions. However, technological innovations alone are not sufficient for achieving a decarbonised urban transport system. They should be complemented by measures tapping into changes that target travel patterns and generate a shift in the daily mobility behaviour.Urban mobility management plans are developed by organisations in the public domain (by local and regional authorities) and the private domain (companies, organisations, and institutions) to promote sustainable urban transport as laid out in the Urban Mobility Framework[1] to reach climate neutrality, reduce congestion, air pollutant emissions, noise and other harmful effects of overreliance on fossil fuels-based transport.In the context of consultations for the preparation of the new Urban Mobility Framework, the support for mobility management plans has been voiced, with a majority of the respondents being in favour of adopting those plans by 'travel destination” such as organisers of big events, companies with more than 200 employees, universities, shopping centres/retail areas, primary and secondary schools as well as hospitals.It is not clear however how many mobility management schemes exist. When they exist, they seem not always fully taken up by their target users. In consequence, they do not lead to the desired behavioural change resulting in a shift towards sustainable mobility choices. Therefore, projects should identify and address specific bottlenecks and barriers that prevent the uptake of sustainable mobility management schemes across the EU and propose solutions that could lead to the desired behaviour change of citizens, aimed at more sustainable and decarbonised urban transport with all its related co-benefits in view of decarbonising the transport sector in line with the European Green Deal.A closely related challenge is the uptake of electromobility that requires an increase for clean electricity and the related infrastructure enhancement, notably distribution grids in cities. It is relevant to promote vehicle-to-grid solutions, to alleviate the needs to invest in distribution grid extension. In this regard, behavioural change is key to enable and incentivise electric vehicles users to participate in balancing the grid through smart and bidirectional charging.The objective of this topic is to explore, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of mobility management schemes (influencing behavioural change, travel demand and travel supply) in achieving a decarbonised and energy-efficient urban mobility system. To this end, projects should:Take stock of existing studies, analyse in a structured way and provide an overview of mobility managements schemes in the European urban area in both the public and the private domain, which seek to increase the use of sustainable transport modes infrastructure;Identify, analyse and assess leverages as well as barriers in the uptake of mobility management schemes for the most important target groups;Co-design with and engaging the organisations proposing the mobility schemes, identify and assess potential behaviour-related solutions to those barriers that ensure a successful uptake of mobility management systems. Those solutions should differentiate between specific target groups, in particular students, employees, customers and patients of relevant categories of organisations: schools, universities, hospitals and other health facilities, tourism and leisure sectors, shopping malls, private companies, living in European urban, peri-urban and rural areas. Identify user groups that are more motivated to change their behaviours and prepared to act as frontrunners, thus leading to a more rapid adoption;Propose recommendations that support and incentivise the uptake of sustainable mobility choices by organisations and users;Propose recommendations to support the uptake of smart and bidirectional recharging for electric vehicles and related demand side management schemes in cities to enable electric vehicles (EV) participation in electricity markets as active customers that can feed the electricity stored in EV batteries back to the power grid during the peak hours to help balance the growing the electricity demand (thus avoiding need for investments into grids);Establish incentives to promote renewable based e-mobility schemes notably smart and bidirectional charging in cities to reduce reliance on fossil fuels including via support and awareness raising schemes;Encourage new mobility behaviour by means of marketing, information and awareness raising campaigns. This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities. At least half of the four cities should be among the 112 cities selected for the EU Mission on Climate-neutral and Smart Cities[2]. [1]1_EN_ACT_part1_v7.docx (europa.eu)[2] The EU Mission on Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities aims to deliver 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030 and ensure that these cities act as experimentation and innovation hubs to enable all European cities to follow suit by 2050. On 28 April 2022, the Commission announced the 100 EU cities that will participate in the Mission. In addition, 12 cities have been selected from countries associated or expected to be associated the Horizon Europe programme.","The Work Programme 2023-2024 of the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, in line with the provisions under the Implementation Plan of the Cities Mission, fosters the implementation of the Mission through actions that will continue to provide a strong and direct support to cities that will commit to climate neutrality and enable them to roll out their climate action plans and achieve climate neutrality by 2030, in synergy with significant progress towards zero pollution.

If the project is on the second action 2) than the project results is expected to contribute at least two of the outcomes a), b) and d)Enhanced sustainability by addressing economic, social and environmental aspects (air pollution, waste management, health and safety, job opportunities, wildlife concerns, etc.) of offshore wind farms (a).Enhanced overall sustainability of large-scale production of offshore wind farms based on mainstreamed Life Cycle Analysis addressing social, economic and environmental aspects, as well as improved circularity of offshore wind turbines (b).Improved understanding on the negative and positive impacts of offshore wind farms throughout their lifetime (c).Innovative and cost-effective solutions for the construction and decommissioning of offshore wind farms aiming also the minimisation of the potential impacts to biodiversity and protected species and habitats (d). Scope:The aim is to develop and promote the use of modelling tools and objective holistic assessment metrics for realistic in-depth analysis of (cumulative) impacts of wind installations on the environment and on local communities and to integrate these in design tools for the deployment and decommissioning of offshore wind farms. It will be as well necessary to find innovative solutions to minimize the environmental impact during all stages of the life cycle of offshore wind farms but especially for the construction and decommissioning phase. An assessment framework for installations is needed with nature inclusive design options valuing 'created habitats' vs 'natural habitats'.The actions are expected to address one of the following actions:Action 1: develop design tools which can be used for the planning of offshore floating and fixed-bottom wind farms with the focus to minimize the overall life-cycle environmental impacts (noise, impact on seabed, visual effect, effects on marine life and other species) including floating turbines (e.g. the environmental impacts of fixing/anchoring techniques), reducing carbon footprint of the offshore wind plants across the life cycle, from construction to end of life and reduce the environmental impact in each consecutive step. The tool should make use of existing data of environmental impact studies and should be easy to customise considering different sea basin biodiversity characteristics and new available data. For that reason, a strong participation/commitment of industry players is required to ensure that inventory data from industry of the components is used in the analyses and validation of the tools. The action will deliver recommendations for implementable, simple and measurable criteria to assess at the tendering stage of future project, considering the sustainability and environmental (positive and negative) impacts of offshore wind farms. Action 2) develop innovative and cost-effective solutions (innovative processes, planning processes, supply chains, materials for construction, ….) for all phases of the life cycle of offshore wind farms but especially for the installation, construction and decommissioning phase of offshore wind farms with the aim to reduce the environmental impact as much as possible in these stages of the life cycle of offshore wind farms. In order to increase the integration of the design tools and the innovative solutions, it is important that consortia engage all different stakeholders like regulatory bodies, industry, governments and citizens.This R&I need is identified in the offshore renewable energy strategy (COM(2020) 741 final) that commits the Commission to 'carry out an analysis of costs and impacts of the decommissioning of offshore installations, with a view to assessing whether, both for the dismantling of the existing installations and for future decommissioning activities, EU-wide legal requirements are needed to minimise environmental, safety, economic impacts'. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.",,"This Destination includes activities targeting a sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply. In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral, in current and future climate conditions. R&I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO2 emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ 'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations; It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;Affordable and clean energy. The expected impact, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to 'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions”, notably through Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable renewable energy technologies and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply. This includes more efficient approaches to managing smart and cyber-secure energy grids and optimisation the interaction between producers, consumers, networks, infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).Accelerating the development of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO2 to products) (more detailed information below). Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity, renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the 'do not significantly harm” principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential, and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.Regarding the REPowerEU communication, renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels.

Under the European Green Deal, the Commission has also adopted a zero-pollution action plan, with a zero-pollution ambition, and a Biodiversity Strategy. In view of achieving these ambitious targets it is appropriate to further explore the development of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) as CO2 capture technologies in combination with CO2 storage, duly assessing their impacts on other environmental challenges.The project is expected to develop highly innovative CCUS /carbon negative technologies leading to CO2 removal.

The potential technologies require major technological breakthroughs.Projects should substantiate the potential for the proposed solutions in the area(s) of DACCS and/or BECCS as CO2 mitigation option by conducting an LCA in conformity with guidelines developed by the Commission, such as the Innovation Fund GHG methodology and the relevant ISO standards and the EU Taxonomy Regulation. This life cycle consideration should include the sustainability of biomass and the renewable origin of electricity but also assess other environmental dimensions (requirements for land, water; impacts on air and water quality, biodiversity; distances to major storage clusters, leakages etc.).Technology development has to be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) will be identified in the proposal and involved in deliberative activities to understand and address their concerns and needs. This will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society's readiness for the proposed solutions. Projects, therefore, could consider the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise in order to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities. Projects should also explore the socio-economic and political barriers to acceptability and awareness with a view to regulatory or policy initiatives and include aspects of circularity and best use of resources.Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).Proposals that include research into the use of direct air capture and BECCS for enhanced oil recovery will not be considered.

Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the 'do not significantly harm” principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems.

To this end, it is important to enhance its sustainability while creating wealth and additional employment opportunities in Europe.Consequently, project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:Reduce the environmental footprint associated to PV technology deployment across all the phases of the system lifetime (production, transport, installation and end of life). Define design and processing guidelines to optimally address circularity of PV systems for one or several PV technologies (silicon, thin film, organic PV, perovskite PV, etc.). Scope:In order to identify the main areas of improvement for the environmental footprint and resource efficiency of PV, it is necessary to regard the technology's entire lifecycle. Using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), important knowledge can be gained as to which processes and materials contribute most to the overall environmental footprint. The lifecycle-thinking also aids in identifying key candidates to reduce the use of resources from the design phase. Although it seems self-explanatory that reduction/substitution or efficient use of critical materials lead to improved environmental impact, it is of course essential that these do not adversely affect the function of the technology.For a renewable energy technology to be successful, it needs to have a strong net positive energy balance. This implies that the energy payback time of systems needs to be short, the carbon footprint needs to be reduced, the use of local materials to reduce transport costs in systems needs to be increased, the use of hazardous materials needs to be avoided, and systems and system components need to be designed in a way that encourages recycling and decreases material usage.Modern eco-friendly technologies and long lasting, repairable products are required in combination with sound circular economy approaches to process the huge stock of valuable resources at the end of life.International cooperation with the Mediterranean Region is encouraged.",,"This Destination includes activities targeting a sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply.

This includes more efficient approaches to managing smart and cyber-secure energy grids and optimisation the interaction between producers, consumers, networks, infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).Accelerating the development of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO2 to products) (more detailed information below). Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity, renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the 'do not significantly harm” principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems.

There are still some scientific and technological challenges to overcome to be able to exploit CO2 as a fuel feedstock, the main challenge being that the utilisation of CO2 is limited by the highly energy intensive conversion process.New solutions for the conversion of captured CO2 from different sources to fuels will create new markets for innovative industrial sectors and diversify the economic base in carbon-intensive regions, as well as contribute to achieving a Circular Economy. The project should evaluate the possibility for industrial CO2 use/reuse through the combination of processes (industrial symbiosis) and the efficient integration of CO2 capture and conversion to combine and/or reduce stages. Scope:Proposals will aim at the development of energy-efficient and economically and environmentally viable CO2 conversion technologies, including energy storage and/or displacement of fossil fuels that allow for upscaling in the short to medium term. Proposals have to define ambitious but achievable targets for energy requirements of the conversion process (including catalytic conversion), production costs and product yields that will be used to monitor project implementation. Proposals have to include the potential for the proposed CCU solution(s) as CO2 mitigation option through conducting an LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) in line with guidelines developed by the Commission, such as the Innovation Fund GHG methodology and the relevant ISO standards and the EU Taxonomy Regulation.Technology development has to be balanced by an assessment of the societal readiness towards the proposed innovations. Relevant end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations, and local associations) will be identified in the proposal, and involved in deliberative activities, so as understand and address their concerns and needs. This will be analysed during the project using appropriate techniques and methods from the social sciences and humanities, in order to create awareness, gain feedback on societal impact and advancing society's readiness for the proposed solutions. Projects, therefore, could consider the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise in order to enhance the societal impact of the related research activities. Projects should also explore the socio-economic and political barriers to acceptability and awareness with a view to regulatory or policy initiatives and include aspects of circularity and best use of resources. Proposals are expected to bring technologies that have reached at least TRL 4-5 to TRL 6-7 (please see part G of the General Annexes).Plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy, as outlined in the introduction to this Destination. The exploitation plans should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan, financial model) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).Projects are strongly encouraged to join the EU CCUS knowledge sharing project network.Projects should collaborate if appropriate with the Clean Hydrogen Joint Undertaking on aspects that require integration of hydrogen and are expected to contribute and participate to the activities of the TRUST database and the hydrogen observatory.This topic is complementary to the call CL4- Destination 1 Energy Intensive Industries on CCU.

In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral, in current and future climate conditions. R&I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO2 emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ 'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations; It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;Affordable and clean energy. The expected impact, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to 'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions”, notably through Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable renewable energy technologies and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply.

Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity, renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the 'do not significantly harm” principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential, and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.Regarding the REPowerEU communication, renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels.

Scope:The transition to a climate-neutral society requires that Europe's building stock also becomes climate-neutral. At the same time, Europe's building stock has to become climate resilient. This requires a comprehensive approach beyond individual buildings, namely at the level of neighbourhoods or urban districts. However, the decarbonisation of the built environment and its adaptation to a changing climate and to societal needs in terms of comfort, accessibility, inclusiveness, and aesthetics cannot happen without active participation of the buildings' users and occupants, individual / collective property owners, and energy communities as beneficiaries of the value chain. Professionals, such as project developers, architects, engineers, building owners, planners and statutory authorities, require solutions that develop, analyse, model, visualise and present a multitude and complex set of information in such a way that facilitates such co-design processes. This topic focuses on the development of digital solutions for a stronger participation of end users, citizens and other relevant stakeholders in the design, planning and management of the renovation of existing buildings, neighbourhoods and / or districts.Proposals are expected to address one or both of the following points:Digital solutions that facilitate participative design and planning through visualisation, analysis and engagement with data that is directly relevant to building users as well as citizens in the surrounding urban area (including e.g. immersive and interactive technologies, Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality, simulations and scenario modelling).Digital solutions that allow to analyse and model different scenarios for to-be-renovated buildings, neighbourhoods and / or districts in terms of energy use and generation; users' health and wellbeing; impact on the energy grid; provisions for active and electric mobility, and sustainable delivery solutions; life-cycle environmental and micro-climatic impacts, and; socio-economic impacts for citizens, building users, owners and occupiers. In addition, proposals are expected to address all of the following:Address aspects of climate-neutrality and climate-resilience, respecting the 'energy efficiency first' principle.Ensure the digital solution complements, builds on and/or uses existing tools (including, where relevant, on conventional, low-tech ones) and standards recognised by the market.Engage citizens (seeking coverage of different genders and social characteristics), end users of the tools and other relevant stakeholders involved in the design, planning and management of urban development projects in the development process of the digital solution.Ensure the digital solution offers different means to exchange information and provide input that are tailored to the specific needs of laypersons, including vulnerable, minority and disadvantaged groups as well as persons with disabilities and older persons.Demonstrate the prototype in at least three real-life urban development projects to apply, evaluate and refine the digital solution and inform its market launch and / or commercialisation strategy.Ensure the project's dissemination activities include actions that contribute to the activities of the NEB Community, and to sharing information, best practices and results within the NEB Lab.Contribute to the activities of the Built4People partners and to the Built4People network of innovation clusters.

In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral, in current and future climate conditions. R&I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications.

The expected impact, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to 'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions”, notably through Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable renewable energy technologies and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply. This includes more efficient approaches to managing smart and cyber-secure energy grids and optimisation the interaction between producers, consumers, networks, infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).Accelerating the development of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO2 to products) (more detailed information below). Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity, renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the 'do not significantly harm” principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems.

In line with the scope of cluster 5, this includes activities in the areas of renewable energy; energy system, grids and storage; as well as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).The transition of the energy system will rely on reducing the overall energy demand and making the energy supply side climate neutral, in current and future climate conditions. R&I actions will help to make the energy supply side cleaner, more secure, and competitive by boosting cost performance and reliability of a broad portfolio of renewable energy solutions, in line with societal needs and preferences. Furthermore, R&I activities will underpin the modernisation of the energy networks to support energy system integration, including the progressive electrification of demand side sectors (buildings, mobility, industry) and integration of other climate neutral, renewable energy carriers, such as clean hydrogen. Innovative energy storage solutions (including chemical, mechanical, electrical and thermal storage) are a key element of such energy system and R&I actions will advance their technological readiness for industrial-scale and domestic applications. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a CO2 emission abatement option that holds great potential and R&I actions will accelerate the development of CCUS in electricity generation and industry applications.This destination contributes to the activities of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) and its implementation working groups.This Destination contributes to the following Strategic Plan's Key Strategic Orientations (KSO):C: Making Europe the first digitally enabled circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems;A: Promoting an open strategic autonomy[[ 'Open strategic autonomy' refers to the term 'strategic autonomy while preserving an open economy', as reflected in the conclusions of the European Council 1 - 2 October 2020.]] by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations; It covers the following impact areas:Industrial leadership in key and emerging technologies that work for people;Affordable and clean energy. The expected impact, in line with the Strategic Plan, is to contribute to 'More efficient, clean, sustainable, secure and competitive energy supply through new solutions for smart grids and energy systems based on more performant renewable energy solutions”, notably through Fostering European global leadership in affordable, secure and sustainable renewable energy technologies and services by improving their competitiveness in global value chains and their position in growth markets, notably through the diversification of the renewable services and technology portfolio (more detailed information below).Ensuring cost-effective uninterrupted and affordable supply of energy to households and industries in a scenario of high penetration of variable renewables and other new low carbon energy supply. This includes more efficient approaches to managing smart and cyber-secure energy grids and optimisation the interaction between producers, consumers, networks, infrastructures and vectors (more detailed information below).Accelerating the development of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) as a CO2 emission mitigation option in electricity generation and industry applications (including also conversion of CO2 to products) (more detailed information below). Global leadership in renewable energyRenewable energy technologies encompass renewable electricity, renewable heating and cooling and renewable fuel technologies. They provide major opportunities to replace or substitute carbon from fossil origin in the power, heating/cooling, transportation, agriculture and industry economic sectors. Their large scale and decentralised deployment are expected to create more jobs than the fossil fuel equivalent and, especially, local jobs. Renewable energy technologies are the baseline on which to build a European and global climate-neutral future. A strong global European leadership in renewable energy technologies will pave the way to increase energy security and reliability.It is imperative to enhance affordability, security, sustainability, and efficiency for more established renewable energy technologies (such as wind energy, photovoltaics, solar thermal, bioenergy or hydropower), and to further diversify the technology portfolio. Furthermore, advanced renewable fuels, including synthetic fuels (which contain also direct solar fuels[[ Direct solar fuels are in this context renewable synthetic fuels made by direct conversion routes from solar to chemical energy]]) and sustainable advanced biofuels, are also needed to provide long-term carbon-neutral solutions for the transport, energy consuming and energy-intensive industrial sectors, in particular for applications where direct electrification is not a technically and cost-efficient option.In line with the 'do not significantly harm” principle for the environment, research and innovation actions for all renewable energy technologies aim to also improve the environmental sustainability of the technologies, delivering products with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved environmental performance regarding water use, circularity, pollution, and ecosystems. For biofuels and bioenergy improving the environmental sustainability is associated to the biomass conversion part of the value chain and the quality of the product, while air pollution associated to combustion in engines falls in the scope of other destinations in Cluster 5 and other environmental aspects will be under Cluster 6.Synergies with activities in cluster 4 are necessary for integrating renewable energy technologies and solutions in energy consuming industries and ensure that renewable energy solutions do not harm the environment. Complementarities with cluster 6 concern mainly biomass-related activities and with EIC low technology readiness level actions.All renewable energy technologies are addressed as they have all a strong international market potential, and it will be coherent with the EU policy of industrial leadership worldwide.Regarding the REPowerEU communication, renewable energy technologies are - as described above - a key instrument to diversify EU gas supplies and reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuels.

(17 topics)Renewable fuels, encompassing the most readily available technologies (advanced biofuels) but also the less mature ones (synthetic renewable fuels). Renewable fuels can be used in transport but also in buildings and industry to meet the demand for electricity and heat, therefore displacing fossil fuels. Gaseous renewable fuels are one of the named actions in the REPowerEU communication, as regards increasing the production of bio methane twice above the European Green Deal target in 2030. All forms of renewable fuels, and in particular advanced biofuels, contribute to reduce the EU's dependence, because they are drop-in fuels and direct replacements of fossil fuels, utilizing the existing infrastructure. (8 topics)The remainder of the topics also contributes to the objective of decreasing the EU's dependence on fossil fuels, with the focus either on specific renewable energy sectors (bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean energy and solar thermal) or on cross-technology activities (next generation renewable energy, market measures, international cooperation).

The exploitation plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund).Applicants can seek possibilities of involving the EC JRC. The JRC may provide characterisation, validation and certification of the performance of photovoltaic solar devices.

Scope:This topic aims at developing and implementing a set of innovative tools and methods on the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) for documenting, interlinking and organising data. Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:Creating, enriching and refining annotated bibliographiesDocumenting the results of fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological excavations or other collection processes and studies Creating, enriching and refining annotated bibliographiesA crucial task in both education and professional duties within cultural heritage is compiling bibliographies. This time-consuming activity entails gathering relevant literature on a cultural heritage object, entering bibliographic references in a list, assessing each document, and producing notes that are subsequently saved in the bibliography. This work has a value of its own, not only as part of the papers or reports created. Bibliographies therefore ought to be kept on the ECCCH, made accessible, and further enriched, refined and extended by collaborative and supervised efforts.For this use, projects funded under this topic should make sure that the ECCCH offers tools that automate much of the tedious tasks, and support cooperative work and re-use. Existing tools and bibliographic frameworks should be evaluated and when appropriate built upon. The tools to be developed should offer significant added value to its users beyond what is currently available, and should be developed based on the data model of the ECCCH, gathering data from and incorporating data in the ECCCH. These tools may, to the extent feasible, include functionality to parse and enrich data from for instance retrodigitised sources not readily machine readable. Given a topic or a specific heritage object and/or a small initial set of papers selected by the user, enhanced AI technologies working on text or/and on images should be able to retrieve related works, evaluate the fit of a given paper with the subject of the research, and produce a preliminary bibliography. The authoring system should support the creation, editing, and annotation of bibliographies. It should be possible to define with whom the results are shared (e.g. with a restricted group of professionals or with all users).Documenting the results of fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological excavations or other collection processes and studiesFieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological exploration and research typically produce large amounts of different kinds of data, such as survey documentation and documents presenting, narrating and interpreting the findings, photographic data, 3D models, drawings, maps and geographic information system data. At a later stage, most of the findings become assets for cultural heritage institutions such as museums. Such activities (excavation, study, etc.), thus, are a crucial phase of the musealisation process. Moreover, most countries enforce legal obligations regarding the archiving of data produced by excavations, as well as periodic reports.For this use, projects funded under this topic should offer a set of tools that makes the ECCCH a valuable resource for the community involved in such excavations and studies, using an extensible data model based on semantic technology, as well as a repository for the produced data, together with appropriate data visualisation and analysis instruments. Regulated reporting and archiving obligations in different countries should be analysed, and to the extent possible semi-automatised.Ontologies and vocabularies should be extended as needed to define the data structures and relationships between different data, in view of achieving interoperability. Repositories from different institutions and countries should be inter-operable and inter-connected. The semantic information layer should make it possible for AI technologies to access and ""learn"" from the archive. An extension to the ECCCH 3D browser should provide an interactive and visual interface to excavation data, and to the related findings.Also, citation capabilities should be integrated, to facilitate publication, sharing and reuse of data. Authoring tools should provide a way for the user to build ""narratives""[3] starting from the archival data.With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.In particular, in order to exploit potential synergies, proposals may consider, where appropriate, to build on the work of the projects funded under the topics HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-04 and HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-03, especially concerning Science Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) as flexible tools to monitor and track events of science linked to provenance, publishing, citation, data processing, data and software usage, as well as service consumption.[4]Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.

It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.R&I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.R&I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.R&I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity”, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.In line with the Commission priorities, R&I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[ The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[ Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage” (ECCCH).An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[ European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyvonen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[ See further https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[ In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: digital twins of heritage objects,digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role. The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives. The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[ ]] and the Open Source Initiative[[ https://opensource.org/licenses]].If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01' Expected impacts:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.

Scope:This topic aims at developing and implementing a set of innovative tools and methods on the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) for digitisation and analysis of dynamic processes, objects and complex combined data. Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:Digitising dynamic objects, processes and practicesMonitoring the evolving status of cultural heritage objects over timeInteracting with, cross-mixing and re-mixing different data types Digitisation of dynamic objects, processes and practicesThe main focus of 3D digitisation initiatives in the realm of cultural heritage has thus far been the shape and appearance of static objects. Practical techniques and technologies that enable accurate physical simulations of digitised items are mostly unexplored. Mechanical characteristics like stiffness, flexibility, mass distribution and strength, as well as mechanisms and moving parts are still largely undocumented. However, many heritage objects, including human-made devices, machines or practices, exhibit dynamic behaviours. Making adequate and precise digital models of such items and phenomena would enable more realistic simulations of, for instance, ancient artefacts like tissues, mechanisms, tools or practices, which would facilitate more insightful analysis and understanding.For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop new digitisation approaches enabling the correct capture of mechanical and dynamic characteristics of objects and practices.Monitoring the evolving status of cultural heritage objects over timeMonitoring the evolution over time of a heritage object is a key task in many cultural heritage contexts. This involves monitoring very slow phenomena (e.g. changes in the reflection attributes of a painted surface) as well as very rapid ones (for example fractures introduced by an abrupt event, such as damages to a loan artwork while traveling, or to a monument due to a seismic impact). The accurate sampling and detection of such changes occurring over time requires a number of new and integrated technologies: shape & colour sampling, use of networks of sensors displaced in a space, data integration, and software technologies able to make comparisons and to assess the changes. Innovative AI-based solutions may be developed to characterise and detect the changes, subject to the validation of human experts.For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop new digitisation approaches enabling an unprecedented capability to monitor the evolution over time of the status of heritage objects.Interacting with, cross-mixing and re-mixing different data typesMixing and integrating different media and media types in effective ways can expand insight capabilities, and lead to new knowledge generation. Projects funded under this topic should develop innovative tools and methods that give the ECCCH ground-breaking capabilities in this area.For this use, projects funded under this topic should explore how different media can be combined, using both the space and time axes, and how the creative processes involved can be supported. Such new methods will require studying new interaction modes, enabling the navigation over different media types and spaces (2D, 3D, text, …), and creating a common cross-media interaction language. Users should easily be able to use multiple media in a coordinated manner, for instance for the visual presentation and analysis of heritage objects (e.g. interconnecting 3D and text to tell the story of an artwork, intermixing the navigation of a 3D space and panoramic images to present both spatial and surface colour/reflection characteristics in an accurate manner, enabling the navigation of datasets which join 3D scanned external surfaces with computer tomography scanned data of the interior, or using 3D and images in the documentation of restoration). The tools and methods developed should allow the representation of non-static heritage, such as industrial heritage with many complex machines and processes. As an alternative to producing full digital models of complex machinery, which may be excessively expensive, different media may be combined to represent the dynamic essence of such assets with less effort, for instance using 3D models for the static characteristics of a machinery and adding video and sound to enhance the dynamic experience.The work produced may be implemented as new specific tools, and/or as extensions to the functional libraries included in the core ECCCH platform.With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should, when appropriate, be interoperable for sharing via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH. [1]'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.[2]'Dynamic objects, processes and practices' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all sorts of heritage where complex movements are important characteristics, and may include for instance complex assemblies, mechanisms, dance, etc.[3]'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.",,"Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[ CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)]]Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging.

This raises several issues that need to be considered in the design and use of the ECCCH, such as metadata models for different application domains, vocabularies and ontological structures, multilingualism, efficient interfaces for accessing and managing metadata and paradata, effective implementation and reuse of existing models for heterogeneous applications, as well as sustainable maintenance of metadata as the real world and its conceptualisations evolve over time.For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop and test innovative tools for human-driven acquisition, categorisation and annotation of digital objects (e.g. texts, images, 3D models, sounds or videos) combined with new AI-based approaches, resulting in high-quality content and metadata. Methods building on citizen science like approaches may also be considered. The tools should foster the emergence of new collaborative data curation scenarios within a multidisciplinary and multisectoral framework. They should further support innovative data interlinkage between cultural heritage objects and related actors, enabling a semi-automatic mutual enrichment process where data are completed and enhanced by detecting and integrating related sources of knowledge.Embedding scientific and professional value as well as IP and other associated rights throughout the digital content production chainWith the digital transformation of the cultural heritage area, large amounts of digital resources are emerging. However, a considerable part of this data remains inaccessible in private repositories.The ECCCH should support the transition from massive production of raw data related to activities on cultural heritage objects, to semantically rich and collectively produced digital resources (digital commons). In this context, a key to encourage data sharing is the adequate control of who may use the material created and/or curated, and of how it will be used.For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop innovative tools and methods to turn the massive digitisation effort into an opportunity to record and share not only the digital resources (with basic metadata), but also the methods and processes that led to their creation (such as human skills, technological and cognitive processes, or scientific protocols). The tools should support cultural heritage researchers and professionals to record the key steps of their activities on cultural heritage objects, ranging from the historical knowledge to the conservation, restoration and dissemination areas. The tools should produce data chains able to represent the complex workflows - often composed of combinations of individual skills and collective decisions - that constitute the creation of digital resources, as well as their progressive enrichment, transformation and re-use. This information should be linked to any data type/data element. The data chains should also embed information for managing ownership and property rights, use rights, and effective re-use of digital resources, in order to enable and encourage contribution to and use of shared repositories. These tools should, to the extent appropriate, be able to deal correctly with the different cases of unclear or contested IPR that may be encountered. The full production and enrichment chain of digital resources should be encoded, as an implicit mechanism to unveil the value chains of multi-actor collaborative productions. Block chains or other methods may be used, able to encode a stream of changes, modifications and re-uses of the digital objects.In order to encode this information, extensions to the ECCCH data model might be needed. If so, these extensions should be designed in cooperation with the ECCCH main consortium.Collaboration- and business models based on the multi-actor value chainSuch encoded value chains should enable innovative business models in collaboration with for instance cultural and creative industries. For this use, projects funded under this topic should introduce and experiment with collaboration- and business models for the data objects stored in the ECCCH, as well as the required web-based infrastructure to allow commercial collaborations. Such actions should be subject to the explicit authorisation of the owner institutions, and revenues shared with those institutions, based on the IPR information from the data value chains.Particularly in the context of sharing and re-use of digital cultural resources, the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as the European Open Science Cloud, might be valuable resources. Developments under these initiatives should be taken into account, as appropriate, in order to explore potential synergies and ensure complementarity.With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.Projects funded under this topic may, as appropriate, exploit and contribute to the European Open Science Cloud cross-domain interoperability framework and build on work by previous large-scale projects like PARTHENOS and SSHOC[3], as well as on data enrichment tools and activities in the context of the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. Furthermore, in order to exploit potential synergies, proposals should consider, when appropriate, to build on the work of the coordination project on the European Open Science Cloud Architecture and Interoperability Framework resulting from topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-05. [3]Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH. [1]'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.[2]'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.[3]This by no means imply that partners from such projects need to be part of the consortium.[4]This by no means imply that partners from such projects need to be part of the consortium.",,"Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[ CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)]]Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.R&I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.R&I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.R&I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity”, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.In line with the Commission priorities, R&I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[ The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[ Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage” (ECCCH).An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[ European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyvonen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[ See further https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[ In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: digital twins of heritage objects,digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role. The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives. The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[ ]] and the Open Source Initiative[[ https://opensource.org/licenses]].If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01' Expected impacts:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.

Scope:This topic aims at developing and implementing a set of innovative tools and methods on the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) for high-quality interactions with visitors and cultural heritage objects. Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:Creating, sharing and re-using interactive contentAnalysing, designing and testing interactions with visitors Creating, sharing and re-using interactive contentCultural heritage institutions regularly produce interactive content; for visitors to facilitate the comprehension of the exhibits on display, to entertain them or for research purposes. The platform used to deploy the content may be a simple interactive presentation device (e.g. a PC, a tablet or a mobile app) or more sophisticated immersive devices (large screens, VR rooms, head-mounted displays, specific interaction languages and related devices, etc.).The common practice in creating interactive content at cultural heritage institutions is single theme - single institution - no cooperation. This approach makes production costs high, often prohibitively high, since the content is designed from scratch and presented only to a limited audience.The challenge is to popularise and democratise the production and use of interactive content for cultural heritage. Innovation based on the ECCCH should make this possible.The tools and methods developed should include an easy-to-use authoring system, designed for a community of users which may not be able to master fully-fledged commercial authoring systems. Resources should be developed to facilitate the creation of content and the adoption of a cooperative approach that enables the reuse of components and previous productions. The tools developed should be capable of supporting the entire value chain, including for instance freelancers and small companies, educational institutions, non-profits, etc.The tools should support creation of multimedia content on top of basic components by using digital data in the ECCCH and as appropriate from other platforms, such as the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. Using existing components should reduce the digitisation costs of interactive media productions, since a considerable part of the required models and images will already be available.The tools should allow re-using portions of content contributed to the ECCCH by other partners. The ECCCH support for explicit tracking of data (re-)use will be key. Data on provenance and reuse of the digital assets should be acknowledged and maintained.The tools should also offer the capability to adapt the presentation to more sophisticated contexts, such as non-immersive systems mixing 3D models with high quality visual interfaces and metadata and videos, virtual reality settings providing a strong immersive experience, or virtual worlds/metaverse environments.Produced content should be deployable seamlessly on interactive kiosks in exhibition spaces and on web-based platforms, allowing to break the physical walls of the institution and widening the potential audience. Its metadata should allow the produced content to be shared also on other European platforms and data spaces.Analysing, designing and testing interactions with visitorsA common task in cultural heritage is to evaluate if the design of an exhibition - in a real or digital space - is functional and sufficiently impactful and meaningful for the audience. Common queries may include how people move around, which specific content they pay attention to, if they are able to appreciate the exhibits in a proper manner, which areas are most crowded, which points are of more or less interest, etc.Also, designing an exhibition is a complex task encompassing many activities related to the 3D space and visitors' perceptions, such as subdivisions of the exposition space, planning the visiting path, distribution of the exhibits and of didactic materials, lighting setup, etc.A 3D representation of the exposition space is a basic resource for both types of actions. While architectural CAD tools may in some cases provide support, these are often prohibitively complex and do not correspond well to the needs of the cultural heritage sector.For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods for designing and providing simulated and real data mapping over an exposition. Focus should be on the specific needs of cultural heritage professionals, and on the ease of use.The tools should be capable of generating preliminary assessments based on digital mock-ups, and assessments based on real physical spaces. Digital mock-ups of an exposition space could be navigated with interactive or virtual reality equipment, while specific equipment would be needed to gather data on users' navigation and interaction with a real physical space.The tools should also allow to design an exposition space, introducing separations, openings and pedestals etc. which allow creating a planned path, and smaller spaces inside larger physical exposition spaces, positioning the exhibits and setting a proper illumination.The tools should support collaborative work and sharing of resources and results through the ECCCH.With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.

[1]'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.[2]'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.",,"Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[ CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)]]Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.R&I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.R&I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.R&I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity”, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.In line with the Commission priorities, R&I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[ The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[ Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage” (ECCCH).An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[ European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyvonen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[ See further https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[ In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: digital twins of heritage objects,digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role. The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives. The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[ ]] and the Open Source Initiative[[ https://opensource.org/licenses]].If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01' Expected impacts:Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.

HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-05,"A European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage - Innovative tools for the study, conservation and restoration of heritage objects",HORIZON-IA HORIZON Innovation Actions,HORIZON Lump Sum Grant,single-stage,2024-06-18T00:00:00,2025-01-22T17:00:00,,3000000,4000000,2,46906427,46906387HORIZONInnovationActions1718668800000,"ExpectedOutcome:Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:The European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) is widely used by European cultural heritage professionals and researchers[1] for the study of cultural heritage objects[2], supporting research, innovation and didactic purposes.The ECCCH is widely used by European cultural heritage professionals and researchers to support conservation and restoration works, both for planning, implementation and documentation.European cultural heritage professionals and researchers are provided with clear information as well as targeted training modules on the innovative tools and methods developed. Scope:This topic aims at developing and implementing a set of innovative tools and methods on the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) based on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH, for the study, conservation and restoration of cultural heritage objects. Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:Supporting the study of cultural heritage objectsSupporting conservation and restoration works Supporting the study of cultural heritage objectsFor this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods which build on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH to allow cultural heritage professionals and researchers to structure, encode, store and analyse all knowledge needed for the study of a cultural heritage object such as artworks, prints, drawings, etc. Such combined use of multiple types of digital visual and other data available on the ECCCH could revolutionise current methodologies in research, documentation and didactics related to the study of cultural heritage objects. The tools would enable visualisation and measurement, support analysis and documentation of the reasoning process (e.g. via annotations or metadata), and build on highly accurate digital representations of the object (2D, 3D, 4D) stored in the ECCCH. The tools should allow to access, interlink, enhance, enrich and archive all necessary knowledge. Search-by-similarity queries should be possible over the ECCCH, based on innovative AI solutions.The focus is not only on documenting and archiving multiple heterogeneous documents, but also on identifying, storing and visualising connections among those assets. The digital twin of the cultural heritage object should be a spatial index for structuring and presenting all this knowledge. A cooperative approach should be enabled, with full control of who can access what.Supporting conservation and restoration worksIn the cultural heritage field, many different types of data are typically used to describe and monitor the condition of objects for conservation and restoration purposes, such as survey data, scientific imaging, reports, maps of degradation, photographic collections, historical archives, material sample analyses, etc. Many different professional disciplines are involved in data collection, processing and analysis (e.g. art history, architecture, conservation, materials science and engineering). Data collection, processing and analysis is an extremely complex task, performed both before and during restoration/conservation works.For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods to collect, manage and use data - with associated knowledge - for conservation and restoration purposes. These tools should build on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH and enable users to structure, encode, store, and analyse all resources needed for conservation assessment, restoration planning, and for documentation of restoration results, within a well-defined and dynamic collaborative framework.To cater to the needs of the wide range of professionals involved, the tools should address at least:Capture and management of information about material objects (including static and dynamic sensor networks), ensuring continuously updated digital twins in the ECCCH.Characterisation of the physical state of artefacts through analysis of material samples, scientific imaging, simulation of behaviours, etc.Efficient digital tools to assist users in analysis, diagnosis, and decision making.Evaluation and validation of documentation (including examination of diagnostic studies), to establish reproducible protocols for other (future) conservation and restoration efforts.Monitoring and archiving the conservation/restoration process over time with a long-term perspective, to prevent unnecessary degradation and plan for future restoration activities. AI based methods have the potential to play a key role in developing improved methods for solving research questions or gaining insights about data, such as categorisation, segmentation, recognition, analysis, and understanding. The goal should be to semi-automate work-intensive activities that are common in conservation and restoration.With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH. [1]'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.[2]'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.",,"Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[ CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)]]Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.R&I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.R&I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth.

If the analysis includes processing of personal data, it should consider including a risk assessment or privacy impact of individuals and society. Scope:Today's society is more interconnected than ever before. Telecommunication networks, transport networks, aviation, energy, water grids, finance are the backbone of today's society. Due to their exceptional complexity and size, infrastructure networks pose a specific challenge when it comes to identifying different risks, either cyber or physical. Especially in the cyber-domain, many intrusions or attacks remain unnoticed or are detected relatively late. Technological developments in areas like machine learning for analytics, user interfaces as well as storage applications have the potential to improve related capabilities.Modern urban environments and interconnected infrastructures create constantly big amounts of data. In addition, other sources can be exploited to support the identification and analysis of risks to infrastructures. Therefore, research on enhanced risk anticipation through real-time data analysis has the potential to lead to useful tools to enhance preparedness (contingency plans, scenario-based exercises, allocation of resources, etc.).Resilience of smart cities is marked by a set of specific requirements taking into account most notably aspects from the integration considering user centred approaches as well as social and ethical aspects of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), AI/ Machine Learning approaches for real-time data analytics, ensuring transparency, sufficient knowledge and their operational challenges in this area.While the availability of larger amounts of data from different sources offers potential to improve the identification of possible risks to infrastructures, it also increases the demand for fast and resilient analytical tools. There is a need to filter information to identify data that is relevant as an indicator for risks and - given the large number of different forms of cyber-attacks or intrusions - also a need to prioritise and decide according to the degree of danger they present. This implies the need for matching data in the appropriate context and verifying the source with a view of ensuring that only relevant data is analysed, thus avoiding false results. Faster identification and localisation of hazardous agents and contaminants inside the infrastructure networks is a key to allow for quick response, inform and involve citizens and residents as well as avoid large-scale damage of any incident. Such identification capabilities can be deployed as part of the infrastructure and integrate with the systems public authorities use to make sure information is available as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop methods for better cooperation between different actors to ensure a common understanding and interpretation of data and to provide interactive tools for exchange and visualisation for decision support. Cooperation between different public and private actors is essential in this regard.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.

In this view, proposals should as well indicate the perspectives for possible future demonstration, testing and validation at further TRLs.Research proposals should consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research, including but is not limited to research by other Framework Programmes' projects. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4-6 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.",,"This Destination addresses, among other, objectives identified by the Security Union Strategy[[COM(2020) 795 final.]] as well as the border management and security dimensions of the New Pact on Migration and Asylum[[COM(2020) 609 final.]] and the Strategy on the Schengen Area[[COM(2021) 277 final.]]. As such, topics included under the Destination aim at ensuring strong European land, air and sea external borders. This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&from=EN]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation funded under the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, the Community of European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) or with other security research and innovation working groups set-up by EU Agencies.Furthermore, successful proposals under this Destination should aim to be complementary and avoid overlaps with relevant actions funded by other EU instruments, including projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme as well as the European Defence Fund and its precursors (the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and the Preparatory Action on Defence research (PADR)) based on the information publicly available[[See for instance: - relevant work programmes of the EDF (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf_en) and of the DEP (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital) And information on ongoing projects of:- the EDF (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/edf) - the DEP (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital); Visit the following links for more information on past projects of the:- EDF (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-results;programCode=EDF)- EDIDP (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-industrial-development-programme-edidp_en)- PADR (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/preparatory-action-defence-research-padr_en).]] and while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.Proposals submitted under this Destination should demonstrate how they plan to build on relevant predecessor projects; to consider the citizens' and societal perspectives; to include education, training and awareness raising for practitioners and citizens; to measure the achieved TRL; and to prepare the uptake of the research outcomes.Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to make use primarily of Copernicus data, services and technologies.This Destination will develop knowledge and technologies that may be taken up by other instruments, such as the Integrated Border Management Fund, in its components of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) and Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI), that will enable exploitation of research results and final delivery of the required tools to security practitioners.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024:'Legitimate passengers and shipments travel more easily into the EU, while illicit trades, trafficking, piracy, terrorist and other criminal acts are prevented, due to improved air, land and sea border management and maritime security including better knowledge on social factors.”More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:Improved security (as well as better cost- and energy- efficient management) of EU land and air borders, as well as sea borders and maritime environment, infrastructures and activities, as well as for the EU external civilian security, against accidents, natural disasters and security challenges such as illegal trafficking, piracy and potential terrorist attacks, cyber and hybrid threats;Improved border crossing experience for travellers and border authorities staff (including customs, coast and border guards), while maintaining security and monitoring of movements across air, land and sea EU external borders, supporting the Schengen area, reducing illegal movements of people and goods across those borders and protecting fundamental rights of travellers, both EU citizens and Third Country Nationals;Improved customs and supply chain security though better prevention, detection, deterrence and fight of illegal activities involving flows of goods across EU external border crossing points and through the supply chain, as well as through better interoperability, minimising disruption to trade flows.

Scope:Authorities performing surveillance of maritime borders and maritime wide areas use a range of technologies, and receive a range of information, to monitor wide areas, detect threats or crises, and respond to them. However, these inputs are not always merged into common command-and-control (C2) systems that can inform rapid decision-making.The proposed solution(s) should allow improved interoperability (at both back-end and front-end levels), independently of the supplier of the equipment, and ideally interchangeability that enables exchange of information among authorities that use different systems. Compatibility and integration with other information sharing environments, including the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) is essential in order to support the cross-sectoral and cross-border exchange of information.The proposed solution(s) can include the design of open architecture C2 systems, including open standards for APIs and bias-free data models.The proposed solution(s) should enable simultaneous connection of different sensors (or of different data, or of different assets, depending by the module) by different suppliers, the flexible tasking and monitoring of surveillance assets like RPAS, and the visualization and manipulation of the data in a single user interface in a seamless way. This will support practitioners to exploit their technology stack in an agnostic way.The proposed solution(s) should allow for seamless connectivity between C2 systems from different authorities, and at different coordination levels; include cybersecurity measures and information access segregation capabilities; include concepts of operation, standard operating procedures and common lexicon for joint operations using interoperable systems through the proposed solution(s).While the project will mainly focus on enabling capabilities through interoperability and interchangeability, proposals that in the process aim at advancing certain technological components, and integrating them into the solution, are welcome.Assuming the project delivers on its goals, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research when compatible with applicable legislation using the financial support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).Improving energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of new security technologies for this capability (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): open architecture; user interface and experience; artificial intelligence; UxV; wide-area and long-endurance RPAS and integrated, wide-area RPAS cooperative tasking and management; remote sensors (such as LIDAR or FMCW) on UxVs; vessels-as-sensors; advanced mesh connectivity; automated analysis of abnormal or non-cooperative vessels' behaviour; Virtual and Augmented Reality; standardized mission data models for RPAS tasking and monitoring, ; and/or over-the-horizon detection technologies.Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes projects on security research. Proposals should also clearly demonstrate how they aim to complement and avoid overlaps with actions undertaken in the European Defence Fund and its precursors (the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and the Preparatory Action on Defence research (PADR)), based on the information publicly available[1] and while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available; and on the engagement with the Agency during the implementation of the project. This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should foresee that Frontex will observe projects' pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.Synergies within civil security can be an asset, for example with Disaster-Resilient Society and Fighting Crime and Terrorism.

HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-05,Cost-effective sustainable technologies and crisis management strategies for RN large-scale protection of population and infrastructures after a nuclear blast or nuclear facility incident,HORIZON-RIA HORIZON Research and Innovation Actions,HORIZON Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-27T00:00:00,2024-11-20T17:00:00,,6000000,6000000,1,45764693,45764207HORIZONResearchandInnovationActions1719446400000,"ExpectedOutcome:Projects' results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following outcomes:Based on existing national practices, improved understanding of the radioactive fallout and methodology regarding robust and rapid monitoring of dose rate and nuclide specific determination with purpose of facilitating safe evacuation after a nuclear or radiological event;Improved tools and methods for risk assessment following a nuclear or radiological event and optimized actions after a disaster that are based on risk analysis rather than probabilitiesIdentification of the relevant range of different protective measures, including medical countermeasures, needed after a RN disaster, and improved protection of population and infrastructures through better analysis of sensor data resulting in adequate protective actions;Improved understanding of contamination and decontamination of population and infrastructure, and improved rapid procedures for decontamination of individuals after a RN-incident;Recommendations on integration of improved technologies and assessment methodologies in the RN crisis managements systems. Scope:A nuclear explosion in any EU member country (or in the European neighbourhood) would lead to disastrous effects for numerous EU citizens and residents. For example, the initial effects from a nuclear explosion in a city will lead to, besides numerous dead and severely injured citizens, destroyed infrastructure. The radioactive plume containing particulate matter may damage ventilation systems and fallout will generate high dose rates. Criticality or other incidents at nuclear power plants and nuclear-powered vessels may occur because of direct attack, sabotage, collateral damage, accidents, loss of infrastructure services such as power and/or water supply or lack of necessary skilled personnel on site. Research on large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion need to be undertaken both separately as well as in a RN-perspective. Research activities aimed at updating EU's possibilities for large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion would benefit from being carried out in close cooperation with other EU-members. Research activities should also pertain to improved understanding of the radioactive fallout and assessment of dose rates to the population following a nuclear explosion in order to enable use of cost-effective sustainable technologies in protection of population and infrastructures.In a situation after a RN-incident the time consuming and laborious decontamination procedures for the population must be reduced to a minimum. Therefore, the possibility to identifying the need for decontamination, and above all to assess that there is no need for decontamination would be beneficial as well as the possibility to enter a shelter or other protected area in a safe way.Protective measures in the aftermath of a RN disaster may vary depending on situations. Such measures should be based on evaluated risks rather than probabilities. Starting with sensor- as well as other available data, measures could be optimized from a risk-cost point-of-view resulting in cost-effectiveness.Based on measurement data, appropriate protective actions could be decided upon. If a risk analysis results in a low risk, a lower level of mitigating measures might be needed resulting in lower costs. Then resources can be used in other areas where they are more needed, leading to an overall optimized protection.Protective actions should be based on risk modelling. Such modelling is based on available knowledge of different input quantities resulting in a probability distribution, from which the risk can be calculated applying a consequence function.New technologies should be compatible with RN crisis management systems, strategies for crisis communication and take into account relevant societal and human factors, such as vulnerable group and cultural and linguistic diversities. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.

Scope:European customs need improved capabilities that allow bettering and automatically detecting from traces; interpreting images from scanned cargo; interpreting data; tracking goods; and/or identifying anomalies that support the detection of threats, smuggling or illicit trade eliminating or minimizing disruption to the trade flow. The proposed system should hence advance and/or combine as much as possible the components of detection, tracking and risk-based anticipation.On detection, the proposed solution(s) could include trustworthy algorithms for recognition that minimise false positives and biases. Proposed research could include, for example, image (shape) recognition and interpretation, and/or a trace detection approachOn tracking, the research can propose and explore, for example, technologies for improved traceability of goods and items that could be illicitly trafficked using non-invasive markings.On risk-based anticipation, the proposed solution(s) can leverage automated image recognition and interpretation capability coupled with data analytics, such as using advance cargo information in order to anticipate and detect security risks prior to goods' arrival at the EU external borders.The research project can test one or more specific use cases, such as (non-exhaustive examples): art; cultural goods; waste and other environmentally risky material, including radioactive ones; valuables; and/or dangerous items either assembled or disassembled.Improving energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of new security technologies for this capability (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): scanning (vision), detectors/”sniffers” (traces), nanotechnology, blockchain/DLT, artificial intelligence.Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other recent EU Framework Programmes projects on security research.Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals. The results of the research should be taken up by EU customs authorities in the framework of the Customs Union 'acting as one”, with the support of the Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI).The involvement of Police Authorities[1] is encouraged, as well as synergies with relevant topics of the Fighting against Crime and Terrorism Destination. [1]In the context of this Destination, 'Police Authorities' means public authorities explicitly designated by national law, or other entities legally mandated by the competent national authority, for the prevention, detection and/or investigation of terrorist offences or other criminal offences, specifically excluding police academies, forensic institutes, training facilities as well as border and customs authorities.",,"This Destination addresses, among other, objectives identified by the Security Union Strategy[[COM(2020) 795 final.]] as well as the border management and security dimensions of the New Pact on Migration and Asylum[[COM(2020) 609 final.]] and the Strategy on the Schengen Area[[COM(2021) 277 final.]]. As such, topics included under the Destination aim at ensuring strong European land, air and sea external borders. This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&from=EN]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation funded under the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, the Community of European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) or with other security research and innovation working groups set-up by EU Agencies.Furthermore, successful proposals under this Destination should aim to be complementary and avoid overlaps with relevant actions funded by other EU instruments, including projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme as well as the European Defence Fund and its precursors (the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and the Preparatory Action on Defence research (PADR)) based on the information publicly available[[See for instance: - relevant work programmes of the EDF (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf_en) and of the DEP (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital) And information on ongoing projects of:- the EDF (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/edf) - the DEP (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital); Visit the following links for more information on past projects of the:- EDF (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-results;programCode=EDF)- EDIDP (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-industrial-development-programme-edidp_en)- PADR (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/preparatory-action-defence-research-padr_en).]] and while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.Proposals submitted under this Destination should demonstrate how they plan to build on relevant predecessor projects; to consider the citizens' and societal perspectives; to include education, training and awareness raising for practitioners and citizens; to measure the achieved TRL; and to prepare the uptake of the research outcomes.Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to make use primarily of Copernicus data, services and technologies.This Destination will develop knowledge and technologies that may be taken up by other instruments, such as the Integrated Border Management Fund, in its components of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) and Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI), that will enable exploitation of research results and final delivery of the required tools to security practitioners.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024:'Legitimate passengers and shipments travel more easily into the EU, while illicit trades, trafficking, piracy, terrorist and other criminal acts are prevented, due to improved air, land and sea border management and maritime security including better knowledge on social factors.”More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:Improved security (as well as better cost- and energy- efficient management) of EU land and air borders, as well as sea borders and maritime environment, infrastructures and activities, as well as for the EU external civilian security, against accidents, natural disasters and security challenges such as illegal trafficking, piracy and potential terrorist attacks, cyber and hybrid threats;Improved border crossing experience for travellers and border authorities staff (including customs, coast and border guards), while maintaining security and monitoring of movements across air, land and sea EU external borders, supporting the Schengen area, reducing illegal movements of people and goods across those borders and protecting fundamental rights of travellers, both EU citizens and Third Country Nationals;Improved customs and supply chain security though better prevention, detection, deterrence and fight of illegal activities involving flows of goods across EU external border crossing points and through the supply chain, as well as through better interoperability, minimising disruption to trade flows.

Scope:The advent of large-scale quantum computers will compromise much of modern cryptography, which is instrumental in ensuring cybersecurity and privacy of the digital transition. Any cryptographic primitive based on the integer factorization and/or the discrete logarithm problems will be vulnerable to large-scale quantum-powered attacks. The digital data/products/systems that derive their security ultimately from the abovementioned primitives will be compromised and must be upgraded - including their replacement when needed- to quantum-resistant cryptography. The massive scale of this foreseen upgrade shows that preparations are needed today in order to widely implement the relevant mitigations in the future. Many companies and governments cannot afford to have their protected communications/data decrypted in the future, even if that future still seems distant. There is a need to advance swiftly in the transition to quantum-resistant cryptography.Post-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms should be deployable in a dynamic manner in order to quickly react to new quantum computer developments.

Scope:Growth of international travel and mobility (which will likely return to, and increase to a level above, the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels), the scarcity of resources, and the need to ease border crossings while maintaining security of the Schengen area, make reliable risk assessments and border checks prioritisation important. Border practitioners in some Member States are assessing feasibility, reliability and acceptability of optimised border controls using risk-based management.The solution(s) proposed under this topic should allow easier and more flexible allocation and change of resources in border checks, for example to meet seasonal peaks. A possible use case is that of roll-on-roll-off ferries. That situation may generate long queues for border and security checks, while often being seasonal. A proposed solution should help perform border checks, as well improve the speed for detecting threats in vehicles, such as weapons and explosives, without people coming out of vehicles and without slowing down (dis)embarkment off or onto roll-on-roll-off ferries.In any case, the proposed solution(s) should consider both the travellers and the goods accompanying them.Higher leveraging of risk management in border crossing practices has the potential to also decrease and minimise the use of personal data and the risk for violating fundamental rights. The project should integrate strong ethical, legal and acceptability assessment to ensure that, on the other hand, the risks of bias (such as on ethnicity or gender) and discrimination of risk mitigation is minimised.Collaboration with international stakeholders in the field of transport and transport safety in the air, maritime and rail contexts is encouraged.Should the project deliver on its goal and be compatible with applicable legislation, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research with the support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).The proposed system should ensure secure data collection, access, encryption, and decision support processes. Full encryption at transit and rest should be ensured, while enabling fuzzy searches on all metrics of the documents' data.The system should include automated decision support systems that suggest the end-users which process and database/tool can be legally used using a certain technology.Solutions should be compatible or interoperable with legacy and current systems, and propose or allow an interoperability between systems in use by different Member States.Improving energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of new security technologies for this capability (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): risk assessment methods, data fusion, sensors, artificial intelligence.Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other recent EU Framework Programmes projects on security research.Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.Proposals under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex), including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available, and engage with the Agency during the implementation of the project.

Scope:The confluence of incidents in recent years has brought renewed concerns over our systemic resilience to external shocks arising from natural-technological (NaTech) disasters. This is particularly acute in the event of disruption in the transport, power, water supply and communication sectors in highly populated and industrialised areas, or when such events raise the likelihood of cascading effects with severe impacts on communities and the economy that are hard or impossible to predict. The main focus on NaTech risks lies on a thorough understanding of the vulnerability of industrial sites and critical infrastructure, and the potential impact natural hazards can have on such technological resources. This entails the identification of both physical (safety of building facilities and structures) and operational vulnerabilities, often addressing multi-hazard conditions. Innovative methods are required for analysing worst-case scenarios, and informing decision-makers about the crosscutting and shared responses to different crises given available resources.Research involving multiple fields of expertise, including spatial information (to be specified), is also required to improve hi-tech capacities for operational response systems to better cope with natural and/or technological disasters occurring in Europe (and in overseas territories) in an integrated manner. This will rely on a knowledge sharing among natural and technological risks communities to develop a holistic vision for an integrated operational crisis management of NaTech disasters.This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme.

Scope:Software is at the foundation of all digital technologies and, as such, at the core of IT infrastructures, services, and products. Current software development prioritises fast deployment over security, which results in vulnerabilities and unsecure applications. Security engineering, both at the software and hardware levels, must be integrated in their development. Whilst a great portion of the software and hardware used in the EU is developed outside the European Union, it should comply with the security requirements within the EU. The EU should be able to rely on software and hardware that can be verified and audited as to their security. In particular, the potential security implications of using open-source software and hardware, and security auditability in that context, should be further explored. Software is subject to continuous update, so the security posture cannot be assessed once and for all, hence methods and tooling to perform continuous assessments of security are needed. In addition, security and privacy regulations also evolve, having to be factored in compliance approaches.The identification and analysis of potential regulatory aspects and barriers for the developed technologies/solutions is encouraged, where relevant.",,"Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following impact of the Strategic Plan 2021-2024: ""Increased cybersecurity and a more secure online environment by developing and using effectively EU and Member States' capabilities in digital technologies supporting protection of data and networks aspiring to technological sovereignty in this field, while respecting privacy and other fundamental rights; this should contribute to secure services, processes and products, as well as to robust digital infrastructures capable to resist and counter cyber-attacks and hybrid threats"".More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:Strengthened EU cybersecurity capacities and European Union sovereignty in digital technologiesMore resilient digital infrastructures, systems and processesIncreased software, hardware and supply chain securitySecured disruptive technologiesSmart and quantifiable security assurance and certification shared across the EUReinforced awareness and a common cyber security management and culture.

This should be done under the premises of feed and food as a critical infrastructure and risks pertaining therein;In addition to raising awareness, proposals should develop possible preparedness, mitigation and response plans for national authorities and the private sector. Scope:Plant and animal health is of global importance for sustainable agriculture and competitive agriculture and forestry, as well as for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems[1]. Globally, between 10 and 28 percent of crop production is lost to pests and contamination of food and feed by mycotoxins can severely threaten the health of humans and livestock. The International Year of Plant Health (IYPH) 2020, established by the United Nations, raised public and political awareness of the importance of plant health and a recent study (IPPC, 2021) calls the attention of policy makers to the main effects of climate change on plant health, helping governments and the international community addressing plant health challenges. Also, the food chain, from harvest of agricultural products, throughout processing, distribution and until consumption can be challenged by several (hybrid) threats, which are increasingly taking non-conventional forms and possibly targeting the agriculture and food chain with severe consequences.The Word Health Organisation identified intentional agriculture attack with biological weapons and food contamination as one of the main global public health threats of the 21st century. The potential for terrorist attacks or other criminal actions against agri-food targets is increasingly recognised as a threat to international security. The population's health could be jeopardised by the manipulation of communicable diseases or the contamination of food, soil, air and drinking water by CBR agents. These risks have been studied and documented by a Network of excellence (Plant and Food Biosecurity) funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (PLANTFOODSEC).In 2017, the ENVI Committee (Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the EU Parliament) has defined food defence as 'the protection of food from intentional contamination or adulteration by biological, chemical, physical or radiological agents. It includes measures regarding prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery form intentional acts of food contamination”. The potential impact on human health of deliberate sabotage of agricultural crops, seed or food can be estimated by extrapolation from the many documented examples of unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease.Current EU capabilities to detect and respond to agro-terrorism and bio-criminal acts are dispersed across different national practitioners, normally handled by regional or national bodies and are very limited in terms of coordination. Different countries have different governmental authorities for agricultural and feed and food domains, different collaborative networks, different border controls, different inspection bodies and different regulatory references and reporting mechanisms as well as different investigative bodies in the case of suspected feed/food crime. The EU institutions have to start to consider the agri-food chain as a critical infrastructure which can suffer from attacks and which need to be protected. The most effective way to accomplish this goal is through international cooperation by a multi-sectorial approach combing different expertise, such as from law enforcement, the feed and food sector and health emergency services.The main challenge is to increase the resilience of European agricultural production, feed and food processing and distribution chain in case of sudden shocks. Agriculture and food chains will be included as an important dimension to be analysed in the context of protection of European critical entities[2] in case of emergencies. It is also crucial to address the interrelations between the food chain shocks and different types of critical entities with the objective of developing tools and methods to minimize cascading effects and allow rapid recovery of service performance levels after incidents. In the new context also the interaction with climate change, global trade and internet trade (spreading often plant material not controlled at all and of low quality) need to be taken into consideration. Artificial intelligence provides new tools for better coping with many of the most important challenges.In this context, research should address agri-food systems shocks, taking account of the increasing effects of climate change and global trade (and their interaction) on pest outbreaks and spread, feed/food commodity shocks, due to external challenges, feed/food supply chains interruption and organised agri-food terrorism attacks.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is also encouraged.Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic as well as with the successful proposal(s) under topic HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-02: Soil pollution processes - modelling and inclusion in advanced digital decision-support tools should be envisaged to avoid duplication, and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.

All to ease border crossing for travellers, while maintaining border security against illicit or irregular crossings and protecting fundamental rights. This topic aims at exploring and developing enhanced capabilities for securely managing digitalised travel documents used for travel across external borders.The proposed solution should be compatible with planned or possible future EU highly digitalised travel documents formats and travel facilitation systems, and with applicable ICAO current and upcoming schemes. The proposed solutions should be compatible or interoperable with relevant existing digitalised travel documents systems. The proposed solutions should also respect fundamental rights such as privacy and protection of personal data, apply privacy by design of the application and use privacy-enhancing technologies.The operational applicability focus should be on highly digitalised travel documents and 'digital identity management” used for travel across external borders. However, the research should include enhancing the security of breeder documents, which risk being 'weak links” when they are used to obtain genuine, secure travel documents.The proposed solution should include techniques (including those to increase the robustness against attempts to falsify biometric data) to allow sharing of results from the tools, and share as few data used by the tool as possible to return those results (in order to increase data protection and minimize data leak risks). Leakage or compromising of personal data should be avoided in the transfer of tools or of their results.The proposed solution should ensure secure data collection, access, encryption and decision support for those in relevant roles in the border management processes. Full encryption at transit and rest should be ensured, while enabling fuzzy searches on all metrics of the documents' data.The proposed solution should include an automated decision support system that helps the work of operators and suggests to end-users (such as border authorities' staff) which process and which database/tool can be legally used with, or by, a certain technology or database.The developed solutions need to comply with the Ethics Guidelines on Trustworthy AI (2019)[1].Should the project deliver on its goal and be compatible with applicable legislation, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research with the support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other Framework Programmes projects. In particular, proposals should build on achievements and findings of relevant recent EU-funded civil security research projects, including those funded under HORIZON-CL3-2022-BM-01-02: Enhanced security of, and combating the frauds on, identity management and identity and travel documents.Proposals should delineate concrete and clear plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment in operational contexts) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex) and of the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available; and on the engagement with the Agencies during the implementation of the project. This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should foresee that Frontex and of eu-LISA will observe projects' pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.Synergies across authorities and across communities (such as border management, customs, law enforcement communities) within the civil security sector will be an asset, for example with Fighting Crime and Terrorism (regarding combating crime involving identity fraud). [1]https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai",,"This Destination addresses, among other, objectives identified by the Security Union Strategy[[COM(2020) 795 final.]] as well as the border management and security dimensions of the New Pact on Migration and Asylum[[COM(2020) 609 final.]] and the Strategy on the Schengen Area[[COM(2021) 277 final.]]. As such, topics included under the Destination aim at ensuring strong European land, air and sea external borders. This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&from=EN]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research & Innovation funded under the Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme, the Community of European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) or with other security research and innovation working groups set-up by EU Agencies.Furthermore, successful proposals under this Destination should aim to be complementary and avoid overlaps with relevant actions funded by other EU instruments, including projects funded by the Digital Europe Programme as well as the European Defence Fund and its precursors (the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and the Preparatory Action on Defence research (PADR)) based on the information publicly available[[See for instance: - relevant work programmes of the EDF (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf_en) and of the DEP (https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital) And information on ongoing projects of:- the EDF (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/edf) - the DEP (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital); Visit the following links for more information on past projects of the:- EDF (https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-results;programCode=EDF)- EDIDP (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-industrial-development-programme-edidp_en)- PADR (https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/preparatory-action-defence-research-padr_en).]] and while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.Proposals submitted under this Destination should demonstrate how they plan to build on relevant predecessor projects; to consider the citizens' and societal perspectives; to include education, training and awareness raising for practitioners and citizens; to measure the achieved TRL; and to prepare the uptake of the research outcomes.Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to make use primarily of Copernicus data, services and technologies.This Destination will develop knowledge and technologies that may be taken up by other instruments, such as the Integrated Border Management Fund, in its components of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) and Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI), that will enable exploitation of research results and final delivery of the required tools to security practitioners.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024:'Legitimate passengers and shipments travel more easily into the EU, while illicit trades, trafficking, piracy, terrorist and other criminal acts are prevented, due to improved air, land and sea border management and maritime security including better knowledge on social factors.”More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:Improved security (as well as better cost- and energy- efficient management) of EU land and air borders, as well as sea borders and maritime environment, infrastructures and activities, as well as for the EU external civilian security, against accidents, natural disasters and security challenges such as illegal trafficking, piracy and potential terrorist attacks, cyber and hybrid threats;Improved border crossing experience for travellers and border authorities staff (including customs, coast and border guards), while maintaining security and monitoring of movements across air, land and sea EU external borders, supporting the Schengen area, reducing illegal movements of people and goods across those borders and protecting fundamental rights of travellers, both EU citizens and Third Country Nationals;Improved customs and supply chain security though better prevention, detection, deterrence and fight of illegal activities involving flows of goods across EU external border crossing points and through the supply chain, as well as through better interoperability, minimising disruption to trade flows. Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.",,,

Scope:Europe is confronted with increasingly intense and sometimes unexpected consequences of natural disasters ranging from floods and heavy rain events to droughts and large-scale forest fires even in hitherto not affected regions, as well as other geohazards such as volcanic eruptions and landslides. To respond to these emerging challenges an integrated transnational emergency management is needed efficiently linking systems available at the European level such as, for example, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, with national, regional or local systems. Furthermore, an evaluation of applied disaster risk reduction methods is required, in particular alert and impact forecasting systems, to identify potential for improvement and constant innovation.Knowledge transfer (cross-border and cross-sectoral) about natural hazards-related risks and emergency management is essential to increase the resilience of societies. A vital dialogue and exchange of good practice examples among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policymakers and local communities is needed. In particular, the level of awareness of EU citizens for local risks can be increased by new approaches to visualise risks, vulnerability and exposure through e.g. impact forecasting data and mapping including satellite data and information. Emergency management plays a crucial role in this regard, taking into account the ongoing urbanization and economic growth, which put a lot of pressure on areas such as floodplains and their ability to absorb and store water.Currently, there are no harmonised / standardised European methods for identifying vulnerability and exposure on the basis of which alert and impact forecasting systems are established, allowing this information to be used by civil protection authorities in a timely manner to improve disaster preparedness, communication to local authorities and population, evaluation logistics etc. Recent flash floods in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg in July 2021 have shown that this lack of protocols hampered the efficient implementation of early warning and preparedness actions prior to the disaster event.This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science. Under the EC-ESA Earth System Science Initiative both institutions aim at coordinating efforts to support complementary collaborative projects, funded on the EC side through Horizon Europe and on the ESA side through the ESA FutureEO programme. Proposals should include a work package, means and resources for coordination with complementary projects funded under the Science for Society element of the ESA FutureEO programme. The projects(s) should establish a close coordination and collaboration with the relevant ESA relevant actions and projects (https://eo4society.esa.int).In this context it is important to remind that standardisation should support operations and policymaking to supplement it but should by no means substitute it. While standardisation of technology may be more straightforward, the right balance does especially have to be sought for processes. The action should ensure close synergies with standardisation activities on European and international level.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research/innovation activities.In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is also encouraged.",,"Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to primarily make use of Copernicus data, services and technologies.Proposals are encouraged also to coordinate with ESA relevant activities, especially those undertaken under the Science for Society element of the FutureEO programme (https://eo4society.esa.int).

Scope:End-users and public procurers from several countries are invited to send proposals for launching a Pre-Commercial Procurement action for the acquisition of R&D services for the development of innovative civil security technology solutions.The proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous work programmes aimed at creating Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies [for example, topic HORIZON-CL3-2022-SSRI-01-03: Stronger grounds for pre-commercial procurement of innovative security technologies.]. The successful proposals could therefore give continuity to the works initiated by those CSA projects.The proposals are expected to provide clear evidence on a number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk the PCP action, including:That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives;That there is a consolidated group of end-users and procurers with common needs and requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take an informed decision on a future joint procurement of innovative solutions;That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in exploring further joint-uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of the project;That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and mapped to the needs, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed challenge;That the PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready in due time in order to launch the call for R&D services according to the PCP rules.That there is a commitment to pursue the exploitation of results beyond the end of the project through engagement with stakeholders and implementation of exploitation strategies towards future uptake. The open market consultations required prior to launching the PCP call for tenders must have taken place in at least three EU Member States. Market consultations conducted during the previous CSA projects can be used if this requirement is fulfilled, and if it is justified that: i) their purpose was enough to guarantee the viability of the procurement and; ii) that the state-of-the-art has not changed since they were conducted.In relation with the PCP tendering process, the applicants should clarify how they intend to guarantee that:The principles of the EU Directive for public procurement[1] and in particular with the provisions related to PCP will be duly respected;Conflict of interests will be avoided, including through the ineligibility of bids from technology providers who are also beneficiaries of the project or who have been beneficiaries of the previous CSA projects;The confidentiality of the intellectual property of potential bidders will be protected;The technology developments to be conducted in the PCP will be done in compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal data;In developing technology solutions, societal aspects (e.g. perception of security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) will be taken into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner;All participating public buyers commit to comply with EU data protection legislation in the development of innovative, advanced systems to support security and in particular the principles of data protection by design and by default;The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2021) 4320, will be duly taken into account, in particular those measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start-ups and innovative SMEs. Applicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes:A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input resulting from the previous CSA projects, and to define clear verification and validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be developed throughout the PCP phases.Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle;Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial potential of proposed research efforts.Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or proposals. This strategy should consider joint-cross border procurement schemes and exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds. The applicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains.In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-8 by the end of the project - see General Annex B. [1]Directive 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU",,"The EU-funded security research and innovation framework was launched with the Preparatory Action for Security Research[[COM(2004) 72.]]. Since then, the programme has contributed substantially to knowledge and value creation in the field of internal security and to the consolidation of an ecosystem better equipped to capitalise on research and innovation to support the EU security priorities.While the success of the programme has materialised in relevant scientific findings, maturation of promising technology areas, operational validation of innovative concepts or support to policy implementation, a key challenge remains in improving the uptake of innovation.The extent to which innovative technologies developed thanks to EU R&I investment are industrialised and commercialised by EU industry, and acquired and deployed by end-users, thus contributing to the development of security capabilities[[For the purpose of this work programme, the terms 'Capability” should be understood as ""the ability to pursue a particular policy priority or achieve a desired operational effect”. The term 'capability” is often interchanged with the term 'capacity”, but this should be avoided. 'Capacity” could refer to an amount or volume of which one organisation could have enough or not. On the other hand, 'capability” refers to an ability, an aptitude or a process that can be developed or improved in consonance with the ultimate objective of the organisation.]], could give a valuable measure of the impact achieved with the programme. However, as explained in the Commission staff working document on Enhancing security through research and innovation[[SWD(2021) 422.]], there are factors inherent to the EU security ecosystem (often attributed to the market) that hinder the full achievement of this impact. These include market fragmentation, cultural barriers, analytical weaknesses, programming weaknesses, ethical, legal and societal considerations or lack of synergies between funding instruments, among others.It is worth noting that such factors affect all the security domains addressed in Cluster 3; that there is not one predominant factor with sufficient leverage by itself to change the overall innovation uptake dynamics; and that they exhibit complex relationships among them which are difficult to disentangle. It should also be noted that the innovation uptake process starts before the R&I cycle is triggered, and it is not finalised with the successful termination of a research project. Therefore, the uptake challenge extends beyond the realm of R&I. However, from within R&I it is possible, if not to materialise the uptake in every case, at least to pave the way towards its materialisation.To that aim, there is a need to create a favourable environment that is designed with the main purpose of increasing the impact of security R&I, that is visible and recognisable to those interested in contributing to this aim, and which provides bespoke tools that serve to tackle the factors that hinder innovation uptake.The SSRI Destination has therefore been designed with this purpose to serve equally to all the expected impacts of Cluster 3. Research applied in this domain will contribute to increasing the impact of the work carried out in the EU security Research and Innovation ecosystem as a whole and to contribute to its core values, namely: i) Ensuring that security R&I maintains the focus on the potential final use of its outcomes; ii) Contributing to a forward-looking planning of EU security capabilities; iii) Ensuring the development of security technologies that are socially acceptable; iv) Paving the way to the industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and deployment of successful R&I outcomes; and v) Safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.While the other Destinations of this Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme offer research and innovation activities to develop solutions to address specific security threats or capability needs, the SSRI Destination will trigger actions that will help bringing these and other developments closer to the market, thus contributing to the measures facilitating the uptake of innovation described in the Commission staff working document on security research. Those actions will help developers (including industry, research organisations and academia) to accelerate product development and improve the valorisation of their research investment. They will also support buyers and users in materialising the uptake of innovation and further develop their security capabilities.In addition, the SSRI Destination will offer an open environment to create knowledge and value through research in matters (including technology, but also social sciences and humanities) that are not exclusive of only one security area, but cross-cutting to the whole Cluster. This will contribute to reducing thematic fragmentation, bringing closer together the actors from different security domains, and expanding the market beyond traditional thematic silos.Finally, SSRI will allow the allocation of resources to the development of tools and methods to reinforce the innovation cycle itself from a process standpoint, thus increasing its effectiveness, efficiency and impact. This Destination will contribute to the development of the tailored analytical capacity required for the adoption of capability-driven approaches, in line with the provisions of the Action Plan on synergies between civil, defence and aerospace industries[[COM(2021) 70.]] and with the measures set out in the Commission staff working document on security research aimed at fostering a forward-looking capability-driven approach in security.In order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following impacts:A more effective and efficient evidence and knowledge-based development of EU civil security capabilities built on a stronger, more systematic and analysis-intensive security research and innovation cycle;Increased cooperation between demand and supply market actors, including with actors from other domains, fosters swift industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of successful outcomes of security research and reinforces the competitiveness and resilience of EU security technology and industrial base and safeguards the security of supply of EU-products in critical security areas;R&I-enabled knowledge and value in cross-cutting matters reduces sector specific bias and breaks thematic silos that impede the proliferation of common security solutions. Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.",,,

Scope:Europe's 25 million small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the EU economy. SMEs can bring innovation to societal challenges, including the security of EU citizens. Innovative SMEs and high-tech start-ups can transform and modernise EU security capabilities.However, despite the innovation capacity of EU SMEs, these often experience difficulties in finding their way to the public markets. These include red tape in public contracts, access to new customers, access to finance, industrial competition and IP valorisation. These difficulties are exacerbated in markets that show restrictions of different kind, as it is the case of security.Knowing that SMEs require additional support to reach the security buyers and that the collaboration opportunities offered by the projects of the Pillar II of Horizon Europe can be a catalyst for uptake, this topic aims to offer a collaborative environment for small and medium innovators to tailor their innovations to the specific needs of civil security end-users.Applicants are invited to submit proposals for technology development along with the following principles:Focus on mature technological solutions addressing EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme.Not overlapping with the scope of the topics included in the other destinations of this work programme.Fostering collaboration between SMEs from different Member States and Associated Countries.Involving security end-users in the role of validator and potential first-adopter of the proposed innovations.Fostering collaboration schemes between small companies and research and technology organisations and/or big industrial players aimed at fostering innovative technology transfer or creating innovative business models that facilitate access to market and strengthen the innovation capacity of EU SMEs and start-ups in the domain of civil security. Examples of activities to plan in the proposed projects include, but are not limited to: assimilating market requirements; facilitating access to additional funding; approaching potential public buyers; assess competitive landscape; supporting in innovation management (methodological and process innovation, business model innovation, market innovation); assist in IP management and exploitation; provide guidance for expansion to future markets, etc.The participation of research and technology organisations should not focus on own technology development but on supporting the small industrial players in accelerating the technology transfer of innovative security solutions for their further development and production.It is encouraged that one SME takes the coordinator role[1]. Exceptions to this requirement should be duly justified.The projects should have a maximum estimated duration of 2 years.Under this topic, projects should address the one of the following areas of Fighting Crime and Terrorism (FCT, Option A), Disaster-Resilient Society (DRS, Option B), Resilient Infrastructure (INFRA, Option C) Border Management (BM, Option D). Some examples of domains that could be addressed:.Option A: Some examples of domains that could be addressed under the FCT area are: (indicative and non-exhaustive): mobile forensics; deepfake detection; detection of counterfeiting (fake items, fake currency bills) or of falsified/forged documents (passports, ID cards); detection and countering of advanced forms of malware, as well as non-cash payment frauds and other cyber-scams.Option B: Some examples of domains that could be addressed under the DRS area are (indicative and non-exhaustive): data and satellite/remote sensing information exploitation, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance for disaster prevention.Option C: some examples of domains that could be addressed under the INFRA area are: (indicative and non-exhaustive): physical access control, autonomous systems used for infrastructure protection, positioning and localisation tracking and tracing, monitoring and surveillance of environments and activities.Option D: under the BM area are (indicative and non-exhaustive): facilitated border checks; secure documents and identity management for border crossings; border surveillance; detection of drugs, explosives, Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN), weapons and/or other dangerous materials in customs environment; detection of stolen, smuggled, illicit or illegal goods (cigarettes, art, cultural goods, wildlife) in a customs environmentIn this topic, projects should address the EU security policy priorities in the areas addressed by the Cluster 3 work programme.In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-7 by the end of the project - see General Annex B. [1]If a MIDCAP is included in the proposal, it could also take the role of coordinator.",,"The EU-funded security research and innovation framework was launched with the Preparatory Action for Security Research[[COM(2004) 72.]]. Since then, the programme has contributed substantially to knowledge and value creation in the field of internal security and to the consolidation of an ecosystem better equipped to capitalise on research and innovation to support the EU security priorities.While the success of the programme has materialised in relevant scientific findings, maturation of promising technology areas, operational validation of innovative concepts or support to policy implementation, a key challenge remains in improving the uptake of innovation.The extent to which innovative technologies developed thanks to EU R&I investment are industrialised and commercialised by EU industry, and acquired and deployed by end-users, thus contributing to the development of security capabilities[[For the purpose of this work programme, the terms 'Capability” should be understood as ""the ability to pursue a particular policy priority or achieve a desired operational effect”. The term 'capability” is often interchanged with the term 'capacity”, but this should be avoided. 'Capacity” could refer to an amount or volume of which one organisation could have enough or not. On the other hand, 'capability” refers to an ability, an aptitude or a process that can be developed or improved in consonance with the ultimate objective of the organisation.]], could give a valuable measure of the impact achieved with the programme. However, as explained in the Commission staff working document on Enhancing security through research and innovation[[SWD(2021) 422.]], there are factors inherent to the EU security ecosystem (often attributed to the market) that hinder the full achievement of this impact. These include market fragmentation, cultural barriers, analytical weaknesses, programming weaknesses, ethical, legal and societal considerations or lack of synergies between funding instruments, among others.It is worth noting that such factors affect all the security domains addressed in Cluster 3; that there is not one predominant factor with sufficient leverage by itself to change the overall innovation uptake dynamics; and that they exhibit complex relationships among them which are difficult to disentangle. It should also be noted that the innovation uptake process starts before the R&I cycle is triggered, and it is not finalised with the successful termination of a research project. Therefore, the uptake challenge extends beyond the realm of R&I. However, from within R&I it is possible, if not to materialise the uptake in every case, at least to pave the way towards its materialisation.To that aim, there is a need to create a favourable environment that is designed with the main purpose of increasing the impact of security R&I, that is visible and recognisable to those interested in contributing to this aim, and which provides bespoke tools that serve to tackle the factors that hinder innovation uptake.The SSRI Destination has therefore been designed with this purpose to serve equally to all the expected impacts of Cluster 3.

Scope:European territories are developing into more connected and complex systems of different services and infrastructures empowered by technologies and growing digitisation. This change in urban areas in Europe, brings new opportunities but also new threats for the authorities and their relationship with the citizens and residents. It is therefore critical for the resilience of our urban areas and for their citizens' wellbeing that those services are trusted and secure.The classical large-scale infrastructures have a long tradition of implementing the principles of Safety-by-design and Security-by-design when planning their assets. However, with more and more infrastructures on the local level becoming vulnerable, security research can support their protection with new approaches in 'Security-by-design'[1]. In view of limited budgets of many local administrations, improved knowledge as well as innovative security upgrades and processes for existing urban infrastructures equipped with advanced connectivity technologies and cooperative systems could be explored.EU territories, despite their size and location, suffer from a lack of dedicated EU sovereign and trusted tools in order to enhance the coordination of local first responders and to improve security coverage, such as the preparation of operational staff, field intervention and predictive tools. Even though some complicated tools already exist, it is clear that there is no generic, cost effective and easy to use solutions for local authorities. Therefore, there is a need for creation of new tools that are designed in a simple manner and deployed in an effective way.Resilient and secure urban planning tools for the development of holistic approaches that network the different organizational levels, sensor and communication levels and data rooms are very pertinent. These tools should assess the resilience of urban and peri urban territories, identify weaknesses and recommend changes to organizational processes, sensors and communication infrastructure. The secure urban and rural living spaces, technical solutions, organizational levels, and data rooms must be more closely linked. There is a clear need for a development of tools for recovery strategies and proactive foresight for urban and peri urban environments. The tactical tools should include modelling of urban centres and rural areas, predictive tools, improved global situational awareness and day-to-day planning and crisis management (e.g., simulation, training).The proposals should include a high level of confidence in data management and sharing, provide solutions on cybersecurity issues and take on board new type of threats. The proposed solutions should suggest trusted shared architectures, trusted data collection, secure computation on the data and management processes, modelling capabilities, hypervisor supporting global situational awareness with open and trusted API's, trusted data processing engines and, e.g., artificial intelligence tools. If the tools include processing of personal data, it should consider including a risk assessment or privacy impact of individuals and society.The testing and/or piloting of the tools and solutions developed in a real setting and the participation of one or more relevant local authorities is an asset; regardless, actions should foresee how they will facilitate the uptake, replication across setting and up-scaling of the capabilities - i.e. solutions, tools, processes et al. - to be developed by the project.This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.

Scope:The use of online undercover investigation techniques is an important asset for Police Authorities in infiltrating the networks of sexual abusers of children. These methods have proven very effective in understanding offender behaviour and interaction of online service providers, and have ultimately facilitated the shutting down of communication channels used by these offenders, as well as their prosecution. An increasingly important need for Police Authorities' activity in these spaces is the ability to effectively infiltrate particularly dangerous online groups of offenders, while making sure that the evidence obtained will be admissible in court. EU values and fundamental rights shall stay in the core of any future measures. Research in this area should tackle legislative frameworks to collecting evidence in online, including undercover, investigations of child sexual abuse, leading to guidelines and manuals that would make the capability available across the EU to target these offenders more effectively. The results of this research topic (training, manuals guidelines) should be shared among all European Police Authorities, notably via CEPOL, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding under this topic. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as create synergies with similar on-going security research projects from the Calls 2021-2022 on Fighting Crime and Terrorism in the area of digital forensics and countering child sexual abuse, in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.Since the use of undercover agents online could be beneficial in other crime areas too, particularly in counter terrorism, analysis of possibilities for the developed approaches to be adapted to these other crime areas would be welcome. Special care needs to be given to ethics and fundamental rights protection throughout the research and the solutions proposed. This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.",,"Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024: 'Crime and terrorism are more effectively tackled, while respecting fundamental rights, […] thanks to more powerful prevention, preparedness and response, a better understanding of related human, societal and technological aspects, and the development of cutting-edge capabilities for police authorities […] including measures against cybercrime.”More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:Modern information analysis for Police Authorities, allowing them to efficiently fight criminals and terrorists who use novel technologies;Improved forensics and lawful evidence collection, increasing the capabilities to apprehend criminals and terrorists and bring them to the court;Enhanced prevention, detection and deterrence of societal issues related to various forms of crime, including cybercrime, and terrorism, such as violent radicalisation, domestic and sexual violence, or juvenile offenders;Increased security of citizens against terrorism, including in public spaces (while preserving their quality and openness);Improved intelligence picture and enhanced prevention, detection and deterrence of various forms of organised crime;More secure cyberspace for citizens, especially children, through a robust prevention, detection, and protection from cybercriminal activities.

Scope:Terrorism resulting from radicalisation and violent extremism is a serious threat to European security. Part of the complexity of these phenomena lies in the fact that there is neither a single pathway to radicalisation nor a single terrorist profile. Support of extremists is an effect of individual clusters of psychological, personal, social, economic and political reasons. From a gender perspective, women's radicalisation and involvement in violent extremist groups remain relatively under-researched, poorly understood and possibly characterized by misconceptions about women's exclusion from decision-making processes, as well as their significant underrepresentation in bodies countering the phenomena. In situations of conflict and violence, women are often seen as passive, victims, subordinate and maternal, while these could be assumptions reinforcing gender stereotypes. In order to improve understandings of radicalization and gender we need to study how and why gender norms appear as an increasingly contested area of politics with strong mobilizing power. What role gender norms and equality policies play in stabilizing and destabilizing social and political order, and how ideas and norms about gender equality make people react, mobilize and engage politically, at present, in the past and in the future. The entry point for prevention and de-radicalisation efforts are local communities, which are both stakeholders and partners of the law enforcement in this process. Activities aimed at youngsters and adults have to be gender sensitive, and research has to deliver tailored advice and solutions adequately, and proportionately addressing all critical issues.Community policing with its multidisciplinary approach seeks the cooperation of local communities and the broad range of public authorities in its efforts of building safe environments. However, those efforts should recognise not only cultural, social and economic diversity of the milieus, but as mentioned above also be gender sensitive.

Scope:Cryptocurrencies are a widely used method by criminals, including terrorists, to transfer or conceal funds due to their anonymity, ease of use and lack of international borders and restrictions (exactly same aspects that make use of traditional bank routes difficult for them). With the raise of crime-as-a-service market, and growth in the number of connected transactions, use of cryptocurrency as one of the money laundering typology better tracing of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to keep the ground in the fight against crime and terrorism. On top of it all, clandestine cryptocurrency activities are increasingly facilitated by new developments such as high privacy decentralised exchanges, which while used by perpetrators frustrate the efforts of Police Authorities to detect and recover criminal assets as well as to prevent fraudulent transactions. The future of cryptocurrencies and the extent to which criminals and terrorists will use them will depend on factors such as anonymity, future regulation, law enforcement activities and security of the systems. Innovation should explore these considerations and propose mitigation measures, from legal, organisational, and technical perspectives (including the development of tools and relevant trainings to enhanced tractability of cryptocurrencies transactions.

Scope:Hate speech has harmful impacts on the individual victims, or groups of victims, but also on our society at large. Undermining the fundamental values of the EU, such as respect for human dignity, freedom and equality. Under EU law, racist and xenophobic hate motivated crime and speech are illegal. The Framework Decision on combating certain forms of expressions of racism and xenophobia[1] requires the criminalisation of public incitement to violence or hatred based on race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. The Commission's policies address also specific forms of hate speech and hate crime against groups and communities[2] (e.g., antisemitism[3], anti-Muslim hatred or anti-gypsyism[4], hate speech and hate crime relating to gender and sexual orientation[5]. In 2021, the European Commission adopted a Communication[6] which prompts a Council decision to extend the current list of EU crimes in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to all forms of hate crime and hate speech. Since 2016, the Commission's efforts in countering hate speech and hate crime also involve dedicated exchanges and tools in support to national authorities in the context of the High Level Group on combating hate speech and hate crime.Addressing hate speech from all angles increases the chance of combating it in a sustainable manner. Thus, in line with all the above initiatives and with the Victims Rights Directive[7] and the EU Strategy on Victims' Rights[8], the successful proposal is expected to reinforce hate crime training and capacity building for Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners, in particular to enhance their tools and methods for lawful detection, reporting and data/evidence collection and analysis of the hate speech related activities that are considered as crime or could lead to a crime, notably the ones supported by advanced digital technologies, such as in emerging cyber environments. By doing so, being an innovation action, the successful proposal is expected to build on previously developed tools for related applications (such as text and image matching). The successful proposal should also support the implementation of the voluntary Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online that the European Commission initiated in 2016 with IT companies, the European strategy for a better internet for kids[9], the Digital Services Act[10] and the outcomes of the ""Study on digital violent right-wing extremist content and manifestations of hate speech online”[11]. Similarly, any other relevant development, study or initiative should be taken into account. Evolutions in hate crime and hate speech, such as their sparks in times of social or economic crises (e.g. pandemics and wars) should be considered too. In order to derive effective responses and improve the understanding of the cultural and societal aspects of hate speech and hate crime, as well as of the key challenges for combating it, the successful proposal should include local, national and international dimensions, civil society perspectives, and analysis of good practices[12]. An added value of the proposal would be to also develop modern and effective awareness raising campaigns for relevant Civil Society Organisations and Police Authorities in order to pass key messages to potential victims, as well as wide communities, while taking into account European multicultural dimension.The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects, including the ones funded under topics: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised), HORIZON-CL2-2021-DEMOCRACY-01-03: Feminisms for a new age of democracy, HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-04: Education for democracy, HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05: Evolution of political extremism and its influence on contemporary social and political dialogue and HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-08: Strengthening racial, ethnic and religious equality.

Scope:Public spaces such as squares, sport venues, shopping districts, places of worship, and mass transport systems have been the target of terrorist attacks causing significant loss of lives and causing societal insecurity. Means to carry out such attacks range from sophisticated, and well-planned scenarios including several coordinated attackers using explosives and firearms, to low-cost, low-tech attacks making use of common products. Today specific urban furniture like benches, bus shelters, flower boxes, etc. already have double functions controlling access to protected areas, which answers to some of the low-cost attacks. The next logical step seems to expand their functions further and adopt new functionalities to better respond to the terrorist threats, such as for CBRN-E ones.

Scope:Internet of Things (IoT) connects practically everything and makes everything more vulnerable as well. IoT devices increasingly benefit from the convergence and integration of technologies, such as machine learning, real-time analytics as well as 5G that will provide faster and more reliable connections for all devices.There are a number of implications particular to IoT devices, which have been consistently highlighted by researchers and Police Authorities. For example, the vulnerability of IoT devices may be exploited by criminals who seek to collect personal data, compromise user credentials or spy on organisations or people. Furthermore, IoT devices may represent a threat that goes beyond the digital world, i.e. they may become an increasingly physical threat, since they find applications in, e.g., industry and infrastructure, as well as in building smart cities. Malevolent actions against connected devices with direct physical impact (e.g. car-to-car communication, hacking of vehicles, hospitals, nuclear plants) are also a growing concern.Therefore, the successful proposal should help Police Authorities understand the implications of the fast-developing IoT environment in order to keep pace with the evolution of its applications, recognise and tackle the emerging (digital and especially physical) threats that this may pose.At the same time, IoT proliferation will provide opportunities for the Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners to collect a new range of data in relation with criminal activities. New investigating schemes are needed for Police Authorities to access and exploit IoTs evidence, in compliance with EU values. To this end, the proposal should examine the extent to which, e.g., modern vehicle models, smart TVs, private surveillance systems, virtual assistants or voice control systems can be considered as sources of evidence for the collection and analysis of data, as well as how such data can be used for deriving indicators of an imminent threat.The research should assess legal, organisational and technical implications of IoT development in the context of investigations, including e.g. privacy issues, and propose strategies, including training materials, tools and path to standards that would foster 'by design” a lawful access to relevant evidence.In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the research effort.The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as create synergies with similar on-going security research projects from the Calls 2021-2022 on Fighting Crime and Terrorism and on Increased Cybersecurity, in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Possibilities of coordination with related activities in the Digital Europe Programme[1] should be analysed too.Proposals funded under this topic are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the law enforcement community. Specific Topic Conditions:Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.

It will empower SOCs which are linked to National SOCs, and to a stronger collaboration between local SOCs, National SOCs and Cross-Border SOC platforms, leading to an increased data sharing and better detection capability for cyber threats. This should in particular foster interoperability, identifying what data can be shared, how this is shared and in what format, requirements and sharing agreements, and ways to enable better exchange. Links to the actions funded under the Cybersecurity Skills Academy (in the main Digital Europe work programme) can also be envisaged.These actions should lead to increased engagement, including from the private sector, and to a better collaboration towards a common EU cyber threat knowledge base and technological independence.Additionally, Cross-Border SOC Platforms will develop a comprehensive governance framework, with for example enrolment conditions and vetting procedures. The aim is to foster discussion between such platforms, sharing best practices and identifying opportunities for collaboration.One Coordination and support action will be selected, bringing together the largest possible network of National and Cross-Border SOC platforms. Scope:Actions should address one or more of the following:Activities and technical frameworks that foster the collaboration and interconnection between Cross-Border SOC platforms and National SOCs, as well as fostering the link between National SOCs and other SOCs at national level.Actions that support the cooperation and coordination of Cross-Border SOC platforms, both between different Cross-Border SOC platforms, and with relation to national SOCs and other SOCs.Actions to foster links between public sector and industry, and stimulate mutually beneficial exchange of information, tools and data as well as exchange of knowledge and training opportunities.Actions to foster links between SOCs and industrial stakeholders in artificial intelligence and in other enabling technologies, fostering the adoption of such technologies, including AI techniques and tools rand facilitating getting acquainted with existing state of the art tools (such as for example those developed in Action 1.1.4 of this work programme) and knowledge exchange.Actions to engage stakeholders from the HPC stakeholder community and practitioners of breakthrough AI technologies, to develop a blueprint for the requirements of AI models that necessitate access to large or smaller HPC facilities, and next steps to make this happen, as well as raising awareness of this in the wider SOC community. These actions aim at creating or strengthening national and/or cross-border SOCs, which occupy a central role in ensuring the (cyber-)security of national authorities, providers of critical infrastructures and essential services. SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk.

SOCs are tasked with monitoring, understanding and proactively managing cybersecurity threats. In light of the crucial operative role of SOCs for ensuring cybersecurity in the Union, the nature of the technologies involved as well as the sensitivity of the information handled, SOCs must be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.",,,,,
DIGITAL-2024-CLOUD-DATA-AI-07-DIGITALTWIN,Towards networked Local Digital Twins in the EU,DIGITAL-GFS DIGITAL Grants for Financial Support,DIGITAL Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-07-04T00:00:00,2024-11-21T17:00:00,,20000000,20000000,,47038143,47038104DIGITALGrantsforFinancialSupport1720051200000,"ExpectedOutcome:Expected outcomes and deliverables of these three working strands are:An EU ecosystem of LDTs sharing a common blueprint.An uptake in the number of local platforms and digital twins, with associated services compatible with the EU data cloud infrastructure, reusing interoperable and open-source tools from the LDT toolbox.New AI-based services extending and supplementing the catalogue of the EU LDT toolbox for cities and communities.Increasing and maturing the AI services offering the public domain with new predictive and modelling services and immersive solutions, paving the way to the CitiVerse. Objective:Building on the Data Space for Smart Communities and the EU Local Digital Twin (LDT) Toolbox, both supported by the WP 2021-2022, and in synergy with the action 'Developing CitiVerse” (see 2.3.2), the main objective of this action is to consolidate existing results and move towards an ecosystem of mature and networked LDTs across the EU to help cities and communities achieve economies of scale when developing their data platform and LDT services.EU cities and communities are evolving towards digital communities at a different pace and this topic is proposing three complementary activities to help them achieve economies of scale when adopting data, LDT and AI-based solutions. Previous WP supported the creation of an EU data space for smart communities (and its validation via pilots) and action 2.3.2 pioneers innovative services using 'Citiverse' technology. Under the WP 2021-22, the Commission has also launched procurement actions to support the development of a LDT toolbox in the EU. However, more effort is needed to create a pan-European ecosystem of digital twins that can connect and scale up towards a future 'EU CitiVerse”. To achieve the approach is to support the development of open source LDT solutions based on common needs of EU cities and communities (both urban and rural), to connect them and to enrich them with additional innovative services. In order to address the different maturity level of cities and communities, this action will help (1) connect and further develop the already existing LDTs, (2) gain a critical mass of smart communities' data sets, as well as (3) deploy, test, and add more complex AI-based elements to the LDT toolbox, addressing the needs of digitally advanced smart communities.These and future actions regarding LDTs are contributing to the effective implementation of a Multi Country Project (MCP) in the area of Connected Public Administration.The action is divided in three objectives, each to be achieved through a separate work strand:Objective 1: Technical inter-connection of existing LDTs: Connecting data platforms and LDTs from cities and communities that already have a LDT in place, in order to create an EU 'federation” of LDTs. Reinforced interoperability through the aggregation of LDTs at a larger scale (cross sectors, cross cities, and cross borders) will help to scale up the EU common data sets and open-source solutions. It will also facilitate the way for less advanced cities and communities who wish to join the existing EU LDT ecosystem.Objective 2: Creation of LDTs based on common needs: Developing open-source pilots of LDTs services, based on shared needs of cities and communities that already have a local data platform and/or a LDT and want to expand them with new real-life use case services. These services should aim to improve decision-making processes and citizen interaction; reduce risks, costs and downtime; enhance resilience and sustainability of LDT platforms and enable new value creation.Objective 3: Adding new complex AI-based tools to the LDTs toolbox: Complementing the EU LDT toolbox launched under WP2021-22 with additional complex AI-based and innovative services (e.g., for adaptable multi-sector considerations, advanced simulation and modelling approaches including bottom-up self-organised models). The AI services should be developed and tested within existing cities/communities and be transferable to other contexts. These objectives will be implemented through three work strands by a single project that will provide cascading funding to the third parties through a single call. Scope:The selected proposal will manage a community of projects selected by cascading funding mechanism. The work of these projects will be implemented through three main work strands:Work strand 1: Connect existing LDTs at EU level and lay down the foundations of an EU LDT ecosystem. When connecting LDTs, and their related data sets, projects should align with the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl to achieve interoperability and make use of horizontal services available under the Digital Europe programme such as the Smart Communities dataspace blueprint, the EU data cloud infrastructure and the EU LDT toolbox.Work strand 2: Launch new pilot LDT services based on common needs of cities and communities to enhance interoperability and collaboration. The services should be tested in real-life conditions and expand the EU LDT ecosystem by making use of and contributing to the development of the EU LDT toolbox catalogue. The pilots should include at least the following activities: designing real life use cases based on open and interoperable data sets across sectors. The use of these data sets should follow requirements of the data space for smart cities and communities' blueprint;building and deploying the pilot services on LDT platforms at city/community level with real use case data;defining roadmaps for making available the LDT-based services on the EU LDT toolbox catalogue Work strand 3: Add new complex AI-based components to the forthcoming EU LDT toolbox to address the needs of cities/communities: Develop and deliver new AI-based services to create simulations, predictive models and forecast in a variety of sectors and use cases amongst which the New European Bauhaus, public services and communities' resilience;Develop and deliver solutions for designing, optimising, and testing urban policies in dynamic complex environments with several interwoven sectors (e.g., traffic volume and pollution levels). AI classical optimization may be complemented with self-organised bottom-up solutions that will offer the necessary adaptability and robustness;Develop and deliver new complex AI-based services related to citizen's engagement, with or without the use of eXtended Reality technology to address aspects of the New European Bauhaus initiative and implement a sustainable, democratic and citizen-centric CitiVerse. To maximize the scale-up and reusability of the new services, these should be designed in such a way that they can be adopted by different maturity levels LDT architectures.",,,,,
DIGITAL-2024-ADVANCED-DIGITAL-07-KEYCAPACITY,Specialised Education Programmes in Key Capacity Areas,DIGITAL-LS DIGITAL Lump Sum Grants,DIGITAL Lump Sum Grant,single-stage,2024-07-04T00:00:00,2024-11-21T17:00:00,,55000000,55000000,6,46813160,46813062DIGITALLumpSumGrants1720051200000,"Objective:This topic aims at contributing to the target of reaching 20 million ICT specialists in the EU by 2030, while promoting gender convergence, as set in the Digital Decade Policy Programme. Gains from major breakthroughs in key capacity digital technological areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, data analytics, virtual worlds, photonics, quantum, cloud and edge computing, and others) cannot materialise if there are not enough people with adequate knowledge to develop, deploy and use those digital technologies and their related applications. Evidence from the Structured Dialogue on digital education and skills with Member States shows that a majority of Member States expressed concerns about the shortage of ICT specialists1. Even in Member States that are digital frontrunners, there is a persistent shortage of people able to develop and deploy key digital technologies2. There also is a significant increase in the demand for professionals combining sectoral knowledge with digital skills enabling the use of digital solutions for specific business cases. This is for example the case of employees in the manufacturing sector able to use augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) tools to repair engines remotely, software developers and engineers with specific automotive expertise, or professionals in industrial sectors that are key to the green transition who are increasingly relying on advanced digital technologies in the development of renewable energy or clean and smart mobility solutions. These profiles can be referred to as users of advanced digital technologies and they are crucial to enable and support the digitalisation of traditional industrial sectors from agriculture and finance to manufacturing, automotive and medicine, and are key to achieve the twin green and digital transition.Looking at the related education offer, the 2022 JRC report shows that the offer of specialised education programme in AI, cybersecurity, HPC and data science has slightly improved in the EU 27, in particular in AI, where the number of Master programmes has increased by 20% compared to the previous year. However, it remains lower than in the United States. For cybersecurity the United Kingdom alone continue to offer as many programmes as all EU Member States together3.The actions in the skills pillar therefore aim at tackling this challenge, while triggering a new way of delivering these programmes, building partnerships between academia, businesses and research across the EU.1 SWD (2023) 205 final: COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT accompanying the documents: Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the key enabling factors for successful digital education and training and Proposal for a Council Recommendation on improving the provision of digital skills in education and training {COM(2023) 205 final}2 For example, over 70% of enterprises looking for ICT specialists in the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg found it extremely difficult to recruit ICT specialists. DESI 2022, https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-economy-and-society-index-desi-2022.3 https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC128844/JRC128844_01.pdf Scope:The first calls for Master's programmes' in the Digital Europe Programme have supported the development of excellent consortia delivering education programmes and self-standing modules to build up advanced digital skills in key digital areas, mainly AI and cybersecurity4, as well as interdisciplinary programmes targeting the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific sectors, such as health. The call of 2023 built on the experience of the first work programme5, addressing the latest initiatives to support the development and deployment of key digital skills and capacities in digital technology areas, such as AI, data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, as well as other inter-, trans- or multi-disciplinary areas, and their applications in strategic sectors. The call of 2024 will support the development and deployment of key digital skills in selected digital areas: virtual worlds, edge computing, quantum computing, photonics, and robotics and automatization. The call will also support interdisciplinary programmes that will target the acquisition of advanced green digital skills (e.g. in the area of AI, data analytics, virtual/augmented reality, robotics, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, etc.) in selected strategic sectors: agriculture, transport, renewable energy, waste management, as well as the acquisition of advanced digital skills for government and public sector. In the selected digital areas and strategic sectors there is a high demand for ICT specialists (and is expected to further grow), but at the same time the offer of education programmes for these areas/sectors is limited, what will hinder their potential for economic uptake and growth. The call should also support possible cooperation in the context of ongoing international cooperation related to digital topics (e.g. digital partnerships, trade and technology councils, policy dialogues, Talent Growth Task Force), e.g. by supporting students from those countries with financial support (e.g. via scholarships, fee waivers, or others) to participate in the education programmes including promoting female students participation. The proposals should clearly identify one digital area or one strategic sector as the main focus of their work and the challenges addressed. It is expected to fund at least the highest-ranking proposal from each above listed digital area or strategic sector providing that all thresholds are attain and within the limits of the budget available for this topic.Projects financed under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and complementarities with actions on technology deployment supported by other pillars of the programme as well as links and synergies with programmes and initiatives like Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances, Erasmus+ Alliances for Innovation, European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), the EIT Campus, the Deep Tech Talent Initiative and its possible follow-up initiatives, as well as the Large Scale Partnerships under the Pact for Skills.The primary objective of this topic is to support the design and deliver a higher degree education programme(s) (at ISCED levels 6 (Bachelor's or equivalent level), 7 (Master's or equivalent level) or equivalent in 2023 and at ISCED levels 6, 7, 8 (doctoral or equivalent level) in 2024 - hereafter education programmes and to develop related self-standing modules, in selected key digital areas and for the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific strategic sectors. Besides the design and delivery of new educational programmes and self-standing modules, the selected projects can cover activities to attract qualified teaching staff, scholarships for students, the purchase or leasing costs for equipment, and different activities to establish partnership between academia, industry and research centers. The selected projects will also bring a clear EU added-value to the proposed education activities (such as cross-border collaborations, networks and exchange of ideas).4 Previous calls prioritised key digital areas were: Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Cybersecurity, Data, Extended reality, Internet of Things, Microelectronics, Photonics, Quantum, Robotics.5 List of selected projects from previous DIGITAL programme calls are and will be available on the Funding and Tenders portal (i.e. DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED and DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU). Expected Impact:Deliverables:Consortia of higher education institutions, research organisations and businesses and other stakeholders design and deliver education programmes and self-standing modules in the area of advanced digital skills for developers and users of advanced digital technologies.Higher education institutions are upgraded with digital solutions, equipment and infrastructure, with a special focus on interoperability of IT systems.Students are supported with scholarships (for participating in education programmes and internships), or via other financial and support measures.Structural and sustainable partnerships between members of the consortium are established.
