With the raise of crime-as-a-service market, and growth in the number of connected transactions, use of cryptocurrency as one of the money laundering typology better tracing of cryptocurrency transactions is crucial to keep the ground in the fight against crime and terrorism. On top of it all, clandestine cryptocurrency activities are increasingly facilitated by new developments such as high privacy decentralised exchanges, which while used by perpetrators frustrate the efforts of Police Authorities to detect and recover criminal assets as well as to prevent fraudulent transactions. The future of cryptocurrencies and the extent to which criminals and terrorists will use them will depend on factors such as anonymity, future regulation, law enforcement activities and security of the systems. Innovation should explore these considerations and propose mitigation measures, from legal, organisational, and technical perspectives (including the development of tools and relevant trainings to enhanced tractability of cryptocurrencies transactions.

The massive scale of this foreseen upgrade shows that preparations are needed today in order to widely implement the relevant mitigations in the future.

This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).</p><p>The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.</p><p>Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.</p><p>This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.</p><p>Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf</a>]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN</a>]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.</p><p>Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls.

The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.</p><p>The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.</p><p>In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:</p><ul><li>Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027).</li><li><p>Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes.</p></li></ul><p>The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.</p><p>In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&amp;I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.</p><p>The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.</p><p>It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.</p><p>Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>Leadership in AI based on trust</li></ul><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.</p><p>Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.</p><p><strong>EIT Digital</strong> plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ?</p><ul><li>An Internet of Trust</li></ul><p>The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.</p><ul><li>eXtended Reality (XR)</li></ul><p>Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and condition</p><p>The objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.</p><ul><li>Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry.</li></ul><p>This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.</p><ul><li>Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies</li></ul><p>The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade?), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.</p><p>In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.</p><p>Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.</p><ul><li>European standards for industrial competitiveness</li></ul><p>The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.</p><p>Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.</p><p>Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&amp;I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.</p><p>Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.</p><ul><li>International cooperation</li></ul><p>The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.</p><p>Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&amp;I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.</p><p>Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&amp;I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020</a>]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment).

HORIZON-EIC-2024-PATHFINDERCHALLENGES-01-02,Towards cement and concrete as a carbon sink,HORIZON-EIC HORIZON EIC Grants,HORIZON Lump Sum Grant,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-10-16T17:00:00,,500000,4000000,6,46553294,46553282HORIZONEICGrants1718841600000,"<span>Scope</span>:<p><strong>Background and scope:</strong></p><p>Cement is the largest manufactured product in the world by mass. In 2022 humans produced 4,2 billion tons of it (about 626 kg per capita). Combined with water, sand and aggregates cement is the glue to form concrete. Aside from water, there is no material we use more than concrete. Contractors can combine concrete with steel reinforcement bars to mould and create the build environment in which we experience our lives. The industry is interrelated with other major sectors such as energy and steel. Its supply chains are vast, deeply complex, with increasing degrees of fragmentation going downstream. This complexity is also reflected in the many ways cement and concrete markets can be (sub-) segmented, for example by cement use (concrete, mortar, etc.), concrete use (reinforced, non-reinforced, ready-mix, precast products, etc.), end-use (residential, non-residential, infrastructural, energy, etc.) to name a few.</p><p>Cement and concrete are versatile, low-cost, abundant and relatively local. Modern societies are hard to imagine without these materials. Realistically, cement and concrete are here to stay. Then again, current mainstream cement and concrete technologies are also the source of 8% of our CO2 emissions (about 600 kg per capita), which are 'embodied? in our buildings and infrastructures. Roughly 60% of these emissions are 'chemical? released by converting limestone into clinker, and 40% of doing so at very high temperatures by burning fossil fuels. With EU (and global) commitments for rapid and radical emission reductions, it is necessary to pull all scientific, economic, and regulatory levers to reduce the environmental impacts of the cement and concrete sector.</p><p>One default pathway to decarbonize cement (and indeed a major element in the sector's strategy to decarbonize to net-zero by 2050) is to capture and store CO2 of current production processes (CCS). Technologies for CCS are in development and expected to increase the cost of cement. To avoid additional costs of future emissions as much as possible, accelerated deep-tech innovations are needed to fully negate or even absorb emissions by the sector in future. The breakthrough innovations sought with this Pathfinder Challenge aim to be more cost effective than CCS. Moreover, this Pathfinder Challenge encourages breakthrough innovations that utilize CO2. Such innovations can play an important role in future CCUS economies, and trigger future revenue opportunities for the sector by offering negative emissions at scale. However, CCS/CCUS technologies that are unrelated to cement and concrete technologies are out of scope of this Pathfinder Challenge.</p><p>This Pathfinder Challenge seeks to support breakthrough innovations and (alternative) pathways for decarbonized and carbon-negative cement and concrete. Future pathways must meet some important conditions to be ultimately successful.</p><ul><li>The economical and abundant availability of feedstock at the place of production (cement) and consumption (concrete) is an important condition for implementing practically viable alternative cement chemistries, concrete mixtures and substitute materials.</li><li>Most of the consumption growth of cement (and associated CO2 emissions) is expected in developing nations. Therefore, if innovative (deep-tech) solutions for cementitious materials are to be adopted on a significant scale (a condition for 'disruptive innovation?) they shall (at least in potential) be low cost and used easily by people with minimal training and scientific knowledge.</li><li>Ultimate success and technology adoption shall depend on meeting or exceeding the mechanical and operational performance levels of the incumbent mainstream cement and concrete technologies, which are also reflected in the various norms and standards.</li></ul><p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p><p>This challenge is supporting the development of breakthrough technologies in one or more of the following domains:</p><p>(1) Advanced technologies that change the paradigm of prevailing binder technologies with alternative low-carbon compounds based on alternative feedstocks (e/g magnesia-based, (ultra-) mafic rocks), and curing processes (e/g carbonation curing), and the combination thereof. Widespread adoption of such radical new pathways will also need breakthrough innovations in energy efficient industrial production processes. Such engineered carbon mineralisation pathways (e/g MOMS) can in principle utilize and store large amounts of CO2 with high permanence and (CCUS) value in the final mortar and (reinforced) concrete applications. As the alternative feedstocks often formed the host rocks for valuable ores, some mine waste could contain accessible, abundant, and useful raw materials.</p><p>(2) Advanced technologies for a more efficient use of clinker in cement (reducing its clinker fraction), and of cement in concrete compositions (binder efficiency).</p><ul><li>For cement, radical innovations are sought that further extend the use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), and that give access to novel, abundantly available alternative sources of reactive SCMs compared to the prevailing SCM materials that have limited (or even declining) availability.</li><li>For concrete, the amount of binder used to produce concretes of a given strength can vary considerably (e/g depending on use case and geographical location). This points to substantial CO2 mitigation potential with innovations that solve for a consistently more efficient use of cement, for example. through innovations that optimize and control particle size distribution (e/g more sophisticated grinding processes) in combination with compatible admixtures, and technologies that support industrialization to reduce variability of binder intensity and reduce waste.</li></ul><p>Novel reinforcement technologies may further improve efficient use of cement in reinforced concrete (e/g consumption driven by concerns about steel corrosion), and may be necessary for novel pathways for cement and concrete technologies that are not compatible with steel reinforcement.</p><ul><li>Novel pathways for compatible and equally performing 'synthetic aggregates? may offer additional potential for CCUS at the concrete-mix level.</li></ul><p>(3) Advanced technologies that lower or negate the need for burning fossil fuels to avoid the associated CO2 emissions. For example, novel breakthrough process innovations to manufacture decarbonized lime (e/g at low process temperatures, by non-thermal processes, electrified processes).</p><p>(4) Enabling technologies in support of (1), (2) and (3) based on technologies for computational material science or data-driven science (including AI and ML). There is a need for breakthrough simulation and prediction technologies that enhance the understanding of the characteristics and interactions of raw materials, hydration processes and microstructural development of cementitious materials. If generalizable technologies can be adapted to a wide variety and variation of real-world raw materials without the need for extensive local empirical testing, this would greatly enhance and accelerate development cycles, knowledge acquisition, discovery, and implementation.</p><p><strong>Expected outcomes and impacts:</strong></p><p>Project results must clearly demonstrate validation in laboratory environment (TRL4) of the breakthrough technology.</p><p>The portfolio of projects selected under this Pathfinder Challenge is expected to cover the four (4) domains mentioned in the previous section. The collaboration between the selected projects is expected to be mutually beneficial and contribute to a further reduction of carbon emissions of cement and concrete. For example, the projects selected under 1, 2 and 3 will be required to closely collaborate with the project selected under 4, so that this project can provide additional guidance to the projects on plausible pathways.</p><p>In addition, projects are required to develop common metrics and terminology to compare project results. The results of each project shall include a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimation of the potential impact the breakthrough technology can have on emission reductions. A portfolio activity that results in quantitatively stating the decarbonization potential of all portfolio projects combined is encouraged.</p><p>Also, portfolio activities to develop techno-economic views on the future implementation, adoption, and scaling potential of the various technologies in realistic real-world conditions, coupled with a view on an entrepreneurial path towards future commercialisation are strongly encouraged. Realistic expectations of operational conditions in those markets where future growth is expected most is critical for the adoption of innovative technologies at scale. For example, feed stocks required for some novel pathways may be found at different locations than existing quarries and cement plants. This requires a strategic rethinking of the cement and concrete value chains and distribution channels in target markets. Also, novel pathways utilizing CO2 for curing will require a stream of (likely) purified CO2, which triggers additional supply chain considerations. Other novel pathways may adopt to existing cement and concrete value chains and distribution channels as an innovation strategy for fast scaling and wide market adoption.</p><p>Any innovation that offers a reduction of CO2 emissions shall still enable, meet, or exceed the performance and workability criteria of the incumbent products it enhances or substitutes by the time of market adoption, as referenced by various industry norms and standards. It is expected that the collaboration between the portfolio projects will positively contribute to the understanding of this topic.</p><p>In the long run, it is expected that project results will form the basis for the development of novel cement and concrete products, production processes, and other solutions that impact the sector in its efforts to decarbonize and even absorb CO2 in step with the ambitions of the European Green Deal.</p><p>The portfolio of supported projects shall also contribute to medium to long-term impacts such as increasing EU technological leadership and reducing EU dependency on critical raw materials supply.</p>",,,,,

The EIC Accelerator provides a unique combination of funding <strong>from EUR 0.5 to EUR 17.5 million</strong> and <strong>Business Acceleration Services</strong> (see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eic.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/EIC-workprogramme-2024.pdf#page=96"">Section V of the EIC Work programme 2024</a>).</p><p>The EIC Accelerator focuses in particular on innovations building on scientific discovery or technological breakthroughs ('deep tech') and where significant funding is needed over a long timeframe before returns can be generated ('patient capital'). Such innovations often struggle to attract financing because the risks and time period involved are too high. Funding and support from the EIC Accelerator is designed to enable such innovators to attract the full investment amounts needed for scale up in a shorter timeframe.</p><p>The EIC Accelerator supports the later stages of technology development as well as scale up. The technology component of your innovation must therefore have been tested and validated in a laboratory and other relevant environment (e.g.,at least Technology Readiness Level 5). The EIC Accelerator looks to support companies where the EIC support will act as a catalyst to crowd in other investors necessary for the scale up of the innovation.</p><p>Applicants to EIC Accelerator can submit proposals through:</p><ul><li><strong>EIC Accelerator Open</strong>, which has no predefined thematic priorities and is open to proposals in any field of technology or application;</li><li><strong>EIC Accelerator Challenges</strong> in predefined areas of emerging and strategic technologies</li></ul><p>For further information please see the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eic.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-12/EIC-workprogramme-2024.pdf"">EIC Work Programme 2024</a>.</p>",,,,,

Obtaining this Quality Label is a precondition for participation only in volunteering activities in support of humanitarian aid operations.</p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF QUALITY LABEL?</strong></p><p>When applying for a Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering, applicant organisations can choose one of the following roles:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Support role</u></strong> - entails supporting, preparing and/or training participants before departure, mediation between them and their host organisations and/or providing support to participants upon return from their activity. The support role also entitles the organisation to submit project applications and coordinate partnerships for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering projects;</li><li><strong><u>Host role</u></strong> - covers the full range of activities related to hosting a Solidarity Corps participant, including the development of a programme of the young person's activities and providing guidance and support to the participant during all the phases as appropriate</li></ul><p><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK?</strong></p><p>The Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering is awarded following a selection process, involving three main stages: submission of application, assessment and award.</p><p>The applications for the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering can be submitted on a continuous basis (i.e. at any time) during the programming period, to the Executive Agency, which is the sole implementing body for this action. The applications will be evaluated at set intervals, according to an annual timetable, which is aligned to the timetable of the Humanitarian Aid Volunteering call for projects.</p><p>Applications will be assessed against eligibility, selection, exclusion and award criteria (for more information on the selection and exclusion criteria, see Part E of this Guide). Successful organisations will be awarded the Quality Label for Humanitarian Aid Volunteering. The Executive Agency will award this Quality Label and monitor compliance and may carry out periodical reassessments. The Quality Label will be valid for the entire duration of the programming period and until the end of the last project in which the organisation is involved.</p><p>In order to facilitate partner-finding and the setting up of project consortia, profiles of all organisations holding this Quality Label are published in a database of Quality Label organisations on the European Solidarity Corps Portal. To identify potential partners, partner searching tool on the Funding and Tender Opportunities Portal can be used.</p><p>Once awarded a Quality Label, organisations gain access to the European Solidarity Corps Portal where they are invited to advertise activities. Organisations have to make use of the European Solidarity Corps Portal's database to search for potential partners and participants. Information in the database is published as it is formulated in the Quality Label application form.</p><p><strong>APPLYING FOR A QUALITY LABEL ON BEHALF OF HOSTING ORGANISATION - THE SIMPLIFIED HOST PROCEDURE</strong></p><p>An organisation established in a programme country that applies for support role may also apply for host role on behalf of its branches located in non programme countries with which it shares the same legal personality (simplified hosting procedure). This procedure is designed to help larger organisations, with several branches located in different countries.</p><p>The applicant supporting organisation is accountable for the quality and safety of activities offered by simplified hosting organisation(s) on behalf of which it is applying.</p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE QUALITY STANDARDS?</strong></p><p>The European Solidarity Corps guarantees high-quality volunteering activities, through the Quality Label process. Participating organisations must respect the following principles and standards:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Equal opportunities and non-discrimination</u></strong>. Volunteers are to be selected in a fair, transparent and objective way, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion or disability. No previous qualifications, educational level, specific experience or language knowledge must be required. A more specific profile of the volunteer might be drawn up if justified by the nature of the tasks of the activity or by the project context. In order to promote inclusion, participation in volunteering activities must be free of charge for the volunteer, with the exception of possible contributions to travel costs (if the grant does not fully cover these costs). The activities should respect the principles set out in Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</li><li><u><strong>Avoidance of job substitution</strong>.</u> Volunteering activities must not substitute traineeships or jobs, so that any adverse effect on potential or existing paid employment is avoided. The involvement of volunteers should complement the work of paid staff. They should not replace paid staff or undercut their pay and conditions of service.</li><li><strong><u>Avoidance of harmful activities</u></strong>. Security and safety of the participants, participating organisations and target groups must be ensured. Such security and safety should include appropriate clearance requirements for participants working with vulnerable groups in accordance with applicable national law. Volunteering activities should be implemented with due consideration for the impact of unforeseen circumstances such as environmental crises, conflicts or pandemics. The activities should respect the principles set out in the EU Guidelines for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of the Child (https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/sites/antitrafficking/files/eu_guidelines_rights_of_child_0.pdf)</li><li><strong><u>Provision of high quality, easily accessible and inclusive activities</u></strong>. The volunteering tasks should enable participants to develop skills and competencies for personal, social and civic development. Particular attention will be given to the capacity of hosting organisations in third countries and the need to embed the activities of volunteers within the local context and to facilitate volunteers' interaction with local humanitarian actors, the hosting community and civil society. The value and benefits of European Solidarity Corps volunteering should be recognised for volunteers, through validation of learning outcomes.</li><li><strong><u>Adequate training, working and volunteering arrangements</u></strong>. Safe and decent living and working conditions must be ensured for participants. The young people and the organisations must sign a volunteering agreement that will outline the rights and responsibilities of both parties and will include a well-defined set of volunteering tasks.</li><li><strong><u>'no profit?</u></strong>. In accordance with the Financial Regulation, beneficiaries must not derive any profit from the activities funded by the grants awarded. Furthermore, volunteering should cover the participants' expenditure arising from participation in such solidarity activities but should not provide them with salaries or an economic benefit.</li></ul><p><strong>TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ORGANISATIONS HOLDING A QUALITY LABEL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID VOLUNTEERING</strong></p><p>In addition to complying with the above-mentioned principles, organisations implementing humanitarian aid volunteering projects must carry out specific tasks and responsibilities in order to ensure high quality activities. When applying for a Quality Label, organisations must be able to demonstrate their capacity to perform the tasks and take up responsibilities relevant to the role they are applying for, as outlined in the requirements below. This list is not comprehensive and, in some cases, the set of tasks and responsibilities may overlap between host and support organisations, without prejudice to the overall quality of the

Striving towards excellence requires a stronger R&amp;I system where best practice is disseminated faster across the European Union. The strategic plan for Horizon Europe aims to underpin geographical diversity, building the necessary capacity to allow successful participation in the R&amp;I process and to promote networking and access to excellence thus optimising the impact of Pillar 2 and contributing to the objectives of the entire programme.</p><p>This destination will address 'improving access to excellence? through a portfolio of complementary actions that aim to build up R&amp;I capacities in Widening countries, as well as through national and regional R&amp;I reforms and investments, to enable them to advance to the competitive edge at European and international level. It will contribute to the development of a pan European innovation ecosystem and thus to innovation. This portfolio also constitutes the widening dimension of a broader European Excellence Initiative that reaches out beyond this programme as it is implemented in conjunction with ERASMUS+.</p><p>Each of the seven proposed calls addresses a different target group of potential beneficiaries with a customised intervention logic. The use and appropriate design of partnerships with leading institutions abroad will be a key driver for accessing excellence. The intervention logic is designed to work points at a multitude of scales ranging from individual researcher through career development, focused networks, institutional development to a systemic impact on national R&amp;I systems.</p><p>Capacity building will go beyond purely scientific scope as it encompasses the development of management and administrative competencies for the benefit of institutions (notably in Twinning and the European Excellence Initiative) eager to take over consortium leadership roles especially under Pillar 2. Teaming actions will create new or modernise existing centres of excellence by means of close and strategic partnerships with leading institutions abroad. The impact will be amplified by the conditionality of securing complementary investment (especially for infrastructure, building, hardware) from the structural funds or other sources. Once established the centres will function as lighthouses with far reaching impact and role models for attracting the best talents. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the success of modern governance and management, and thus stimulate generalised reforms in the national R&amp;I landscape.</p><p>Two new actions will complement this portfolio as catalysts for better impact and sustainability of the widening actions. The dissemination and exploitation support facility will help beneficiaries of widening actions to improve the effectiveness of their dissemination and exploitation and unlock new sources of funding. The pathways to excellence scheme will unlock synergies of Horizon projects with funds under the cohesion policy in Widening countries.</p><p>In a complementary manner with a focus on the academic and higher education system, the university-related scheme will foster reforms in Widening countries embedded in dynamic university alliances in Europe. Scientific excellence in the more traditional sense is the aim of Twinning where focused networks with excellent partners will develop new promising R&amp;I domains and test novel approaches in smaller joint research projects.</p><p>Innovation excellence is the focus of excellence hubs where innovation ecosystems in Widening countries and beyond will team up and strive to create better links between academia, business, government and society that will foster a real placed-based innovation culture in Widening countries based on a strategic agenda in line with regional or national smart specialisation strategies. In this context, synergies will be sought with the programme parts of the European Innovation Ecosystems and the European Institute of Innovation &amp; Technology (EIT).</p><p>In addition, particular attention will be paid to cross-cutting objectives set for Horizon Europe, such as gender equality and open science practices, through the different funded actions.</p><p><u>Expected impact</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contribute to the following expected impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased science and innovation capacity for all actors in the R&amp;I system in Widening countries;</li><li>Structural changes leading to modernised and more competitive R&amp;I systems in eligible countries;</li><li>Reformed R&amp;I systems and institutions leading to increased attractiveness and retention of research talents;</li><li>Mobilisation of national and EU resources for strategic investments;</li><li>Higher participation success in Horizon Europe and more consortium leadership roles;</li><li>Stronger links between academia and business and improved career permeability;</li><li>Strengthened role of the Higher Education sector in research and innovation;</li><li>Greater involvement of regional actors in the R&amp;I process;</li><li>Improved outreach to international level for all actors.</li></ul>",,,

Accordingly, projects under this priority are intended to raise the fundamental rights knowledge of relevant actors. Building on the central role of civil society organisations and human rights defenders, funded projects could involve national, regional and local authorities as partners (co-applicants), with the aim of supporting joint capacity building and awareness raising efforts.</p><p>The projects funded under this priority could address the capacity building and awareness raising needs on the Charter <strong>in general</strong>, or they could focus on <strong>one or several</strong> of the topics below:</p><p><em>? Rights enshrined in the Charter and awareness of the Charter's scope of application<strong>.</strong></em>In accordance with its Article 51, the Charter is applicable to Member States only when they are implementing EU law. Given the specific scope of application of this instrument, unlike that of international human rights agreements, and considering the increasing number of references to the Charter in the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU, there is a specific need to promote an understanding of when the Charter applies, i.e. when EU law is being implemented, and of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter. Relevant projects could therefore focus on the scope of application of the Charter and/or on the contents of an individual Charter right and/or several rights.</p><p><em>? Protecting fundamental rights in the digital age. </em>To follow up on the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/2021-annual-report-application-charter-fundamental-rights_en"">Annual Charter Report 2021</a> on fundamental rights in the digital age, the aim of the priority is to protect fundamental rights by strengthening accountability for the use of automation where rights are at stake. This includes approaches for addressing and combatting bias and multiple/intersectional discrimination based on gender and on other grounds including ethnic and racial origin, caused or intensified by the use of <strong>artificial intelligence systems</strong>. Projects could aim to develop guidelines (including measures that ensure gender sensitive implementation), technical benchmarks and tools, including for algorithm-audits. Projects are expected to develop a concrete tool or a benchmark process in an area of the applicant's choice with demonstrated relevance for fundamental rights, without prescribing the area or the type of the tool (e.g. it could be software, a benchmark data set, a simulation environment, a procedure).</p>",,,,,

Hatred affects the individual victims and the groups they belong to, generates societal polarisation and silences wide sectors of the population, weakening pluralism and undermining respectful public democratic debates. The online world has amplified the negative effects of hate speech. Hate crimes are a direct violation of the victims' fundamental right to dignity, to equality and non-discrimination. Combating hate speech and hate crime is therefore a key part of the Commission's action to promote EU values and to ensure that the Charter is upheld.</p><p>At EU level, the 2008 Council Framework Decision requires the criminalisation of certain forms of hate speech and hate crimes. Also, the Commission adopted a Communication in December 2021 inviting the Council of the European Union to extend the legal basis for EU-level criminalisation to other forms of hate speech and hate crime beyond the racist and xenophobic grounds already covered by the Framework Decision.</p><p>Recently, the EU is experiencing an alarming increase in hate speech and hate crime, including physical and online attacks targeting in particular the Jewish and Muslim communities in Europe. The Joint Communication on 'No Place for Hate? confirms a strong commitment to step up EU efforts to fight hatred in all its forms, by reinforcing action across a variety of policies.</p><p>As recognised by the Communication, civil society organisations play a crucial role in combating hate speech and hate crime,<em></em>thereby safeguarding and promoting fundamental rights. Projects under this priority should aim to enable civil society organisations to establish mechanisms of cooperation with public authorities in particular to support the reporting and recording of episodes of hate crime and hate speech; to ensure support to victims of hate speech and hate crime; and to support law enforcement, including through training or data collection methodologies and tools. Projects should also focus on activities to tackle hate speech online, including reporting content to IT companies, designing countering narrative and awareness raising campaigns, and educational activities to address the societal challenges of hate speech online.</p>",,,,,

This will help the start-ups overcome the challenge of raising early investment that women founders often face.</p><p>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Service 3 Investor and Export Readiness Check:</strong> Using a structured approach with questions on the core business areas, the start-ups will be assessed on team, product, market, finance, operations and IP in order to determine if they are ready to pitch in front of investors, or present to potential clients. Women entrepreneurs tend to doubt themselves a million times more than male counterparts so practising with one of our experts will build confidence, and if there are areas that need attention, they will be helped to address those before pitching. Connections with EIT Food programme in internationalization RocketUp will be sought, when possible.</p><p>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Service 4 - Soft Skills Training</strong>: Since the Women TechEU start-ups are at the beginning of their entrepreneurial journey, the women entrepreneurs will be offered development content on soft skills areas like public speaking, presentation, leadership skills, improve productivity by using AI, and more. Given that they come from the deep tech sector, their hard skills will be top-notch, but we want to train them to become an all-rounder with our blended courses (mix of in-person and recorded sessions).</p><p>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Service 5 - Sales Strategy &amp; Execution:</strong> The go-to-market strategy is the area where most companies fail. We see this in front of investors as well as in pitches to competition or awards juries. Here at Women TechEU we expect the companies to be even more embryonic in their understanding of how to find leads, how to fill their pipeline, when and what to say upon follow up and even how to tune the pricing models to the right target group of clients. Women entrepreneurs tend to be less aggressive in their sales strategy and we want to instil in them the knowledge and confidence that it is ok to ask for money for services and products.</p><p>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Service 6 - Environmental Impact Assessment: </strong>The environmental impact of technology and business models from entrepreneurs is a growing area of interest to investors. Women TechEU will offer the service of climate impact projections to support women entrepreneurs to understand the environmental impact of their innovations and help them design sustainable and impactful business models from the outset. The service leverages an online tool designed for start-ups, based on the benchmark Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. Users can explore new options to make a positive climate impact reducing CO2eq emissions of their business model and deep tech innovation. It can also measure health, ecotoxicity, and resource depletion like rare earth minerals.</p><p>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Service 7 - Corporate Access:</strong> Leveraging the large network of corporates provided by EIT KICs, this service provides a platform for women-led start-ups to connect with potential partners and customers. As women are underrepresented in the corporate world, this service offers a great opportunity for women-led start-ups in Europe to expand their reach, showcase their innovative solutions, and secure valuable partnerships that can help them achieve their business goals.</p><p>At the moment of submission, the applicant will select her top three services that she would like to get from Women TechEU project. During the execution of the Programme of Services selected services from the EIC Business Accelerator Service will also be offered.</p>",

This topic focuses on products used in soil, for example mulch films, tarpaulins, geonets, geotextiles, geomembranes, etc. and plastics applications in agriculture, for example, greenhouses, pheromones dispensers, clips, pots etc; select one or more product categories, providing a justification of the selection based on the relevance of products in the actual market and/or on environmental considerations (e.g., the threats posed by the conventional non-biodegradable solutions for the same applications). </li><li>The topic does not cover marine and aquatic applications as a main focus. However, spill over of the developed product streams towards other replication sectors (including marine/aquatic) can be considered, in order to widen market applications.</li><li>Design the products for biodegradation in soil according to the environmental conditions and application timeframe, while ensuring technical performances meeting market requirements throughout the useful life of the product. Moreover, the topic also addresses eco-design and testing of reusability and/or recyclability depending on the final application(s) and use conditions.</li><li>Demonstrate safe biodegradability of bio-based products designed for specific applications in open environments (soil) under ranges of physical/chemical environmental conditions, including extreme conditions (e.g., temperature, pH) where applicable. Safe biodegradability entails avoiding eco-toxicity, microplastic dispersion and any environmental impacts - from bio-based products including their additives and other components- on natural ecosystems and their services, including on the soil fertility, during and after degradation. All these aspects should be monitored and assessed, also in the phase of dispersion in runoff water. </li><li>Perform validation trials of the developed bio-based products with the involvement of end users (for example, in case of applications for agriculture are selected, primary sector should be involved).</li><li>Develop a proposal for appropriate labelling of products when applicable and provide clear instructions on their use and on disposal options after use. This task should include the consultation of targeted stakeholders, e.g., end users. Training of end users should also be envisaged.</li><li>Contribute with recommendations related to standards for biodegradability in soil.</li><li>Include a task for projects funded under this topic to collaborate and align the proposals for appropriate labelling, and the recommendations related to standards. </li><li>Include a task to integrate assessment of the demonstrated bio-based products based on the safe and sustainable by design (SSbD) framework, developed by the European Commission, for assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials. Under this context, projects are expected to contribute with and develop recommendations that can advance further the application of the SSbD framework.</li></ul><p>Proposals should seek for links and complementarities and avoid overlaps with past, ongoing and upcoming EU funded projects, including those funded under H2020, HEU , the BBI JU and CBE JU , and the Missions 'A Soil Deal for Europe' and 'Restore our oceans and water'.

However, primary producers are often not fully integrated in bio-based value chains, and thus, benefits are not sufficiently distributed among value chain actors. In addition, actors in the bio-based economy need a specific understanding on processes optimisation and high degree of investments in innovation and technologies.</p><p>This topic addresses diverse forms of cooperation among primary producers and beyond in wider value networks as well as suitable business models to create high-value bio-based products in vertically integrated value chains via advanced biorefineries. A more efficient collaboration poses several opportunities for primary producers: a significant bargaining power as a consequence of higher production volumes, economies of scales, stronger competitiveness and better access to market, portfolio diversification in production while reducing risks and creating new economic benefits, better investment capacity due to pooling resources and control over the whole production, facilitated access to information and to new knowledge.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should:</p><ul><li>Assess the feasibility and suitability of new forms of cooperation among primary producers (e.g. cooperatives) to optimise harvesting, logistics and processing of particularly secondary or underutilised biomass for the manufacturing of innovative products in the scope of the CBE JU (including the management and recycling of waste produced during the transformation process).</li><li>Develop wider value networks, clusters, and other forms of collaboration in the bio-based sectors and stimulate the interactions between the key actors to reduce the limiting factors such as seasonality of biomass, initial costs or high market competition.</li><li>Use of technologies and logistics in a symbiotic and resource-efficient way to further accelerate the deployment of a circular and sustainable bioeconomy.</li><li>Identify and develop solutions to overcome the barriers for the valorisation of underutilised biomass, taking into account the regional conditions as well as the perspective of primary producers and the industry.</li><li>Demonstrate the economic and sustainable feasibility of the production of high added-value bio-based products with tangible market applications, thereby following the food first and the cascading use principles.</li><li>Develop economic viable long-term business plans and marketing strategies as well as other non-financial benefits (e.g. education training, technical assistance, access to new technologies and innovations, market information, etc.).

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>'Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare' </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: '<em>health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety'</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats'</em>, <em>'Climate change mitigation and adaptation'</em>, and <em>'High quality digital services for all'</em>.</p><p>Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[<sup></sup>Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated ?115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[<sup></sup>AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].</p><p>To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission's political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).</p><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 <em>'Civil security for society?</em> such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 <em>'Digital, Industry and Space?</em> such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 <em>'Food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment?</em> such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.</p><p>Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe's ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the 'Europe's Beating Cancer Plan?[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan</a>]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en</a>]]. These synergies and complementarities could be achieved, notably through mechanisms based on feedback loops, enabling on the one hand to identify policy needs that should be prioritised in research and innovation actions and facilitating on the other hand the implementation of research results into policy actions and clinical practice, thereby providing an integrated response across sectors and policy fields.</p><p><u>Expected impacts: </u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to tackling diseases and reducing disease burden, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Health burden of diseases in the EU and worldwide is reduced through effective disease management, including through the development and integration of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, personalised medicine approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care. In particular, patients are diagnosed early and accurately and receive effective, cost-efficient and affordable treatment, including patients with a rare disease, due to effective translation of research results into new diagnostic tools and therapies.</li><li>Premature mortality from non-communicable diseases is reduced by one third (by 2030), mental health and well-being is promoted, and the voluntary targets of the WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 are attained (by 2025), with an immediate impact on the related disease burden (DALYs)[[<sup></sup>WHO Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of NCDs 2013-2020 (resolution WHA66.10), <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241506236"">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241506236</a>]]<sup>,</sup>[[Including for instance the following voluntary targets (against the 2010 baseline): A 25% relative reduction in the overall mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory diseases; Halt the rise in diabetes and obesity; An 80% availability of the affordable basic technologies and essential medicines, including generics, required to treat major non-communicable diseases in both public and private facilities.]]<sup>, </sup>[[Disability-adjusted life year (DALY) is a quantitative indicator of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.]].</li><li>Health care systems benefit from strengthened research and innovation expertise, human capacities and know-how for combatting communicable and non-communicable diseases, including through international cooperation.

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing, to some of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>Public procurers, possibly in cooperation with private ones, in the area of health and care stimulate the competitive development of market-ready, environmentally sustainable innovative solutions (materials, technologies and systems/practices). These solutions take into consideration the green deal ambitions on zero pollution, climate neutrality and circular economy, while increasing the overall sustainability of the sector.</li><li>Procurers open up opportunities for European health and technology industry actors (including start-ups/SMEs) to bring to the market innovations that are cost-efficient, safe and proven to increase environmental sustainability while improving or at least maintaining health outcomes and access to care for patients.</li><li>Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of environmentally sustainable innovative solutions by their successful suppliers through providing them with first customer references for the validation and first pilot deployment.</li><li>Policymakers, health care providers and professionals, patients and carers - each in their respective areas - exchange and adopt good practices and the best solutions and technologies that the market can deliver to reduce carbon emissions and minimise waste and pollution stemming from health and care provision, in line with the Green Deal ambitions.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The healthcare sector is responsible for 4-5% of global total carbon emissions contributing significantly to Europe's carbon footprint and to the generation of large amounts of plastics and other waste, including chemical waste through the discharge of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic chemicals as well as disinfectants and antimicrobial resistant pathogens into the wastewater system. Good hygiene and safety are vital in this setting however innovative solutions can help to reduce the environmental impact of the healthcare sector through the efficient use of resources, increasing circularity, and the introduction of 'greener? materials, technologies and practices.</p><p>Up to now the healthcare sector has not significantly embraced the green transition. However, pressure is increasing as demonstrated by the launch of the first ever Declaration on Climate and Health by the UAE COP28 presidency. The declaration calls for action and joint vision on ensuring better health outcomes, in part through the transformation of health and care systems to become climate-resilient, low-carbon, sustainable, circular and equitable. Such a transformation will contribute in the long term to improving patient care by enhancing both the sustainability and overall efficiency of health and care systems.</p><p>Pre-commercial procurement (PCP) actions target consortia of procurers with similar needs that want to procure together the development of innovative solutions for greening the health and care systems. This topic does not provide direct funding to developers, industry or research organisations to perform R&amp;D. They will be able to respond to the call for tenders launched by consortia of procurers funded under this call. Specific guidance on PCP actions and minimum eligibility requirements can be found in General Annexes H of the Horizon Europe work programme.</p><p>As every step in health and care delivery has a role in reducing its environmental footprint, the topic can support any of the different dimensions and needs for the greening of the healthcare sector.</p><p>Proposals should target either:</p><ul><li>Direct and indirect footprint deriving from the provision and/or delivery of care (excluding infrastructural elements related to building, transport logistics and food footprints).</li><li>Circularity, waste production and treatment.</li><li>Footprint from the chain of suppliers in making and delivering products, or services.</li><li>More efficient use of resources, decreasing the overall sector footprint while addressing the constantly increasing demand for healthcare.</li></ul><p>Focus should be on solutions that are specific to the healthcare sector therefore proposals targeting general infrastructure (energy efficiency of buildings such cooling, heating and ventilation, vehicles, construction or refurbishment), energy supply or food and catering services do not fall within scope. Within this topic, it is possible to foresee the transfer and adaptation of solutions and/or interventions from other sectors to health and care systems. It is open both to proposals requiring improvements mainly based on one specific solution/technology field, as well as to proposals requiring end-to-end solutions that need combinations of different types of innovation.</p><p>Continuous dialogue between demand and supply side is required for the success of PCPs, therefore the effective involvement of end users (e.g. clinical teams, patients or hospital structures etc) needs to be considered in the proposal. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, procurers are required to organise an open market consultation before launching the procurement and to promote the call for tenders widely across Europe to potentially interested suppliers.</p><p>Involvement of procurement decision makers is needed to ensure that end solution(s) are adopted by health and care systems increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to purchase at least one solution resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate whether they will (1) procure the solution(s) as part of the PCP or (2) in a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP. In the first case, procurers can implement the project as a fast-track PCP (see general annex H) and foresee the budget to purchase at least one solution during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers must include in the proposal a deliverable that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase successful solution(s) after the PCP.</p> <p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2820%2930271-0"">https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2820%2930271-0</a></p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://reliefweb.int/report/world/cop28-uae-declaration-climate-and-health"">https://reliefweb.int/report/world/cop28-uae-declaration-climate-and-health</a></p>",,"<p>Calls for proposals under this destination are directed towards the Key Strategic Orientation KSO-D <em>'Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society'</em> of Horizon Europe's Strategic Plan 2021-2024.

Therefore, the transformation and modernisation of our health systems will be one of the biggest challenges in the economic recovery-bound future, but it will also be a time of opportunity for generating evidence, taking advantage of digital and data-driven innovation and developing more flexible and equitable health systems.</p><p>Under this destination, research and innovation aims at supporting health care systems in their transformation to ensure fair access to sustainable health care services of high quality for all citizens. Funded activities should support the development of innovative, feasible, implementable, financially sound and scalable solutions in the various dimensions of health care systems (e.g. governance, financing, human and physical resources, health service provision, and patient empowerment). Ultimately, these activities should improve governance and provide decision-makers with new evidence, methods, tools and technologies for uptake into their health care systems and supporting health care professionals and providers and allocating resources according to citizens' health needs and preferences, while ensuring fiscal and environmental sustainability to assure those needs can be met on the long-term. Funded activities should adopt a patient-centred approach that empowers patients, promotes a culture of dialogue and openness between citizens, patients, caregivers, health care providers and other relevant stakeholders, and unleashes the potential for social innovation.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 4 will focus on the following issues:</p><ul><li>Accelerating the development of personalised medicine in the EU and Associated Countries, especially through a public-public cofunded partnership on personalised medicine</li><li>Increasing access to health and care services for patients and citizens, and especially for people in vulnerable situations and at risk of discrimination</li><li>Improving the resilience and mental wellbeing of the health and care workforce, including informal carers</li><li>Enhancing development and uptake of research and innovation in health and care systems, including environmental transformation of the systems and contributions to the European Green Deal.</li></ul><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies.

Considerable attention is given to the mobilisation of alternative sources of proteins, fibres and carbohydrates, due to the increasing world population and the current unsustainable animal protein production systems. In addition to proteins, fibres and carbohydrates where significant advancements are under way, there is still the need to develop and validate at pilot scale breakthrough innovations in other food and feed ingredients which play an important role in human and animal health such as prebiotics, postbiotics, vitamins, peptides, oligosaccharides, fats, emulsifiers, enhancers of digestibility. In addition to those having a direct role in nutrition, other ingredients have an indirect, but nonetheless key, role in promoting healthier food and feed systems by enhancing organoleptic properties, texture, colour, palatability, digestibility etc. Unlocking this opportunity alongside with the current push to healthier and sustainable food chains makes the market of sustainable food and feed ingredients extremely promising for high tech bio-based applications.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should:</p><ul><li>Develop innovative food and/or feed ingredients from sustainably sourced bio-based feedstock. The innovation in scope can be related to i) breakthrough processes to obtain known food/feed ingredients, and/or ii) novel food/feed ingredients. Ingredients in scope include bioactive compounds, antioxidants, prebiotics, postbiotics, vitamins, peptides, oligosaccharides; fats; emulsifiers; taste, texture, palatability and digestibility enhancers; colourants, functional/'precision proteins' (i.e. proteins obtained, for example but not only, from precision fermentation process) among others. Besides the technical properties of the targeted ingredients (organoleptic, nutritional, prevention of intolerances/allergies), proposals should also consider their affordability. The production of bulk proteins, fibres and carbohydrates used as main nutritional component is not in scope per se; however the development of complex food and feed formulations involving the application of innovative functional ingredients working in synergy with them is in scope.</li><li>Any production technique is in scope; proposals are required to pay particular attention to environmental, social and economic sustainability of the chosen pathway (including ingredients' sources and availability/supply and the use of natural resources such as land, water, energy). In addition to production processes, proposals should consider downstream separation and purification processes to meet the targeted quality for final application aligned with food and safety legal requirements. Circular solutions, e.g. exploiting residual streams, are also in scope and could provide additional socio-environmental benefits.

This will ensure the EU's strategic autonomy and competitiveness for the future commercial deployment of fusion energy.</p><p>The EU has a world-leading industrial capability in mainstream magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). The know-how in the construction and assembly of tokamaks and stellarators has primarily been developed through involvement in ITER and other publicly funded devices either via F4E or EUROfusion.</p><p>However, large-size EU industries have been mainly involved as suppliers rather than R&amp;D partners. There is also a significant risk that the engineering fusion know-how and industrial potential could be lost and migrate to other countries with a more favourable economic and regulatory landscape.</p><p>In this context, the Commission aims to engage the EU fusion industry to tackle the critical bottlenecks that need to be addressed to design a first viable and cost-effective fusion power plant. This will ensure that EU industry masters and exploits the relevant technologies and consolidates the range of components and processes needed to establish a competitive EU value supply chain, also in connection to the completion of ITER construction and its operation. At the same time, in addition to the current mainstream MCF approach, the Commission intends to support innovation in alternative fusion concepts and in the development of key enabling technologies to address specific technical and industrial challenges.</p><p>Fusion is one of the most ambitious engineering feats and will require the integration of knowledge and expertise from several different fields and stakeholders. Neither the public nor the private sector acting alone will be able to successfully tackle this challenge. For this reason, it is necessary to create a new collaborative environment in the form of a PPP.</p><p>This action will provide key support to a representative stakeholder consortium. This consortium will act as a single-entry point managing activities towards the development of a potential future PPP. The action will, in particular:</p><ul><li>identify and create, in an inclusive manner, a stakeholder network bringing together industry (including supply chain, startups, energy providers and investors), technology centres, academia and research organisations (including EUROfusion and the Joint Undertaking 'Fusion for Energy');</li><li>support the creation of an organisation (entity with legal personality) which is expected to become the lead organisation in the potential future PPP;</li><li>put in place the legal and financial arrangements required to ensure the sustainability of this organisation beyond the duration of this action and throughout the duration of the PPP, with a view to the organisation possibly evolving into a long-term European Technology and Innovation Platform in the field of fusion, integrating wider R&amp;I efforts across the EU;</li><li>define a suitable governance structure for the PPP in the form of a co-programmed European partnership;</li><li>develop a Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Fusion Energy in coordination with the Commission, industry and the EU fusion community;</li><li>coordinate and leverage commitments, expected in the form of in-kind contributions, from the private partners;</li><li>undertake preparatory work for the possible establishment of a separate trade association representing the EU fusion industry.</li></ul><p>Among the objectives mentioned above, priority should be given to those required to launch the PPP within the period covered by the extension of the Euratom Research and Training Programme (2026-2027), subject to the Council's adoption of a Regulation on this extension.</p><p>The duration of the action is expected to be 2 years.</p>",,,,,

The partnership will be firmly anchored within the framework of the European Health Union package that aims to improve the EU's capacity in the vital areas of prevention, preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, early warning, and response. In this regard, synergies and close collaboration with the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) and other relevant European Commission services need to be ensured.</p><p>The partnership's activities are expected to be key enablers of the EU Global Health Strategy, notably its guiding principle 5 to boost global health research and guiding principle 7 to strengthen capacities for prevention, preparedness and response, particularly to expand and strengthen European and global research partnerships including clinical trial networks that can be pivoted to address new and emerging pathogens.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards, and contributing to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>The EU offers a valued network of clinical trial sites that have the capacity to implement well-coordinated large-scale multi-country quality trials in different target populations, which are able to smoothly transition to public health interventions relevant for cross-border health threats in response to a public health emergency;</li><li>Relevant EU and national entities, the scientific communities and networks, policymakers and funders enhance their collaboration and coordination for strengthened research on pandemic preparedness and response, forming a strong and structured ecosystem with shared evidence, tools and methodologies cutting across sectors;</li><li>Research funders, policymakers, relevant EU and national entities, and the research community recognise and close rapidly relevant research and related infrastructure gaps and break existing silos on pandemic preparedness research and response;</li><li>Healthcare authorities, regulatory authorities, policymakers and other stakeholders use the research results to develop evidence-based strategies and policies for pandemic preparedness and response, and deploy good practices to European countries and regions, and beyond whenever relevant;</li><li>The research community at large benefits from and uses an improved comprehensive knowledge framework integrating the EU, national/regional data and information infrastructures to improve transnational research in the area of pandemic preparedness and response;</li><li>The EU is strengthened as an internationally recognised actor for pandemic preparedness research and response, as such substantially contributing to global cooperation and coordination.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The COVID-19 pandemic uncovered the challenges that European health care systems face in detecting, preventing, combatting and managing outbreaks of infectious diseases in a coordinated manner. It also illustrated the need for stronger preparedness and networks for research and timely clinical trials and observational studies, for more timely availability of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as more appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions and adequate communication strategies in terms of fighting mis/disinformation and fostering appropriate behaviours. Furthermore, it showed how unilateral research initiatives may lead to a fragmented, inefficient research landscape.</p><p>At the same time, the relentless work of the research community that has led to availability of several COVID-19 vaccines in record time highlighted the critical importance of collaborative R&amp;I to respond rapidly to emerging health threats.</p><p>Therefore, transformative investments in research for pandemic preparedness are needed at European level. Stronger collaboration and coordination between European actors, including the appropriate infrastructures and networks, are an important prerequisite for improving EU's pandemic preparedness and stepping up our contribution to global cooperation in this area.</p><p>This should be done through a partnership that promotes:</p><ul><li>improved coordination and cooperation to adjust research and innovation agendas on national and European levels (and contributing globally), as essential part of the pandemic preparedness planning and implementation activities;</li><li>coordination and prioritisation of a comprehensive research response to a health emergency, from basic research for better understanding of pathogens with pandemic potential to the development or adaptation of medical countermeasures, as well as effective non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and/or public health and social measures (PHSM), and using an integrated One Health approach;</li><li>the consolidation and further development of ever-warm EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, controlled trials and observational studies for public health interventions, such as EU-wide vaccine and treatment trials, PHSM/NPI trials or cohorts;</li><li>the provision of robust and timely scientific evidence to inform sound public health decision-making in response to a public health emergency;</li><li>the use of agreed data standards to safely collect, store, link and manage FAIR data and to exploit the full potential of the generated data for modelling and in-silico methods for epidemic surveillance, clinical trials and observational studies, among others.</li></ul><p>The partnership should strengthen the European Research Area by supporting excellence in innovative research, capacity building, programmes for development of talent, widening the engagement of countries and sectors not yet involved.</p><p>The partnership should endorse a pandemic preparedness Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA) based on the work of the CSA BE READY and prepare for the management of the research response during a crisis, by strengthening the collaboration between relevant partners and the alignment of related investments. The partnership will consider the impact of environmental, climatic issues and patterns in relation with the emergence and spread of health threats to better understand how these increase the risk for emerging infectious diseases, and how this should be integrated into the research done using a One Health approach.</p><p>The scope of the partnership should encompass:</p><ul><li><strong>basic research</strong> to accelerate the acquisition of knowledge on the biology of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, their transmission and interaction with humans, animals and plants, in particular in view of emerging threats to human health. The initial focus should be on pathogens with high epidemic or pandemic potential for the EU, such as those included in the list of priority diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO), with particular attention to those meeting the criteria identified by HERA;</li><li><strong>preclinical research</strong> aimed at better understanding of human diseases caused by pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential and testing of related medical countermeasures;</li><li><strong>clinical research</strong> to support the generation of novel solutions, in particular the development (phase I to phase III) of medical countermeasures, e.g. vaccines, diagnostics, therapeutics and digital solutions, to prevent or mitigate outbreaks from pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, in line with the mission of HERA and the ACT EU initiative;</li><li>a <strong>key feature</strong> should be the consolidation and further development of an <strong>ever-warm network of clinical trial sites</strong> applying the same quality standards and ensuring a baseline of continuous clinical trial activity across a wide and diverse range of clinical trial sites, to allow for a rapid clinical trial response in case of an epidemic or pandemic. This includes the development of criteria for a clinical trial site to be considered as ever-warm;</li><li>the development, testing and validation of new methods and tools, including those based on artificial intelligence and computer modelling, to improve <strong>surveillance and diagnosis </strong>and control of the spread of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential;</li><li>the conduct of <strong>public health and social sciences and humanities (SSH) research</strong> for the development and robust evaluation of appropriate non-pharmaceutical interventions/public health and social measures and effective communication strategies at all phases of a public health emergency;</li><li>the <strong>consolidation and/or development of infrastructures, platforms and networks</strong> necessary for fast and timely start of the response research, capitalising on previous investments and existing infrastructures supporting collaboration, trans-boundary access and provision of services, such as provided by ISIDORe or ECRIN.</li><li><strong>capacity building</strong> through <strong>networking and training of researchers</strong>, to share knowledge and good practices also with EU and national entities, policymakers and funders.</li></ul><p>It is intended to implement the partnership in two phases. The activities in the first phase should mainly focus on:</p><ul><li>the way clinical trials are set up and conducted in the EU to address public health emergencies, including new approaches such as computer modelling and in-silico clinical trials. <ul><li>this will require coordination mechanisms to support prioritisation of emergency trials, improved mechanisms to identify and rank promising compounds, mobilising EU and Member State funding mechanisms, and measures to help speed up contracting of clinical trial sites during emergencies and in preparedness time. For this purpose, close collaboration with the EMA and its Emergency Task Force, National Competent Authorities, Ethics Committees, and the European Commission should be ensured.</li><li>this includes the consolidation, integration and further expansion of EU-wide network of ever-warm clinical trial sites, building on earlier made investments such as Vaccelerate, Ecraid and EU RESPONSE. It is expected that the partnership will develop a sustainable solution to ensure the long-term viability of adequate European clinical trial networks for a timely public health emergency response, which cover key target populations and have a suitable geographic spread.</li> </ul></li><li>implementing joint calls for transnational proposals to foster transnational research in the other areas in the scope of the partnership.</li><li>developing the roadmaps for the implementation of the remaining activities foreseen by the partnership.</li></ul><p>The second phase of the partnership is expected to build on this first phase, to further develop and consolidate what has been achieved and implement the roadmaps developed for remaining activities as outlined in the scope, with the possibility of expanding to new partners.</p><p>The total indicative budget for the partnership is up to EUR 100 million and subject to the effective implementation of the commitments made by the members of the consortium. The Commission envisages to include new actions in its future work programmes to provide continued support to the partnership for the duration of Horizon Europe.</p><p>The expected duration of the partnership is 7 to 10 years with the first phase having a duration of 2 to 3 years.</p><p><strong>General principles</strong></p><p>As <strong>general principles</strong>, the partnership will:</p><ul><li>promote an inclusive membership and balanced geographic representation, open to third countries and other relevant stakeholders;</li><li>promote data sharing, data standards and data-based digital tools, and align with EU-wide initiatives on <strong>open access and FAIR</strong><strong> data, artificial intelligence and virtual human twins</strong>;</li><li>pay specific attention to the <strong>gender and sex dimensions</strong>, as well as representativeness of different population groups including young people and vulnerable groups;</li><li>foster the development and use of <strong>trustworthy artificial intelligence</strong>, in all its three dimensions (lawful, ethical and robust);</li><li>ensure <strong>synergies</strong> and explore <strong>collaborations</strong> with other relevant activities at EU and international level.</li></ul><p>To ensure coherence and complementarity of activities and leverage knowledge and investment possibilities, the partnership is expected to establish relevant collaborations with the relevant European Commission services, with other Horizon Europe projects, partnerships (institutionalised and co-funded) and missions as set out in the working document on 'Coherence and Synergies of candidate European partnerships under Horizon Europe' as well as to explore collaborations with other relevant activities at EU and international level. On top of this, the proposal should consider synergies with EU programmes, including but not limited to EU4Health, the Digital Europe Programme (DIGITAL), the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), InvestEU, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) and the Technical Support Instrument (TSI).</p><p>When defining calls for proposals, the partnership needs to consider the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>The partnership should create synergies with the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) currently in its third iteration as Global Health EDCTP3 Joint Undertaking, that brings together 15 countries from Europe and 25 countries from sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP is already funding adaptive clinical trial networks spanning African and European countries and a Clinical Trials Community Network The partnership should also contribute to help achieve the goals of GloPID-R, the coalition of research funders that invests in research to improve pandemic preparedness &amp; response.</p><p>The partnership is open to all EU Member States, as well as to countries associated to Horizon Europe and will remain open to third countries wishing to join. Applicants should describe in their proposal the methodology for their collaboration and the aims they want to achieve with this kind of collaboration. Cooperation with international organisations, private sector and non-European institutions and experts may be considered.</p><p><strong>Governance</strong></p><p>The partnership's governance structure should enable an upfront strategic steering, effective management and coordination, daily implementation of activities and ensure the use and uptake of the results. The governance should involve key stakeholders and interested parties, including but not limited to the research and innovation community, public health authorities, patients and citizens, health and care professionals, formal and informal care organisations, innovation owners, and relevant EU entities, including the European Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency.</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>The proposal should pool the necessary cash and in-kind resources from the participating national (or regional) research programmes, in order to:</p><ul><li>sustain and further develop the EU-wide networks and infrastructures for clinical research, and in particular a network of ever-warm clinical trial sites by running continuous preparedness trials in relevant target populations;</li><li>implement joint calls for transnational proposals resulting in grants to third parties. Financial support provided by the participants to third parties is one of the activities of this action in order to be able to achieve its objectives;</li><li>conduct capacity building activities;</li><li>implement any other activities, coordinated between (a group of) partnership members, that contribute to the achievement of the partnership's objectives.

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>'Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare' </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: '<em>health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety'</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats'</em>, <em>'Climate change mitigation and adaptation'</em>, and <em>'High quality digital services for all'</em>.</p><p>Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[<sup></sup>Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated ?115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[<sup></sup>AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].</p><p>To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission's political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).</p><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 <em>'Civil security for society?</em> such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 <em>'Digital, Industry and Space?</em> such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 <em>'Food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment?</em> such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.</p><p>Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe's ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the 'Europe's Beating Cancer Plan?[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan</a>]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en</a>]].

To that end, proposals under this topic should aim for delivering results that are directed, tailored towards and contributing to some of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>Health care practitioners and providers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and/or those in high-income countries (HICs) serving disadvantaged populations have access to and use specific guidelines to implement health interventions that improve the availability of effective, equitable, efficient, integrated, patient-centred, safe, and timely care and the overall quality of life for people living with multiple long-term conditions including non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</li><li>Public health managers and authorities, including from other relevant sector (e. g., social, culture) have access to improved insights and evidence on how to decrease the fragmentation of care for patients living with multiple chronic conditions, and ensure continuity of care across all stages of disease progression. They use this knowledge to design policies to reduce health inequities.</li><li>Adopting an implementation science approach to studying interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs, researchers, clinicians and authorities have an improved understanding how the proposed interventions could be adopted in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations of HICs setting, taking into account specific social, political, economic and cultural contexts.</li><li>Communities and local stakeholders and authorities are fully engaged in implementing and taking up interventions for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs and thus contribute to deliver better health.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The European Commission is a member of the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases (GACD), an alliance of international funding agencies representing over 80% of the world's public health research funding and the first collaboration of its kind to specifically address NCDs. The GACD supports implementation science to improve health outcomes. This topic is launched in concertation with the other GACD members and aligned with the 9<sup>th</sup> GACD call.</p><p>The topic is focused on implementation research for management of multiple long-term conditions in the context of NCDs (MLTC NCD) in LMICs and/or disadvantaged populations in HICs. Proposals should focus on implementation science around interventions that will generate evidence about when, for whom, and under what circumstances, patient-centred approaches can improve integrated care for patients with MLTC NCD.</p><p>MLTC NCD refers to the co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions, at least one of which is an NCD. NCDs include for example cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, hypertension, haematological disorders, sleep disorders, and mental health disorders. The high prevalence of MLTC NCD is projected to rise with the ageing population and the increasing burden of NCDs. MLTC NCD has a profound impact on patients, and is associated with premature death, physical disability, substance abuse, poor quality of life, mental health issues, and financial difficulties from high costs of care. It is also associated with difficulties in adherence to and high rates of adverse effects from treatment with multiple medications. In addition, due to poor health and the complexity of managing their conditions, patients with MLTC NCD are high utilisers of health care systems, which is especially challenging in low-resourced contexts.</p><p>Addressing MLTC NCD demands a shift from fragmented models of care, which treat individual health issues separately as they occur, to a more holistic integrated care model that provides a whole person focus on health management. The current evidence suggests that primary healthcare, integrated and coordinated care, patient-centred interventions, digital health technology, and optimised medication therapy are key to improved management of MLTC NCD. However, implementing patient-centred strategies for treating MLTC NCD remains challenging and largely unexplored in disadvantaged contexts, especially in LMICs. Adapting and scaling such models is critical to improving quality of life; reducing disability; reducing the burden of caretaking on (typically female) family members and reducing health system costs.</p><p>The proposed implementation research must focus on one or more evidence-based interventions (or complex interventions) known to promote integrated management of multiple long-term conditions, including NCDs. It should assess patient-centred interventions focused on patient management or self-management, or interventions that transform communities, clinical practice, and/or health systems. Applicants should justify the choice of intervention(s) and provide evidence of the intervention's effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and potential for long-term health and other impacts. Ideally, evidence of the intervention's real-world effectiveness should be supported by a well-conducted systematic review where available. As the evidence for how to manage MLTC NCD is still emerging, particularly in LMICs, a limited period of testing the effectiveness of an intervention that the applicant's team has adapted for local implementation is therefore usually appropriate.</p><p>Applicants must explore the implementation of proposed intervention(s) for a selected study population(s) taking into account the unique social, political, economic, and cultural context(s) in which the study will take place. Applicants should justify why any adaptation will not compromise the known effectiveness of the selected intervention(s).</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following activities:</p><ul><li>Provide a research plan using validated implementation research frameworks or hybrid design research;</li><li>Have an appropriate strategy for measuring implementation research outcomes and real-world effectiveness outcomes and indicators;</li><li>Specifically address health equity and the principles of Universal Health Coverage;</li><li>Engage an appropriately expert and skilled research team which can ensure a suitable multidisciplinary approach and that demonstrates equitable partnership and shared leadership between HIC-LMIC, and/or non-Indigenous-Indigenous members of the project team and external stakeholders through a clear governance strategy;</li><li>Provide a stakeholder engagement strategy with evidence of support/engagement from key stakeholders for delivering patient-centred care and a pathway to sustain the proposed intervention after the funding ends;</li><li>Provide opportunities for implementation research capacity building for early career researchers and team members from lower resourced environments, such as LMICs or disadvantaged communities.</li><li>Ensure meaningful involvement of early career team members, including at least one early career member as a co-investigator.</li></ul><p>Applicants are also encouraged to follow a life course approach, adapting the intervention to one or more key life stage(s) critical for reducing the onset or progression of MLTC NCD, and to explore how to best implement digital technology interventions.</p><p>The study population may include patients with existing MLTC NCD, or existing NCDs (e.g., studies focusing on rolling out screening services for multiple NCDs). The study population may also include patients with chronic infectious disease(s) (e.g., studies that focus on integrating NCD management into an HIV or tuberculosis clinic) or a mixture of both.</p><p>The following are potential interventions or strategies that applicants may consider in their implementation plan (please note that this is not an exhaustive list):</p><ul><li>Strategies for improving MLTC NCD identification, stratification/staging, management, and/or monitoring such as investigating strategies for adapting and implementing the protocol(s) described in the WHO Package of Essential NCD Interventions (WHO PEN) that address MLTC NCD management. For example, projects may focus on integrating NCD care into clinics that typically focus on the management of infectious diseases, such as HIV or tuberculosis clinics, or the integration of NCD care into maternal and child health clinics;</li><li>Strategies to streamline and improve quality of care among individuals with MLTC NCD to reduce fragmentation of services, including task-sharing and/or the use of clinical decision-making tools (e.g., digital tools);</li><li>Strategies and/or tools (e.g., digital tools) that optimise appropriate medication and (non-pharmacological) therapeutic prescribing, adherence, and/or reduced drug interactions/ adverse effects;</li><li>Interventions that improve transitions through the health system, from community to primary to tertiary care and beyond, such as to home care or hospice;</li><li>Health behavioural change interventions that target different risk factor clusters (e.g., exercise, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse).</li></ul><p>The proposal's primary outcome measures must be implementation research outcomes to assess MLTC NCD. With regard to MLTC NCD, applicants are encouraged to explore any combination of chronic conditions, including mental health disorders and sleep disorders. The specific combination of conditions should be justified using local or regional epidemiological data about their co-occurrence. Outcome measures should appropriately address implementation tackling MLTC NCD, and not focus on one condition. Proposals may also contain a strategy for measuring other secondary outcomes (or proxy outcomes) that demonstrate the intervention's real-world effectiveness in the local context and target populations. Additionally, other health or non-health outcome measures, especially those identified as important by patient participants and/or critical for advancing Universal Health Coverage, are also welcome.</p><p>Poverty, racism, ethnic discrimination, and other inequities are directly associated with reduced potential for equitable access to quality care. Proposals should consider the social determinants of health and discuss their potential impact on the effective implementation of the intervention(s). If there is a focus on a particular population (e.g., gender, ethnicity), then the reason for this should be justified.</p><p>In order to promote health equity, proposals should aim to address differences in intervention access, uptake, and effectiveness in socially disadvantaged groups and develop strategies for reducing inequities. To facilitate this process at the data analysis stage, studies should be designed to address such differences. At a minimum, studies should capture sex and/or gender differences. If feasible, a plan for capturing intersectional impacts on health outcomes should be included in the analysis strategy.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>For implementation research to have a strong likelihood of being taken up into policy or practice and informing the scale up of effective interventions, it is vital that project teams engage the appropriate stakeholders. Proposals should present a strategy to include the relevant decision makers such as policymakers, ministry officials, local authorities, non-governmental organisation leaders, community leaders as well as other stakeholders such as community groups, or other individuals or organizations involved in the implementation of the intervention, from the development to the implementation knowledge translation phase. It is also important to include stakeholders who can help sustain the project's implementation, facilitate scale up, and use the knowledge generated from the project after the grant ends.</p><p>Stakeholders also include patients, their family members and carers. Their contributions should be nurtured through meaningful engagement from the outset, not only as participants in the research undertaken. Patient engagement throughout the research project is critical to developing patient-centred models of care.</p><p>All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and joint activities, including internationally, as appropriate. These activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the Annual Scientific Meetings of the GACD, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Therefore, proposals are expected to include a budget for such activities and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase.</p><p>Applicants envisaging to include clinical studies should provide details of their clinical studies in the dedicated annex using the template provided in the submission system.

Research and innovation supported under this destination should contribute to the impact area <em>'Good health and high-quality accessible healthcare' </em>and in particular to the following expected impact, set out in the Strategic Plan for the health cluster: '<em>health care providers are able to better tackle and manage diseases (infectious diseases, including poverty-related and neglected diseases, non-communicable and rare diseases) and reduce the disease burden on patients effectively thanks to better understanding and treatment of diseases, more effective and innovative health technologies, better ability and preparedness to manage epidemic outbreaks and improved patient safety'</em>. In addition, research and innovation supported under this destination could also contribute to the following impact areas: <em>'A resilient EU prepared for emerging threats'</em>, <em>'Climate change mitigation and adaptation'</em>, and <em>'High quality digital services for all'</em>.</p><p>Communicable and non-communicable diseases cause the greatest amounts of premature death and disability in the EU and worldwide. They pose a major health, societal and economic threat and burden. Many people are still suffering from these diseases and too often dying prematurely. Non-communicable diseases, including mental illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases, are responsible for up to 80% of EU health care costs[[<sup></sup>Currently, around 50 million people in the EU are estimated to suffer from two or more chronic conditions, and most of these people are over 65. Every day, 22 500 people die in Europe from those diseases, counting of 87% of all deaths. They account for 550 000 premature deaths of people of working age with an estimated ?115 billion economic loss per year (0.8% of GDP).]]. These costs are spent on the treatment of such diseases that to a large extent are preventable. Furthermore, only around 3% of the health care budgets are currently spent on preventive measures although there is a huge potential for prevention. Infectious diseases, including emerging infectious diseases and infections resistant to antimicrobials, remain a major threat to public health in the EU but also to global health security. Deaths caused by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could exceed 10 million per year worldwide according to some predictions[[<sup></sup>AMR is estimated to be responsible for 25 000 deaths per year in the EU alone and 700 000 deaths per year globally. It has been estimated that AMR might cause more deaths than cancer by 2050.]].</p><p>To further advance, there is an urgent need for research and innovation to develop new preparedness and prevention measures, public health interventions, diagnostics, vaccines, therapies, alternatives to antimicrobials, as well as to improve existing preparedness and prevention strategies to create tangible impacts, taking into account sex/gender-related issues. This will require international cooperation to pool the best expertise and know-how available worldwide, to access world-class research infrastructures and to leverage critical scales of investments on priority needs through a better alignment with other funders of international cooperation in health research and innovation. The continuation of international partnerships and cooperation with international organisations is particularly needed to combat infectious diseases, to address antimicrobial resistances, to respond to major unmet medical needs for global health security, including the global burden of non-communicable diseases, and to strengthen patient safety.</p><p>In this work programme, destination 3 will focus on major societal challenges linked to the Commission's political priorities such as the fight against cancer and other non-communicable diseases, better diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases, preparedness and response to and surveillance of health threats and epidemics, reduction of the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections, improving vaccination rates, demographic change, mental health and digital empowerment in health literacy. In particular, the topics under this destination will support activities aiming at: i) better understanding of diseases, their drivers and consequences, including pain and the causative links between health determinants and diseases, and better evidence-base for policymaking; ii) better methodologies and diagnostics that allow timely and accurate diagnosis, identification of personalised treatment options and assessment of health outcomes, including for patients with a rare disease; iii) development and validation of effective intervention for better surveillance, prevention, detection, treatment and crisis management of infectious disease threats; iv) innovative health technologies developed and tested in clinical practice, including personalised medicine approaches and use of digital tools to optimise clinical workflows; v) new and advanced therapies for non-communicable diseases, including rare diseases developed in particular for those without approved options, supported by strategies to make them affordable for the public payer; and vi) scientific evidence for improved/tailored policies and legal frameworks and to inform major policy initiatives at global level (e.g. WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control; UNEA Pollution Implementation Plan).</p><p>In view of increasing the impact of EU investments under Horizon Europe, the European Commission welcomes and supports cooperation between EU-funded projects to enable cross-fertilisation and other synergies. This could range from networking to joint activities such as the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. Opportunities for potential synergies exist between projects funded under the same topic but also between other projects funded under another topic, cluster or pillar of Horizon Europe (but also with ongoing projects funded under Horizon 2020). In particular, this could involve projects related to European health research infrastructures (under pillar I of Horizon Europe), the EIC strategic challenges on health and EIT-KIC Health (under pillar III of Horizon Europe), or in areas cutting across the health and other clusters (under pillar II of Horizon Europe). For instance, with cluster 3 <em>'Civil security for society?</em> such as on health security/emergencies (preparedness and response, medical countermeasures, epidemic outbreaks/pandemics, natural disasters and technological incidents, bioterrorism); with cluster 4 <em>'Digital, Industry and Space?</em> such as on decision-support systems or on geo-observation and monitoring (e.g. of disease vectors, epidemics); or with cluster 6 <em>'Food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment?</em> such as on health security and AMR (one-health: human/animal/plant/soil/water health). In addition, while focusing on civilian applications, there may be there may be synergies with actions conducted under the European Defence Fund, notably in the field of defence medical countermeasures.</p><p>Based on needs that emerged during the management of COVID-19, some research and innovation actions under Destination 3 should support the mission of the European Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) to strengthen Europe's ability to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to cross-border health emergencies by ensuring the availability and access to key medical countermeasures. Other actions should deliver relevant complementary inputs to the 'Europe's Beating Cancer Plan?[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12154-Europe-s-Beating-Cancer-Plan</a>]] in order to cover the entire cancer care pathway, including prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, cancer data monitoring, as well as quality of life of cancer patients and survivors. Furthermore, synergies and complementarities will be sought between Destination 3 and the implementation of the EU4Health Programme (2021-2027)[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/health/funding/eu4health_en</a>]].

Mission Adaptation to Climate Change assessment report</em>?.</p><p>Proposals are expected to contribute to <strong>all of</strong> the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>The project serves information and offers <strong>the latest available solutions</strong> on adaptation to climate change to regional and local authorities, namely via a number of multilingual communications products, services and activities. It does so by closely cooperating with and under the umbrella of the Mission Implementation Platform, which continues to be stakeholders' main contact point to engage with Adaptation Mission.</li><li>Knowledge and understanding of the policy implications of adaptation solutions is increasingly utilised in the policy cycles at EU, national, and regional and local levels.</li><li>The wide range of solutions tested and deployed in the context of the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change and the good practices emerged in its Community of Practice are harvested, analysed and systematised to support the implementation of the Mission.</li><li>The Mission actors (i.e., Secretariat and regions and local authorities participating in the Adaptation Mission) get comprehensive and structured information on available solutions identified, developed, tested, and deployed via relevant funding programmes and at various level of governance. Such comprehensive and structured information is also shared with the 'National Adaptation Hubs? created by HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-02, in cooperation and coordination with the Mission Implementation Platform.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Regional, local authorities are the target group of the proposed activities and the customers of the in-depth knowledge provision on solutions; as such they are not expected to participate as part of the consortium, but they should receive tailor made services from the project funded by this action, which should primarily use the Mission Implementation Platform's channels to feed them with new information products, also based on the needs (already) expressed by them (e.g. see Analysis of information provided by the signatories of the charter of the Mission Adaptation to Climate Change when adhering to the Charter).</p><p>It is expected that the project will have a duration of about 2 years.</p><p>The proposal should address <strong>all of</strong> the following aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Support and closely cooperate with the ongoing Mission Implementation Platform</strong>, in close contact with the Mission's Secretariat, to avoid duplications and by structurally analysing and summarising the good practices shared and discussed by regions and local authorities in the context of the Mission Implementation Platform's Community of Practice, both as part of Community of Practice's events and as part of the online discussion in the Mission Portal's restricted webpages. Moreover, where possible, the project will seek to use existing channels to serve information products to Mission's regions and local authorities so as to avoid duplications, namely using those established by the Mission Implementation Platform and in the Mission Portal.</li><li><strong>Seek cooperation with existing platforms and initiatives </strong>fostering climate adaptation in EU Member States and Associated Countries (in particular the Mission Portal hosted by the European Environment Agency, the NCP4missions and the TRAMI projects or followers). This is to avoid duplication of efforts and make sure Mission's regions and local authorities have easy access to such information and communications products. In particular, any communications action should be integrated as much as possible into the existing Mission portal, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency. Moreover, particular attention should also be given to make appropriate links with the Joint Research Centre's Risk Data Hub, if relevant.</p></li><li><strong>Produce a detailed inventory of adaptation solutions</strong>, in coordination with the Mission Implementation Platform, in which each solution should be classified according to how it could help to address the needs of the biogeographical zones or most recurring climate risks. The results of such an inventory should be made available, also leveraging the Mission Implementation Platform, to all local, regional and national players, so to facilitate their access to all scientific available previous knowledge. The solutions should be analysed, and their inventory structured in line with the Mission Implementation Plan's approach (in particular, adopting a priority scope along the Plan's 'key community systems and enabling conditions?) in view of ensuring maximum coherence. These solutions should also be proactively promoted with the regions and local authorities participating in the Adaptation Mission.</li><li>Local, regional and even national players who have already financed and/or experimented with solutions may also need to be given the opportunity to <strong>'publicize? effective solutions</strong><strong>that can be scaled up or replicated elsewhere.</strong></li><li>Give particular attention to <strong>available solutions at National, regional and local levels, </strong>including those of cross-border nature. As the current scope and support by the Mission Implementation Platform to the Community of Practice is limited in terms of number of regions and local authorities involved, the proposal should also identify and analyse available solutions in regions that are not directly involved with the Mission's Community of Practice - and in turn feed those to the Community of Practice discussions. To retrieve such information, the project funded under this topic is expected to closely cooperate with the project stemming from the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-02 and the different projects in the Adaptation Mission Portfolio. It should closely build on solutions identified or discussed along the multi-level governance axis (also defined as 'National hubs?), in turn supporting it with hands-on knowledge products that can be disseminated within its own structures. This cooperation will also be key to ensure that information-sharing targeting the regions and the local authorities is also tailored to the specific National governance context, to maximize its impacts and provide a basis for transforming information-sharing into building up know-how and skills.</li><li>The proposals should identify and harvest knowledge and solutions from relevant Horizon Europe projects, with particular attention to projects funded by the Adaptation Mission calls (including demonstrators) and projects identified as 'mission-relevant' in other EU funding programme (e.g., LIFE, Interreg) or legacy projects from Horizon2020 or FP7, as well as from partnerships, and from the other EU Missions, in particular the cities, soil and ocean missions. The proposals should also build on previous analyses or information already harvested by mission-relevant projects, in particular past and ongoing coordination and support actions (including but not limited to Regilience, NetworkNaturePlus, MAIA, MAGICA). This is to avoid duplications of efforts and to improve the overall understanding of the wide range of solutions available to regions and local authorities.</li><li>As the scope of the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change goes beyond Horizon Europe, the proposal should also structurally consider solutions identified, developed, tested, and deployed via other relevant funding programmes (in particular the EU cohesion policy incl. ERDF, INTERREG, as well as LIFE Programme, the Digital Europe Programme, etc.), initiatives (including Cohesion4Transitions, etc.), and actors (JRC, EIB, EBRD, etc.). Moreover, the scope should not be limited to EU programmes and initiatives only, but rather look at National and regional opportunities as well (funding programmes, national or regional hubs or initiatives, including the potential of relevant business-led or private initiatives).</li><li>Develop multilingual operational information and communication products aiming at facilitating regions and local authorities' understanding of the said solutions and their effectiveness, through a dedicated communications strategy tailored to the different target audiences within the regions and local authorities (in particular policy makers, practitioners and social partners). The proposals should also provide tools to support the authorities in the development and implementation of such solutions in their regional and local contexts (i.e., know-how).</li><li>When bringing available solutions to the knowledge of the regions and of the local authorities, the proposal should also include a dedicated task aiming at feeding the EU policy cycle <strong>by identifying good practices that merit particular attention by EU policymakers</strong> in view of strengthening policy innovation in coming cycles (feedback to policy task).</li></ul> <p>COM(2023) 457 final: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/com_2023_457_1_en_act_part1.pdf"">com_2023_457_1_en_act_part1.pdf (europa.eu)</a></p><p>https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/52e75b81-537f-11ee-9220-01aa75ed71a1/language-en</p><p>Currently managed by MIP4Adapt under the contract CINEA/2022/OP/0013/SI2.884597 funded by the European Union.

Economic consequences pertain on one hand to health care utilisation and health care spending, OA is however also associated with relevant economic impact on the individual due to missed days at work, early retirement, and substantial out-of-pocket expenditures. Since OA primarily affects the elderly, females, patients with lower levels of education and socio-economic status and certain ethnicities, the associated economic risk hits already vulnerable populations. OA has long been underestimated in its impact; the disease negatively affects social functioning and ranks 7th for years lived with disability in people over 70 years. With its impact on activities of daily living, OA is a major risk factor for loss of independence. Additionally, OA is associated with increased mortality.</p><p>Despite major research efforts and increasing insights into the mechanism, epidemiology, risk factors and natural history of OA, various development efforts over the years have failed to provide a disease-modifying treatment. The epidemiology as well as clinical and biological insights strongly suggest the existence of several pheno- and endotypes of osteoarthritis; failure to account for those differences critically hampers progress in the field. The implementation of innovative approaches to stratify the patient population, predict the course of disease and define patient-relevant endpoints is specifically relevant in an ageing society with a high prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and multi-morbidity. Furthermore, there is an increasing prevalence of post-traumatic secondary OA in relatively young individuals affected at the prime of their lives. First studies towards the clustering of patient groups and development of predictive models have been published suggesting the feasibility of these approaches. Bringing all those insights together requires the collaboration of experts from various fields and can only be achieved in the concerted action of a public-private partnership, including existing initiatives.</p><p>The overall aim of this topic is to build a public-private partnership that is able to integrate and leverage the plethora of existing and currently collected data on OA, as well as the increasing insights and expertise gathered over decades of research. Further, the goal is to use a data driven approach to significantly progress the field by leveraging the novel opportunities that have emerged thanks to increased computing power and innovative methodologies in big data analysis, in order to:</p><ol> <li>integrate different perspectives to improve the understanding of osteoarthritis as a complex disease;</li><li>foster progress towards regulatory validation of patient-relevant endpoints to measure and predict OA disease progression as well as alternative endpoints to measure response to treatment;</li><li>allow predictive modelling while actively seeking feedback to incorporate the perception of patients, care givers, primary care physicians and regulators.</li></ol><p>The action generated by this topic should pave the way towards transforming the current isolated research efforts and static late-stage development approaches into a more patient-centred and simplified (more inclusive/enriched patient population, shorter study duration, potential enablement of the evaluation of preventive or early therapeutic strategies based on predicted outcomes, cost-effectiveness etc.) as well as sustainable part of clinical research and development. This aim is supported by increasing the insights into OA as an heterogenous disease with various underlying patient risk profiles, patho-mechanistic pathways and underlying genotypic/epigenetic/ metabolomic/transcriptomic phenomena based on big data.

As a very large number of localities are indeed small or medium in size, with large and rural territories, their lack of preparedness translates in a crucial weakness of the overall continent preparedness and response to the changing climate. The shortage of skilled labour and in particular of experts with climate assessment and environmental skills prevent a majority of municipalities from implementing local investments.</p><p>This capacity limitation, coupled with the typical large territorial responsibility of the involved authorities and the very diverse risks they are exposed, makes in many cases difficult to leverage efficiencies of scale as it is the case in more densely populated areas. This has unluckily translated in many cases into more deadly impacts of extreme weathers events in relation to the population exposed.</p><p>Proposals should identify approaches and innovative solutions leading to an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change which are particularly suitable for implementation by small and medium local authorities and the rural context. These solutions could include technological, social and business-related aspects or a combination of those. Nature-based solutions should be explored as priority and be at the very heart of the development whenever possible. Moreover, particular attention should be given to the potential of digital solutions in a rural or small/medium size population entity context, to also support their twin digital transition. Opportunities of circular economy to increase resilience and reduce dependencies should be seized.</p><p>The proposed solutions should specifically address the most urgent climate risks identified at the local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account local specificities, such as, socio-economic, identity characteristics and governance. Alongside the solutions, the proposal should support small and medium local authorities to close skills gaps and strengthen in-house capabilities for climate adaptation. To best focus the approaches and solutions to the local challenges, the proposal is expected to clearly identify the type of actors it addresses, being those either rural areas or small sized urban areas.</p><p>The participation of small and medium-sized local authorities in the consortium is strongly encouraged and would be evaluated positively as this can support the development in-house capacities and skills. However, as the capacity and availability for engagement of small / medium size local communities and in the rural area might be too limited to directly participate in the consortium, the proposal should at a minimum include specific considerations on how to facilitate their engagement and how their needs are reflected. This could take, for example, the form of a board or of a consultation body where they are directly engaged singularly or in association and/or grouping between themselves, should this be the preferred approach and form for the local authorities to delegate specific local competences, or could be achieved potentially leveraging the support already put in place by the Mission Implementation Platform.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three locations, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating? regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating? regions. Replicating regions/local authorities/communities are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare already the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.</p><p>Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects, including from beyond EU, addressing climate change adaptation and funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, or the Just Transition Fund.</p><p>Additionally, proposals should connect to other relevant projects funded by Horizon<s>-</s> Europe, in particular on just climate resilience and transformative approach funded by the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-05: Improve design for transformative approaches and build local capacity for implementation of available solutions focused on climate adaptation. Synergies and cooperation could also be beneficial with the projects funded under the topic HORIZON-CL6-2024-COMMUNITIES-02-1-two-stage: Innovating for climate-neutral rural communities by 2050.</p><p>Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with the Mission Implementation and the Climate-ADAPT platforms.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will get direct access and are expected to contribute into the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources.</p><p>In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.

However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities.

Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

To bring existing good practices in knowledge valorisation to support value creation across Europe, we need more experimentation, peer learning and testing of new models as well as trying out good practices in different environments.</p><p>Replication and adaptation of best practices is a powerful way to support the design, implementation and evaluation of knowledge valorisation investments and measures that enhance the quality and extent of knowledge uptake at all levels. It involves identifying and taking inspiration from best practices developed across Europe, engaging in an exchange of experiences with peers and connecting to new partners, as well as driving and supporting the set-up of new measures or the reform of existing ones. Cross-border transfer of best practices in knowledge valorisation is challenging because the corresponding strategies, initiatives or tools need to be adapted to a different context and legal and financial framework and take into account skills and competences available in the new setting.</p><p>Researchers can play an important role in engaging with citizens and bringing research results into communities that need innovative solutions. This can contribute to making research results more adapted to the needs of citizens and communities, and strengthen the uptake of research by society benefitting both the research communities and the citizens as users and co-creators.</p><p>Proposals should address at least one of the following challenges:</p><ol> <li><strong>Experimentation in knowledge valorisation</strong>, developing innovative ways to strengthen channels of valorising knowledge and research results, in particular targeting activities that engage citizens together with researchers in producing and taking up innovative solutions.. Within the scope of the topic are schemes and incentives for researchers to engage with society and for citizens and citizens' groups to engage in knowledge valorisation and promote the co-creation of new solutions and uptake of research results. This can include means to incentivise researchers to engage with society, contributing to a stronger translation of research results to the economy and society through better adaptation to citizens' needs and collaboration with industry, as well as co-creation of innovation schemes so that citizens' needs are addressed from the beginning. The experimentation will highlight what works well and under what conditions and what are the barriers and opportunities for greater knowledge valorisation through the collaboration of researchers and citizens;</li><li><strong>Transfer of best practices in knowledge valorisation</strong>, in the area of 'academia-industry/SME linkages' or 'quadruple helix-based innovation' (i.e., involving academia/research; industry/SMEs; public administration/policy-makers and society/citizens in an ecosystem approach). Consortia are expected to involve partners that implement one or several best practices and partners that plan to introduce a new practice or reform an existing one. The action will lead to tangible change in some or all participating entities in terms of strengthening knowledge valorisation capacities, be it at strategic and/or investment level and/or through the implementation of new or adapted instruments, tools, guidelines, trainings etc. The action can also help develop and prepare knowledge valorisation projects and investments that receive support from the European cohesion policy or the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). If support from the European cohesion policy or the RRF is sought, the concrete measures planned to be taken should be described.

Coupled to this ambition is the relaunch of the European Research Area (ERA) as described in the Commission Communication 'A new ERA for Research and Innovation? (COM/2020/628 final of 30.09.2020).</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of R&amp;I cooperation to provide solutions to society's most demanding needs. With the priority on delivering Europe's recovery as well as on the green and digital twin transitions, a new level of ambition, linking R&amp;I better with the economy, and with education and training, is needed to match these challenges and put scientific knowledge to work.</p><p>The new ERA calls for deepening existing priorities and creating new initiatives by strengthening the mobility of researchers and the free flow of knowledge and technology, to improve access to excellence, boost market uptake and prioritise investment and reform. Working together has been the philosophy of the ERA since its launch; however, the green and digital transitions and the COVID recovery call for more and closer cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and stakeholders.

Action 4 of the ERA Policy Agenda 2022-2024 - 'Promote attractive and sustainable research careers, balanced talent circulation and international, transdisciplinary and inter-sectoral mobility across the ERA? - annexed to the November 2021 Council Conclusions on the 'Future governance of the European Research Area' foresees the development of a European framework for research careers, together with the upgrade of existing instruments and initiatives, including the revision of the Charter for Researchers. It also includes amongst its expected outcomes the development of new instruments to support research careers, such as the one proposed with this call topic.</p><p>This action will promote implementing the standards for attractive careers as laid down in the new Charter for Researchers and the Council recommendation on a European framework for research careers, responding to the political call for ""labour market players to join forces for attractive careers?. It will support cooperation between academic, private and public sector entities at organisational level to create ecosystems that ensure attractive early research careers perspectives, provide researchers with skill sets that match labour market requirements, thus providing the talent pool needed for a truly functioning internal market for knowledge. Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>Establishment of ecosystems for research positions, in particular for early stage researchers, in academia, R&amp;I performing institutions and businesses, connecting research training providers (in particular academia) and the researchers' labour market (such as businesses, universities, research and technology organisations and government entities), supplying employers with skilled research talent that match labour market needs, including skills needs from the Green Deal, digital transition, and deep tech;</li><li>Wide implementation of the standards for attractive researcher careers as laid out in the new Charter for Researchers, leading to more attractive, more diverse and more interoperable careers for researchers across all sectors, contributing to a better-balanced and sustainable circulation of skilled and entrepreneurial workforce;</li><li>Improved early careers researchers' competences and employability within and beyond academia, as well as career interoperability between sectors.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The action supports consortia to create 'talent ecosystems' with a large pool of research and innovation positions operating under good training and working conditions in line with the new Charter for Researchers and the Council recommendation on a European framework for research careers, providing non-academic organisations, particularly businesses, with well-skilled researchers and other R&amp;I talents, thereby increasing employability of early career researchers and improving interoperability of their careers between sectors.</p><p>This action particularly supports whole organisations and innovation ecosystems to implement the standards for attractive research careers laid down in the Charter for Researchers. A special focus is placed on organisational change in support of early career researchers, to offer them more and better career opportunities, including through strengthened coordination of measures at European, national, and regional level and increased cooperation between academia, industry, government and public sector.</p><p>The action is expected to be implemented by consortia consisting of both training providers (in particular academia) and employers of researchers (academia and organisations from non-academic sector, in particular businesses) from across the European Research Area, creating connected 'talent ecosystems? that allow the free flow of talents and create attractive perspectives for researchers' careers within this ecosystem and beyond. A talent ecosystem for researchers is to be understood as a cohesive and interdependent system that encompasses various elements related to HR management of research talent. It can be thematic (e.g., targeted to R&amp;I on climate, pharma, automotive, music industry) or have a more comprehensive target. It is designed to adapt to the evolving needs of the researcher labour market and the different occupations for researchers across sectors along the R1-R4 profiles, ensuring more customised training, career development and talent flowthrough. Such ecosystem is built around delivering a better employee experience and aligning with frequently changing priorities; it is agile and flexible to environmental shifts in the R&amp;I system, such as changing labour market dynamics and skills needs. It provides distinct strategies for managing different research profiles, essential for competing in the global labour market, while delivering skilled research talent that match European labour market needs.</p><p>Consortia are expected to mainstream the Charter's principles and good working conditions across all participating organisations, which need to demonstrate in the application a high ambition as to the number of (new or existing) research positions that will benefit from the organisational change within the duration of the grant, ultimately leading to coverage of all its research staff. Participating organisations are expected to have received the HR Excellence in Research Award (HRS4R) or commit to apply the new Charter for Researchers and commit to its implementation (i.e., start the HRS4R process) within the grant duration, as far as relevant for their operations linked to the employment of researchers.</p><p>This action does not support salaries and mobility of individual researchers or teams of researchers. Instead, this action supports activities that lead to organisational change for more attractive research careers in line with the needs of R&amp;I labour market players, towards the creation of sustainable talent ecosystems.</p><p>Funding will support implementation of good working conditions and reinforce flowthrough of talents between sectors, towards better employability of talent trained as researcher and increased interoperability of research careers between academia and non-academic sector entities. Activities can include (non-exhaustive list) the mapping of challenges, the development of action plans to bring the organisations in line with the new Charter for Researchers, scaling excellence in HR, and networking and relationship building for connecting the talent ecosystem partners. On a more practical level, activities could include the roll out of ResearchComp in the organisational training and career development activities, the establishment of career services and training systems for early career researchers, the involvement of non-academic sector in the training of researchers, and relationship building between sectors for talent circulation.</p><p>This action is a pilot, testing the principles for a future investment strategy for attractive research careers at whole organisation and ecosystem level. Actions are therefore expected to provide policy feedback to the European Commission and Member States on the progress made, the success generated, and the obstacles encountered.

The action will support the co-creation of narratives, and innovative visualisation tools such as maps, related to different scenarios of what the EU and its ocean, seas and water spaces could look like by 2030 and 2050 if innovative solutions to restore our ocean and waters would be applied, so that the targets of the Mission Ocean and Waters and consequently those of the European Green Deal are fully reached. These narratives must be supported by the co-design of different science-based transition pathways together with citizens including students and key stakeholders such as scientists, experts and decision-makers responsible for planning ocean and water spaces. The co-design process should be inclusive, participatory following transdisciplinary and structured science-policy-society interface methodologies and taking into consideration environmental, social, economic and political considerations.</p><p>Following on from a pan-European vision, proposals should also develop specific regional visions, scenarios and narratives for each of the four Mission lighthouse areas in the Atlantic-Arctic, Danube, Mediterranean Sea, Baltic and North Sea, supported by innovative visualisation tools and co-created by multi-actors such as local stakeholders and citizens. By choosing a minimum of four large scale case-studies, the action should enable the participatory co-design of alternative futures where the Mission objectives have been achieved in the lighthouse area, and develop together with the relevant stakeholders the action pathways and necessary narratives to achieve these alternative futures.</p><p>Proposals should develop and visualise different scenarios for each of the case-studies, with both 2030- and 2050-time horizons in line with the Mission Restore our Ocean and Waters and EU Green Deal targets. They should at least encompass a business-as-usual scenario, in which current trends are extrapolated, as well as a scenario where European Green Deal and relevant environmental legislation (e.g. Marine Strategy Framework Directive, Birds and Habitats Directives, Water Framework Directive) targets for climate, biodiversity and pollution are fully reached through the large-scale deployment of innovative solutions. The change scenario(s) should build on deliverables of relevant Mission related projects, best practices on citizen participation and deliberative democracy, national initiatives as well as state-of-the-art models and draw on data and projections from the IPCC, IPBES, European Environment Agency and JRC. Finally, they should rely on and be compatible with the EU Digital Twin Ocean developments and eventually become one of its use-cases.</p><p>Scenarios of the future should in particular include the deployment at scale of innovative solutions with a special emphasis on nature-based solutions, which are proven to be environmentally, economically and socially effective and which address in particular the climate change, biodiversity and pollution driven challenges to the ocean and water system, including biodiversity loss and its impacts on marine ecosystems and sectors relying on it, sea level rise, extreme weather, as well as pollution of the seas, coasts and rivers. The scenarios should take the objectives of current EU policies and legislation into consideration for their design.</p><p>Proposals are expected to develop a map and visualisations as an interactive, dynamic and digital tool and application to be co-created and used by citizens, including schools and planners at EU, national, regional and where applicable local level, using whenever possible the Digital Twin of the Ocean core public infrastructure and its services.

Mission Adaptation to Climate Change assessment report</em>?.</p><p>More specifically, the successful project is expected to contribute to <strong>all of</strong> the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>The national relevant governance for innovation and climate adaptation is further engaged and mobilised to contribute to the objectives of the EU Mission on adaptation to climate change, and benefit from it.</li><li>The EU Mission is deeply connected with national multi-level governance feeding into Member States, regions and local authorities' efforts to implement the European Climate Law's requirements on climate adaptation, and to further develop and update their national, regional and local adaptation plans. </li><li>A set of 'National Adaptation Hubs' bridge the gap between the EU and regional/local levels, in the Adaptation mission and further disseminate the solutions emerging from the Mission to other regions and local authorities that are not Charter Signatories.</li><li>A robust twinning scheme grouping of regions and local actors facing similar challenges ensures peer-learning and cross-fertilisation of experiences, further strengthening ongoing peer learning opportunities within the EU Mission, and also providing a tool to disseminate EU Mission's knowledge beyond the regions and local authorities directly participating in the EU Mission.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Regional and local authorities are the target groups of the proposed activities and as such they are not expected to participate directly in the consortium, but they should receive services from the project funded by this action.</p><p>In order to achieve the indicated scope, the project could provide direct financial support in the form of grants to maximum one entity in each of the MS in facilitating the creation and animation of the 'National Adaptation Hub?. To implement the support to third parties, the consortium should include partners with relevant operational and financial experience and viability.</p><p>It is expected that the project will have a duration of about 2 years.</p><p>Proposals should address two axes of action: 1) establishing and managing so-called 'National adaptation hubs?; and 2) implementing a structural grouping scheme as organic component of the multi-governance approach.</p><p>For each of the axes of action, proposals should address <strong><u>all</u></strong> the following aspects identified :</p><ol> <li><em>National adaptation hubs</em></li></ol><ul><li>Identify relevant actors at National level, in cooperation with existing national experts/working groups (such as Climate Advisory bodies or members of the Working Group on adaptation of the Horizon Europe Strategic Programme Committee and the Working Group on Adaptation (WGA) under the Climate Change Committee or the managing authorities of the cohesion policy or rural development funds), as well as at regional and local level, to facilitate the connection and integration of the Mission's approach at national level.</li><li>Concretely, proposals should aim at mobilising National, regional, and local actors and foster the<strong> creation of dedicated 'National adaptation hubs?</strong> for the EU Mission on adaptation to climate change. Such hubs (one per country) consist in a sort of task force or working group composed of the relevant contact points from each level of governance relevant in the individual countries. Those structures are meant to be light, agile, and flexible, to be tailored to the national context. Some countries are already piloting national structures aiming at supporting and complementing the EU Mission at national level (in some cases with more formal and complex structures than the flexible working groups foreseen in this project). In such cases National hubs would consist or would be an integration of such existing structures, which can be served by the project via information products or logistic support in view of helping them to better align and cooperate with the Adaptation Mission. If relevant in the national context, some of those hubs could also tackle the interface between climate adaptation and mitigation by integrating or cooperating with any existing structure dedicated this objective.</li><li>Foster <strong>knowledge and solutions sharing</strong> and implement dedicated horizontal supporting actions, such as help shaping the National adaptation hubs identifying and connecting national and subnational priorities, create multilingual horizontal information and communication products to help feed the feedback-loop between Adaptation Mission and the National adaptation hubs, including by identifying good practices exchanged as part of the grouping scheme.To retrieve such information, the project funded under this topic is expected to closely cooperate with the project stemming from the topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CLIMA-01-01 and the different projects in the Adaptation Mission Portfolio, under the coordination of the Mission Implementation Platform.</li><li>Ensure that the knowledge gained by the regions directly participating in the Adaptation Mission is shared with other regions within a certain Member State, further disseminating such knowledge via their own existing channels. These hubs can, in fact, be a first step to bring EU Mission's knowledge to the regions and local authorities that are not directly participating in EU Mission's activities, while the EU Mission continues to work with a limited set of regions and local authorities as testbeds for climate adaptation solutions.</li><li>National adaptation hubs should also feed and contribute to countries and regional and local authorities' efforts related to the adaptation objectives in the Climate Law - with particular reference to the adoption and implementation of national adaptation strategies and plans. National adaptation hubs should support the implementation of adaptation plans, liaising with the relevant national, regional or local authorities to integrate the knowledge developed within the Mission into the development and selection process of projects on the ground, in particular when financed by EU funds. Moreover, in this light, they should also help connect public authorities with existing support opportunities such as TAIEX-EIR PEER 2 PEER, the Commission's Technical Support Instrument, etc.</li><li>Build on existing relevant initiatives, such as the TRAMI project [or followers] and the NCP4missions, the new National Contact Points Network, as well as other relevant thematic national hubs, to avoid duplications, ensure horizontal synergies and complement existing structures when relevant for the Adaptation Mission. The proposal should also ensure close collaboration with the Mission Implementation Platform, which, at the moment, does not foresee specific budget to organise activities at National level. In such context, the project will remain in close contacts with the Mission's Secretariat. The project will connect the exchange done via the EU Mission's Community of Practice (managed by the Mission Implementation Platform) with the subsequent follow-ups, dissemination, and further discussion at 'National adaptation hubs? level, effectively connecting and helping the coordination of their activities. Moreover, the project should also ensure that National adaptation hubs connect with the EU Mission Board, to fully exploit further synergies with its members.</p></li><li>Build on the EU Mission's key community systems and enabling conditions to identify the priority areas of work of the 'National adaptation hubs?, by engaging and exchanging with the National and regional contact points. These priority areas should reflect what is included in the National Strategies and/or Plans on Adaptation to Climate Change. In addition, the action should also identify areas of exchange that are particularly suited for discussion at National level (such as the concept of just transition, including by addressing the social angle of adaptation to climate change) or where existing gaps require specific attention (such as access to finance), or there is high potential for cooperation (the nexus climate adaptation and mitigation).</li><li>Last, National adaptation hubs could be suited to engage with the private sector at national, regional, local level. They should also involve climate pact ambassadors (when relevant), to help amplifying the impacts of these initiative with the civil society.</li></ul><ol> <li><em>Grouping scheme</em></li></ol><ul><li>To facilitate the concrete dissemination of knowledge, the proposal should foresee a <strong>structural grouping scheme</strong>. In particular, the scheme should bring together regions and local actors facing similar challenges, and it should help consolidate the multi-level governance. Such scheme might see groups or pairs from the same Member State (to feed the knowledge sharing within each 'national adaptation hubs? and cascade knowledge across a national territory) or between different countries. In turn, the proposal should ensure close connections with the Mission's Community of Practice.</li><li>The grouping exercise will also help disseminating the Mission's knowledge beyond the regions directly served by the Mission - hence substantiating the new 'multi-level governance?. In this context, the proposal should identify the right grouping and pairing participants able to bring the knowledge they acquired by participating in Mission-funded and Mission-related activities (for example, when testing adaptation solutions as part of Mission projects' work) to other regions in the EU, with particular attention to vulnerable regions. Moreover, in some cases the scheme might group and /or pair, depending on demand, less advanced regions with front-runners. When developing the scheme, the proposal should ideally involve the National level into the peer learning scheme, including by ensuring that the best practices shared via the grouping scheme can also feed the National level in view of policy innovation (see point on Climate Law requirements).</li></ul><p>Likewise, the grouping should be equally open and encouraged for Mission's signatories to be clustered and/ or paired with other Mission's signatories so as to complement ongoing matchmaking and peer learning efforts as part of the Mission Implementation Platform, and other Mission's initiatives.</p> <p>COM(2023) 457 final: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-07/com_2023_457_1_en_act_part1.pdf"">com_2023_457_1_en_act_part1.pdf (europa.eu)</a></p><p>https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/52e75b81-537f-11ee-9220-01aa75ed71a1/language-en</p><p>For example, the European Environment Information and Observation Network (Eionet)</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/law-and-governance/environmental-implementation-review/peer-2-peer_en"">https://environment.ec.europa.eu/law-and-governance/environmental-implementation-review/peer-2-peer_en</a></p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.trami5missions.eu/"">About TRAMI | TRAMI (trami5missions.eu)</a></p><p>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101121092</p><p>Currently managed by MIP4Adapt under the contract CINEA/2022/OP/0013/SI2.884597 funded by the European Union. <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/mission/the-mission/about-mip4adapt"">About MIP4Adapt (europa.eu)</a><p>As defined in the Mission Implementation Plan: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf"">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/climat_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf</a></p>","<p>In February 2021, the European Commission adopted an<strong> EU strategy on adaptation to climate change </strong>that sets out how the EU can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate resilient by 2050.</p><p>Pushing further on the belief that we must adjust now to tomorrow's climate, the EU has launched a specific mission to foster the resilience of all, be it regions, cities, local communities, to climate change.

It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong> and to accelerate their transformation to become <strong>climate resilient. </strong>By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

The Mission will support many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): in particular restoring our ocean and waters related actions will directly contribute to SDG 14 - Life below water and SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation, as well as to SDG13 - Climate action.</p><p>The Mission will also contribute to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development [[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.oceandecade.org/"">https://www.oceandecade.org/</a>]] by fostering research and cooperation across European sea basins, including the EU Outermost Regions and beyond, and mobilise scientists, as well as citizens for a sustainable and healthy ocean, seas and waters.</p><p>The implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as implementation details of the Mission 'Restore our Ocean, seas and waters by 2030"" [[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/research_and_innovation/funding/documents/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf</a>]].</p><p>The Mission Work Programme, under Horizon Europe, will contribute to the recovery of our ocean and waters by 2030 and more specifically to the following objectives:</p><ol> <li>Protect and restore marine and freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity, in line with the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030[[<sup></sup>COM/2020/380 final]];</li><li>Prevent and eliminate pollution of our ocean, seas and waters, in line with the EU Action Plan Towards Zero Pollution for Air, Water and Soil[[<sup></sup>COM/2021/400 final]];</li><li>Make the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular, in line with the proposed European Climate Law[[<sup></sup>COM/2020/563 final]] and the holistic vision enshrined in the Communication on a new approach for a Sustainable Blue Economy[[<sup></sup>COM/2021/240 final]].</li></ol><p>The Mission will be implemented in two phases:</p><ul><li>In the first 'development and piloting' phase (2022-2025), research and innovation will lay the foundations for implementing the three Mission objectives and enabling actions, paving the way to further citizens participation and engagement. Research and innovation activities will support transformative and innovative solutions to be tested, piloted and validated. Enabling activities will generate new knowledge, observation and monitoring data.</li><li>In the second 'deployment and upscaling' phase (2026-2030), the solutions will be further deployed, replicated and scaled up.</li></ul><p>The Mission ocean and waters supports research and innovation in a system of European and national funding programmes sharing policy objectives. To foster synergies between R&amp;I funding instruments (European and national), align R&amp;I investments, ensure access to excellence and translate research results for the benefit of the society and the economy, applicants should consider and actively seek complementarities with, and where appropriate possibilities for further funding from other R&amp;I-relevant EU, national or regional programmes for a sustainable blue economy, notably EMFF/EMFAF, LIFE, ERDF, ESF+, JTF, CEF Inland Waterways or Maritime and InvestEU, as well as private funds or financial instruments. All actions of the Mission are expected to disseminate their results according to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles compatible with ongoing EU initiatives such as the European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). In line with this approach, specific actions within the Mission will be devoted to widening access to data and knowledge of oceans, seas and freshwater through the Digital Twin Ocean (Mission ocean and waters digital knowledge system).</p><p>All proposals submitted to the calls listed below are required to show how their proposed activities and results will achieve the Mission's objectives, in line with the timeframe of the Mission phases, i.e.: by 2025 for the 'development and piloting' phase and 2030 for the 'deployment and upscaling phase'.</p><p>The 2024 work programme is structured around two groups of activities:</p><ul><li>The first one will complement previous topics on Blue Parks by addressing off-shore marine protection, will support activities to restore and protect migratory fish habitats in freshwaters and will enhance Blue Economy sustainability by demonstrating innovative tools and methods to mitigate the impact of fisheries on sensitive species. One topic addresses the Danube River basin lighthouse whilst a second topic targets the three Mission sea basins lighthouses, i.e.: the Atlantic and Arctic sea basin, the Baltic and North Sea basin and the Mediterranean Sea basin.</li><li>The second group of activities will provide a comprehensive package of support for Mission communities of actors under all four Mission lighthouses in order to accelerate progress towards achieving the Mission objectives and targets. It will also support a coalition of waterfront cities, regions and islands, and a topic on future vision of a restored ocean and water system in the EU.</li></ul><p>Activities to further enhance the development of the European Digital Twin of the Ocean and to further engage with citizens are also covered.</p>",,,,

Undoubtedly, UxVs exploitation is likely to grow in the coming years with the massive introduction of other autonomous systems in different domains (land, air, sea, space, cyber) and the increase of capabilities to work collaboratively between systems (swarms) and people.</p><p>Indeed, intelligent and effective cooperation between military assets (UxVs, different types of vehicles and their operators, and dismounted soldiers) within Close Combat Operations is needed to increase the overall Battlespace effectiveness, while reducing loss of life, the risk of collateral damage and lowering the cognitive burden placed upon operators.</p><p>Therefore, deploying autonomous and swarm-based military assets in a framework of cooperation between manned and unmanned systems (manned-unmanned teaming) is a very important capability that can enable enhanced ISTAR, survivability, situation awareness, mobility, lethality, logistics and training, and increase the probability of battlefield combat success.</p><p>This would allow the rapid development of capacities implying an incremental approach of capabilities milestones for current and future land systems and upgrades of legacy systems.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The use of such UxV systems has a direct impact in reducing the exposure of human operators and soldiers to associated risks.

This should ensure transferability of technology with other manned and unmanned (including drive-by-wire legacy) platforms.</li><li>Federated digital-twin framework would favour this TCLM management and may provide improved training environment for UGS navigation and other mission specific algorithms.</li><li>State-of-the-art equipment and secure information availability to enable enhanced ISTAR, Survivability, Situational Awareness, Mobility, Lethality, Logistics and Training to ensure Battlefield Superiority.</li><li>Self-air-defence (against NATO Class I UAVs), in support of dismounted soldiers, with automatic designation by on-board electro-optical sensors and related data fusion.</li></ul><p>Additional enablers for the wide acceptance and use of the Systems are:</p><ul><li>Formation of UGS related R&amp;D ecosystem/community that facilitates continuous innovation, synergies and inclusion of deep-tech start-ups, Technology and system testing, Evaluation, Verification and Validation (e.g., cross-border TEVV procedures, trust).</li><li>Practical testing in a scenario-based exercise (48+ h) with infantry units.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address the development of a multipurpose Unmanned Ground System of systems with lethal effectors and solutions for systems integration and manned-unmanned teaming.

EDF-2024-DA-ENERENV-EEMC-STEP,Energy-independent and energy-efficient systems for military camps,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,40000000,40000000,,46905571,46905531EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>The future battlefield is likely to be dominated by weapon systems, platforms and devices that require electric energy. This type of battlefield, previously purely oil-based from cradle to grave, to integrate energy management technologies, buffer storage resources and a camp/weapon system interface in a constrained and contested tactical environment, is in need of a comprehensive review of its energy production and distribution. It requires the implementation of a coherent and efficient energy network, from the energy production systems at operational level to the soldiers at tactical level, through all the layers of the distribution systems.</p><p>In parallel, the EU defence sector has to start its digital and green energy transition to contribute to the EU net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and to anticipate growing energy costs linked to the vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies becoming increasingly scarce and disputed.</p><p>This development entails major risks for military activities. The multiplication of low-carbon energy sources and the risk of more complex logistics are an additional challenge for manoeuvres. It is also an opportunity to meet the growing demand for future weapons systems, platforms and devices.</p><p>An energy-independent and energy efficient deployable military camp, as part of the future electric battlefield, is the first step towards an operational and tactical integrated energy supply chain. It serves as a starting point, hub for innovative electric energy generation and efficient distribution throughout all levels. This includes initial definitions of interface between the stationary components (operational level) and the mobile components (tactical level) of the electric battlefield.</p><p>As the role of the military camps, as an energy provider has been emphasised, scaling-up of its technological bricks (energy generation, storage and distribution) needs to be amplified while covering a wide range of operational scenarios.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to substitute the fossil fuel dependency reduction in military deployable camps (support and mobility) without any drop of operational performances, in a context of increasing electrical energy demand in the battlefield. Moreover, investigation on the return of experience of the demonstration stage, should include specifications of a whole concept of energy independent and efficient deployable camps. Furthermore, the ability to support the diminution of their fossil fuel consumptions while maintaining operational performances, avoiding logistics, security burden and reducing logistics footprint should be validated.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address a full-scale operational demonstrator of a deployable camp fulfilling interoperability between inter-allied armies and NATO, with a modular and easily deployable energy system and adaptable energy mix.</p><p>Proposals must pursue the feasibility study of different technologies to answer to the identified needs of the Member States and EDF Associated Countries while ensuring the interoperability of systems and taking into consideration opportunities such as autonomy or resilience. As innovative solutions evolve rapidly, the proposals should update results generated through the latest research in this domain. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness of logistics and maintenance in different scenarios (e.g., Host Nation Support, Contractor Support to Operations or by military themselves).</p><p>Proposals must design and produce the solutions (production, storage and management modules, including control and command interfaces, communication protocols, and operational simulation and planning systems). In order to ensure their safe use, functional tests must be performed before the demonstration stage.</p><p>Proposals must address physical experiment of the most critical technological modules deployed in military camps, especially the most vulnerable ones toward harsh environmental conditions and demanding operational scenarios, including resilience against electronic warfare, cyber-attacks and electromagnetic pulse.</p><p>Proposals must split the demonstration of the technological modules in different locations hosted by several Member States in different representative environment (cold/warm weather, dust, number of occupants, deployment duration, type of mission, etc.). In addition, the proposals must validate a wide range of operational use cases and assess the adaptability of the technology for the deployment in different scenarios.

EDF-2024-DA-C4ISR-AIMA-STEP,AI-based multifunctional aperture and transceiver,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,45000000,45000000,,46905571,46905501EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>To cope with multi-dimensional warfighting environments, modern militaries need relevant situational awareness across all domains. They also need to be able to both operate cross-domain capabilities, such as any-sensor-to-any-shooter networking, and prevent the enemy from doing so. This requires communications systems that can perform ad hoc networking in all domains in dynamically evolving tactical situations. Currently, this is done with mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) data links.</p><p>As wireless solutions such as the Internet of Battlefield Things proliferate, the electromagnetic spectrum is likely to become an increasingly important source of situational awareness. Passive electronic monitoring, detection, classification and localisation of enemy radio frequency emitters is part of the recognised situational picture. Traditionally, this has been the task of electronic warfare (EW) units and their specific equipment providing electronic support (ES) to combat units.</p><p>To counter a detected threat, forces can use kinetic- (KE) and directed-energy (DE) means with their weapon systems, or electronic protection (EP) and attack (EA) if they have jamming systems, traditionally equipment carried and used by dedicated EW units. Before directing fire at detected targets, soldiers must mitigate the risk of friendly fire. At long ranges and in poor visibility, this requires radio communications with either self-positioning based Blue Force Tracking (BFT) or interrogation-based Identification Friend or Foe (IFF).</p><p>Today, MANET data links, ES receivers, jammers, BFT and IFF are separate pieces of equipment requiring decentralised control, separate installation space, power supply, cabling, antennas, etc. By combining these functionalities into a single autonomously controlled equipment, it would be possible to achieve better performance, higher reliability, lower weight and lower life cycle costs.</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned technological reasons for converged aperture, there is also a need for converged systems. The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is expected to continue to be contested, congested and constrained. Military use of the EMS is under serious pressure from the civil community. Civilian, dual-use and military applications intermingle in the EMS currently in use, challenging the freedom and security of operation (OPSEC) of military users. With Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, systems are likely to be able to dynamically perform mission and threat analysis, situational awareness, positioning and navigation, and jamming. This means dynamic adaptation to prevailing conditions at machine speed. This would require AI-based operation at the device and system of systems (fleet/network) level in order to coordinate actions of several systems with minimal detectability and platform losses.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to design, develop and build a system that should:</p><ul><li>Accelerate command and control (C2) and enhance operational effectiveness by providing cross-domain mobile ad-hoc networking capabilities to the armed forces.</li><li>Increase lethality by enabling faster firing and reducing the risk of collateral damages, including fratricide, by providing the means to detect and target the enemy and to locate, track and identify friendly forces.</li><li>Reduce enemy lethality and increase own protection by avoiding detection with AI-based emission control, stealthy waveforms and by jamming enemy communications.</li><li>Provide autonomous mission management of several systems (including detection, jamming and targeting) within the network in order to improve survivability, and autonomously take actions to meet the mission objectives with the aid of AI.</li><li>Be capable of operating in all weather conditions, in particular in the challenging Arctic environment and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied areas.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address study, development and qualification of new generation scalable and cognitive (AI-controlled) multifunctional software defined (SD) transceiver for military use in manned and unmanned platforms. The ultimate objective of the proposals must be to achieve a qualified prototype for end-user demonstrations with a view to obtain end-user commitment for operational use.</p><p>Proposals may also provide a framework for the development of new standards, including proposals for intelligent and effective spectrum management, and prepare to contribute to future standards.

EDF-2024-DA-CYBER-NGCR-STEP,Next-Generation Cooperative Cyber Range,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,48000000,48000000,,46905571,46905521EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>Cyber range technologies have seen notable uptake over the last decade. They form a cornerstone of cyber defence training and testing. The objective of this topic is to take further the ongoing cyber range technology roadmap by designing and implementing next-generation solutions. The key consideration is on the cooperative approach in developing and using those cyber range technologies, thereby facilitating joint capability development.</p><p>Technological investments and developments have so far mostly focused on various fundamental needs such as visualisation, scoring, realistic scenarios, and federation. Separate mature technological building blocks exist in modern cyber and IT solutions. However, these developments have yet to be consolidated into the context of cyber ranges for defence purposes, in a manner such as the PESCO project <em>Cyber Ranges Federation</em>.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to address the remaining challenge on design and development of solutions that deliver notable progress vis-�-vis the current state-of-the-art, including in view of wider technology landscape. This means that focus has to shift from creating cyber ranges that fulfil basic needs to cyber ranges that target next-level capability requirements. Therefore, the specific objective is about the use of cyber ranges for trainings and exercises. The proposed solutions, however, can benefit also other cyber range use-cases such as product development and penetration testing. Therefore, considerations of such use-cases may be taken into account for developing the solutions.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The next-generation cooperative cyber range capability must address at least the following issues:</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises with classified information, especially for cross-border exercises by EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>Although the use of classified information in national exercises and trainings is not a new phenomenon, it is, firstly, still absent from the capabilities of many nations and, secondly, there is no existing solution that offers an EU-wide, cross-border classified capability. Such a capability could help various countries in using this functionality which they otherwise would not be able to use and it would provide a currently unavailable solution to conducting exercises across nations, including for topics such as information sharing and ensuring confidentiality of related data. This would also benefit the EU's military structure, e.g., EU Military Staff, European Defence Agency and others.</p><p>Moreover, such a capability can be used by nations internally, e.g., for its different security agencies both in defence and national security to increase interoperability.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises covering the entire chain of cyber defence operations from planning through conduct up to review, including by utilising realistic mission networks. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>Most large-scale technical cyber exercises that are currently conducted do not sufficiently cover all relevant aspects of cyberspace operations. While such aspects are sometimes covered in non-technical exercises, these tend to not sufficiently well incorporate technical cyber defence teams. As a result, truly comprehensive and effective exercises are difficult to deliver.</p><p>The aspects that surround these technical activities (e.g., operation planning, legal considerations) and which complement incident management (e.g., intelligence activities) require different scenarios and different technical exercise environments in comparison to existing capabilities. The latter also includes the challenge of creating realistic federated mission networks for training purposes.</p><p>Key aspects in this entire chain are also the analysis of the performance of the cyber operators and the scoring of cyber security situational awareness.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Leveraging Artificial Intelligence throughout the delivery of trainings and exercises (e.g., for Blue, Red, White and Green Teams) </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>The use of AI in different phases and parts of cyber exercises and trainings has been researched and developed to an extent. This includes, for example, AI-based scenario generation, and AI-based Red/Blue Teams with hybrid skills (human + AI-based attack/defend strategies (developed in different private companies). AI also plays a pivotal role in generating comprehensive situational awareness for the development of realistic federated missions.</p><p>In the area of federated missions, which employ multiple teams operating from different locations, AI technologies could help to identify the operational deficiencies within each team member, informing subsequent training customisation and generating tailored scenarios.</p><p>It is clear that AI can assist in these and in other parts of cyber capability development. The proposals are expected to provide AI-based solutions that target all major parts of cyber exercise and training delivery, as well as AI-based solutions for the performance evaluation of the trainees using the hybrid skills.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Set up of trainings and exercises that leverage the concept of digital twins. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>Digital twins as a concept has a long history. The use of such solutions in cyber exercises has also been targeted previously but not with results that have been sufficiently persistent or useful. Therefore, the challenge remains on developing digital twins or other high-fidelity simulations that have a reasonable cost-effectiveness - given that a common dilemma in such simulations is finding a balance between cost of creating such digital copies and the learning impact that those simulations can offer on top of more standardised ways for IT/OT system and network simulations. One possible avenue for successful balancing of these requirements may be witnessed in the space domain, given its increased need for simulations and testing.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Develop or facilitate a framework for accreditation of training centres and personnel skill levels. </strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>The solutions should include a proposal on how to establish certified practices for accreditation of training centres (cyber ranges) and skill levels (personal and team certificates). The solution should take into account EU-wide accreditation schemes. However, these should allow for national specificities. Where possible, existing standards, such as relevant NATO practices, should be used.</p><ol> <li> <ol> <li><strong>Cross-cutting items</strong></li> </ol></li></ol><p>All solutions must address the <strong>challenge of sharing and pooling cyber range capabilities </strong>in a coordinated manner between cyber range providers. This challenge may be best addressed by using and enhancing existing initiatives and projects. Moreover, this sharing and pooling can be demonstrated, for example, via the implementation of the project's solutions in different cyber ranges through federation. If federation as an approach is used, it is expected that the proposals also cover the business and management side of the federation. This could, for example, formalise in the development of model cooperation agreements that mimic actual needs and have been developed with processes similar to actual processes (twin environments).</p><p>Where existing or new cyber range and cyber exercise standards (e.g., for scenario development and game net creation) are covered, the proposal must address the challenge of achieving a wide user-based of the standard. Proposing the use of any such standards without clearly addressing the way forward may invalidate the whole part of the proposal related to such standards because the success of a standard is as much dependent on the community as the standard's actual content.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this

Therefore, the main objective of this topic is to identify, define, design, and develop them, to be integrated on future European naval platforms.</p><p>The topic should act as a real enabler for both the European naval industry and the EU Navies. In that context, it should be very inclusive to be adapted to the most European Navies' needs for their future naval platforms. It will allow EU Navies to remain at the forefront of technology, to maximise interoperability and the survivability by design, to operate with technological superiority, and to increase EU strategic autonomy. At industrial level, this topic should be an instrument for the European industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to define the common operational requirements of the System of Systems (SoS) framework and the essential elements of the next generation of European naval platforms. Such a SoS framework is expected to embrace the supporting infrastructure including interfaces, data, and common and specific services. It must identify the technological needs for the future development of European naval platforms with special attention on emerging technologies, promising solutions, and the increased resilience of naval vessels when facing the most sophisticated threats by near real-time evaluation of survivability.</p><p>In particular, the topic should contribute to solve these specific challenges:</p><ul><li>The capability to operate interconnected in a fully integrated way, under challenging multi-domain (i.e., land, aerial, surface, subsurface and cyber) threat conditions.</li><li>The definition and the design of the core architecture of the future European naval platforms by a SoS approach.</li><li>The analysis of naval vessels survivability aspects on an operational level, considering its three key aspects (i.e., susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability) under an integral approach, leading to a resilient ship.</li></ul><p>This topic aims to identify and define essential elements for future European naval platforms as functional system building blocks by specifying a full set of new technologies, solutions, and systems to be fitted on board, covering the following main areas:</p><ul><li>Four pillars:</li><li><strong>Combat System.</strong> New threats based on emerging technologies lead to the development of combat systems with enhanced sensors collaborating under an extended top-side concept that increase the detection capability, in time and accuracy, as well as new weapons/effectors able to face them, based on decision making algorithms to allow shorter reaction time to engage those threats. The UxVs are to be integrated into the Combat System as an extension of the detection and defence capability. In terms of survivability, specific challenges to susceptibility are the required countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, together with the ability to predict and manage where a missile or a torpedo might impact the vessel, as an important interface between susceptibility and vulnerability. UxVs should be also analysed in relation to ship survivability.</li><li><strong>Communication and Information System. </strong>Solutions need to be sought to meet emerging challenges in this area such as the management of a big volume of data transmitted at high speed (comparable to 5G and ahead) in a very demanding operational theatre, the integrity and cybersecurity of the data, and the EU naval tactical cloud integrated in a military multidomain operations cloud. Special consideration should be made on anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) scenarios, defining embarked cloud capabilities to support the edge operation of joint forces overseas. Attention must also be paid to complete loss of connectivity due to denial or due to stealth reasons.</li><li><strong>Enhanced Platform Management System</strong>. New threats and evolving technologies should lead to redefine the current concept of naval platforms to ensure enough and adequate power generation, as well as a proper top-side compatible with new weapons and UxV launch and recovery systems (LARS) on board. In the same way, future naval platforms should address efficient platform control and management, as well as increased power supply needs for future weapons and sensors, and new energy technologies to achieve the European Green Deal objectives. In addition, ship signature management, smart damage control, and survivability aspects should be considered because countermeasures, both hard-kill and soft-kill, and their deployment, or the impact of hypersonic missile or torpedo affect the vulnerability of the platform (e.g., a successful hard-kill engagement might result in debris hitting the ship, the success soft-kill deployments strongly affect the ship signatures). The impact of such events should be studied, and technical solutions to withstand the physical and system damage should be identified.</li><li><strong>Navigation System.</strong> Solutions should be sought for increased safety during navigation, independent satellite positioning system, accurate inertial navigation system, autonomous operations and multi-manned and unmanned, underwater, surface, and aerial vehicles coordinated navigation.</li><li>One transversal area linked to the four pillars:</li><li><strong>Survivability Advisory System Foundation</strong>. The evolving threat landscape should result in a need for an advisory capability to assist in the setting of the ship signature management system, the deployment of hard-kill and soft-kill countermeasures, the adjustment of the ship's signature for hit-point management, the post-hit damage assessment, the remaining capability including strength and systems, and the deployment of recovery actions to regain functionality. This should also allow for future task group advisory capabilities, where high value assets should be protected by the task group, and the survivability of the task group is expected to be optimised due to advice across the task group.</li></ul><p>Proposals should design a SoS framework: Solutions should be sought based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution, that might sustain the above-mentioned areas. It should include transversal capabilities like for instance, Artificial Intelligence (AI) Based Decision Making, Digital Twin, Federated Mission Networking, Through-Life Support based on virtual reality and remote systems monitoring, Cyberwarfare, or Survivability</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address:</p><ul><li>The definition of common operational requirements of the essential elements for the future European naval platforms, covering the main areas (i.e., Combat System, Communication and Information System, Enhanced Platform Management System and Navigation System) under an integral survivability approach (i.e., Survivability Advisory System Foundation);</li><li>The development of a concept of a SoS framework, typically based on a service-oriented architecture or any other evolution that might sustain the concerned areas;</li><li>The definition of a modular, interoperable, scalable, and flexible concept design to support an architecture that should provide a versatile solution for answering future Navies� needs and trends;</li><li>The identification of emerging technologies that should respond to the operational needs of the future naval platforms, including integrated operational data-, messaging-, telecom-communication systems;</li><li>The design of a tool for the management of the ship signature while advising on the status and solutions for timely and accurate deployment of countermeasures, both active (e.g., advanced jammers, signature manipulators) and passive (e.g., flares, chaff, corner cubes), coordinated with hard-kill solutions, and including the prediction and management of the hit-point;</li><li>The assessment of existing solutions and the consideration of new damage control systems where appropriate through automated systems, crew actions, and recovery of systems, while performing predictions of the state of the ship after incidents, likely based on AI that processes sensor readings/information and imaging;</li><li>The design of an operational guidance system to support the Navigation System for ship operations with a damaged and undamaged ship (e.g., advice for helicopter operations, UxV deployment);</li><li>The identification of the priorities on technologies to be further develop in the future, as well as the level of maturity to be achieved for the associated elements;</li><li>The analysis of a tool for the European naval industry to assess and reinforce its ability to develop and support emerging key technologies;</li><li>The operational assessment and the analysis of the technical viability, as well as the evaluation of the feasibility of the baseline concepts;</li><li>The design of a joint technology demonstrator and to de-risk potential further activities in the future.</li></ul><p>In addition, the proposals should substantiate synergies and complementarities, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with activities described in previous call topics under

There is a need for exchange of classified information in MUS. Identification, authentication and authorisation are important functionalities in the field of digital trusted gateways. Further research needs to be done to overcome the physical characteristics of the underwater environment that limits the possibility of having wireless communication systems with sufficient robustness and bandwidth required by many underwater warfare functions.</p><p>The specific objective is to design and demonstrate feasibility of secured (communications security COMSEC and transmission security TRANSEC) underwater (network) communication solutions (acoustic, optical, or other modalities) for UUSs designed for military needs.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The proposals must address research of secure underwater communication, with focus on <strong>acoustic</strong> technologies, including networked solutions, that contribute to the improvement of current performance, through the creation of new low-distortion modulation techniques, interference avoidance/suppression mechanisms, recovery from fading, etc. This requires the communication to be highly adaptive and self-reconfigurable. To improve the performance of the acoustic underwater communication channel, the environmental conditions in situ, such as noise, depth, sound velocity profile, etc., must be considered.</p><p>Furthermore, research in underwater communication, with focus on <strong>optical</strong> technologies, must be addressed, with the aim of improving bandwidth and transmission distance, reducing signal distortion, in order to improve communication within and between platforms, networks and infrastructures.</p><p>The security aspects should be included in the underwater communication systems. The challenging communication conditions (low data rate, long latency, delay and Doppler spread effects, highly varying channel conditions and high noise levels, etc), which may result in unreliable and low-bandwidth communication links, also give special challenges for security mechanisms. This should be taken into account in the design of the complete communication system (modulations, network protocols, etc), carefully balancing modular/layered approaches and cross-layer approaches. During the design, performance metrics describing efficiency and robustness should always be assessed, to avoid that this gets too much compromised by the security measures. Also, encryption methods should be considered in order to obtain metrics about its efficiency. Different encryption methods can be used depending on the mission state, data classification level, etc.</p><p>The suggested design solutions should be tested in a realistic environment in salt water.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table> <thead> <tr> <td><p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p><p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>(a)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(b)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(c)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(d)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(e)</p></td> <td><p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(f)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(g)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(h)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(i)</p></td> <td><p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul><li>Integrating knowledge: <ul><li>Security techniques integrated or working in tandem with the underwater communication systems, through encryption and/or other methods.

Member States and EDF Associated Countries (MS) have already used various types of MALE RPAS in recent operations to provide detection, identification and communication. MALE RPAS could also have a dual use potential.</p><p>The EU commonly agreed priorities underline the permanent need to track ships, aircraft and other systems across a wide area of airspace by means of interoperable unmanned surveillance systems capable of operating in all and adverse weather conditions and all types of environments, with assured data integrity. To operate in all types of operational environments, RPAS must be integrated into air traffic management (ATM).</p><p>As part of a versatile and robust MALE RPAS, the system should consider the option to incorporate the means for an effective neutralisation of targets that posed a threat to the mission being carried out.</p><p>Today, most of the ISR capabilities of the MS rely on non-EU manufacturers in order to carry out their missions. However, due to the sensitive nature of military operations and the restrictions on technology transfer that prevent MS and EDF Associated Countries from fully benefiting from platform adaptation, the development of a fully European MALE RPAS is key to reduce dependency on non-EU solutions and to ensure sovereignty in this area of ISTAR.</p><p>It is an overarching objective to strengthen European sovereignty in this strategically relevant area. Hence, this topic is expected to result in a step-changing programme in line with the commonly agreed EU defence objectives and ensuring European strategic autonomy and technological competitiveness in a broad sense.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>MALE RPAS reconnaissance includes optical, infrared, radar and signal intelligence sensors and generates geoinformation data. The sensors for optical, infrared and radar reconnaissance are usual configuration parts of a MALE system. As signal intelligence is often classified for national eyes only, it would be preferable to develop a common pod design, which is suitable to contain the national electronics. The integration effort into the MALE system can be shared with a common pod design. This pod design is also a suitable baseline for additional future sensors.</p><p>The ultimate objective is to develop, produce and sustain a system that provides this critical defence capability to respond to future security challenges.</p><p>In addition, a strong European supply chain is intended to be developed at all levels to promote the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB) in the long term. The supply chain should not be a pre-determined black box, but is expected to be open to competitive suppliers in a largely open tendering process, with the suppliers for mission-critical or security-relevant systems intended to be EU-based.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address a prototype of a fully European MALE RPAS with an innovative ISTAR and armed ISTAR capability to exceed the capabilities of comparable current systems and the capabilities of systems available at the entry into service time or, at least, be comparable with them. The prototype must be tested with a view to further qualification and certification activities.</p><p>Proposals must also address the design and prototype of a common sensor pod for the European MALE RPAS, without affecting the timeline of ongoing activities related to the development of MALE RPAS.</p><p>In addition, proposals should address the enhancement of a multi-role approach for the MALE RPAS available with different sensor pod configurations.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic,

Military rotorcraft act like workhorses of the battlefield, performing a variety of missions such as armed reconnaissance, strike, combat, combat and ordinary search-and-rescue (SAR), MEDical EVACuation (MEDEVAC), CASualty EVACuation (CASEVAC), utility, air assault and close aerial support, all of which are critical to the success of military operations.</p><p>After decades of European involvement in counter-insurgency type of operations, recent conflicts have marked the return of high-intensity confrontations very close to European Union territory, recalling that although military helicopters are key assets, they require careful mission planning and operations to be efficient and survivable.</p><p>On the longer term, rotorcraft is foreseen to be even more critical as future combat theatres are likely to take place in congested urban environment, mostly in littoral regions, and to involve a wide range of long-range strike capabilities (artillery, short range ballistic missiles) combined with a shortened OODA loop made possible by the massive global deployment of networked C4ISR assets.</p><p>Current capability forecast assessments at European and NATO levels show that the helicopter fleets will have to be renewed as of 2035-2040. The main objective is therefore to provide the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries with a European solution that meets the European market and military needs in the field of rotorcraft.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic is intended to lead to a step improvement in EU VTOL capability with a view to future EU/NATO rotorcraft programmes (EIS 2035/2040+).

Military medical training based on both computer-generated, hybrid and physical teaching materials creates advantage to development of cost-effective training courses for the military and civilian medical (support) personnel population and paramedics.</p><p>European Union has already started its efforts for developing military medics' innovative training solutions, focused on Field Care and Role 1 scenarios. In order to take full advantage of military medics training simulation, additional operational scenarios and functionalities in a virtual reality environment have to be developed and integrated into a network of federated toolbox which provides interconnection and joint access to simulation systems that are supporting different but mutually complementing simulation methods like mixed, augmented, hybrid, part task trainers, logistics, manikins and medical equipment, but currently are unevenly distributed in the European market for the medical personnel and paramedic training.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The topic aims to address the current operational challenges facing military medical personnel in the EU Member States (MS) and EDF Associated Countries, including in and out of areas of deployment.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address the development of a prototyped solution for a federation of available and enhanced medical simulation systems that support military medical curriculum and are connected to a (at best AI-based) feedback system (that may include real medical and health-data as benchmarking) that enables to see integrated picture of all training related information.</p><p>Proposals must therefore address:</p><ul><li><strong>Medical Training Modules</strong>: The Medical Training Modules are designed to impart knowledge in military medicine to trainees. At present, the guidelines are anchored in Tactical Combat Casualty Care, serving as vital training curricula for both medical and non-medical personnel in civilian and military contexts. Looking ahead to future battlefield situations, insights from Ukraine underscore the importance of updating existing guidelines with a Prolonged Casualty Care environments. This adaptation is essential in preparing Europeans to confront diverse battlefield scenarios. Training modules can provide realistic, scenario-based learning experiences covering trauma, infections, and radiation exposure. They extend across various environments, including battlefield tranches, vehicles, and aircraft, offering comprehensive multi-modal and interdisciplinary training. The integration of virtual and mixed technologies elevates the delivery of educational content and learning retention. The overarching focus is effective communication, coordination, and preparedness for non-medical professionals in dynamic settings of the battlefield.</li><li><strong>Supporting elements enabling Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network</strong>: The Military Medical Training Multi-Modular Simulation Federated network employs advanced technologies to create a comprehensive and realistic training environment. This includes cloud-based solutions for simultaneous management of large casualties, integration of digital computer simulated casualties for dynamic scenarios, physical simulated patients for hands-on training, and physical manikin systems replicating human responses. Crucially, seamless data exchange between computer-generated simulations and physical systems ensures a cohesive training experience. The interconnected federated network allows collaborative exercises across different locations, with real-time monitoring and feedback enhancing the learning process. Scalability, customisation, and integration of virtual, mixed, and augmented reality technologies contribute to an immersive and adaptable training platform for military non-medical and medical professionals.</li><li><strong>Integration with Real World</strong>: The integration of 5G technology into medical education signifies a transformative approach for European Union medical training centres. This integration facilitates the delivery of educational content with high-speed, low-latency connectivity, enabling real-time and immersive learning experiences. Learning analytics tools add a data-driven dimension, offering insights into individual and collective learning patterns. Augmented reality serves as a powerful teaching aid, particularly for Definitive Surgical Trauma Care, enhancing trainees' understanding through virtual overlays in the real-world environment. This comprehensive integration fosters scalable and distributed training solutions, promotes remote collaboration, and ensures standardisation and quality assurance across diverse training centres.

Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.</p><p>In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.</p><p>The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today's military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.</p><p>A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.</p><p>The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.</p><p>Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.</p><p>The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:</p><p><u>1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States </u></p><p>The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.</p><p><u>2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services </u></p><p>The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.</p><p><u>3/ Flexibility and scalability </u></p><p>The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.</p><p><u>4/ Innovation </u></p><p>The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.</p><p><u>5/ Security and resilience </u></p><p>The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address system prototyping of the baseband equipment (satellite modem), the on-board satellite active transponder and ancillary systems, as well as

EDF-2024-DA-UWW-AHMS,Autonomous heavy minesweeping system,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-20T00:00:00,2024-11-05T17:00:00,,30000000,30000000,,46905571,46905561EDFDevelopmentActions1718841600000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>Uncrewed systems are a familiar asset in naval capabilities, and they are being increasingly adopted. These types of assets and the technologies that go with them have the potential to offer a diverse mission set, minesweeping being one of them. The maritime drones and their payloads currently used and integrated by the navies operate with different levels of autonomy and endurance. This topic aims to enhance naval minesweeping capabilities by pushing the design and level of the autonomy of particularly maritime drones. Furthermore, this topic addresses sweep gear and sweep sources for minesweeping operations adjoining the higher level of autonomy. In this context the drone/platform and its payload/sweeping gear form the minesweeping system.</p><p>Minesweeping is traditionally performed using mechanical or influence sweep sources towed behind a highly specialised and expensive crewed platform (minesweeper). Evolving technologies, such as autonomous features, offer new solutions to the minesweeping systems. These solutions in concert with new operational concepts offer European navies the opportunity to maximise the benefits of common development. Typically, a distinction can be made between drones with towed signature sources and those with integrated sources installed aboard.</p><p>The size and capability of a minesweeping drone and its payload are defined by the operational needs. These needs vary in environmental aspects from inshore operations with short transit and limited operation times in sheltered areas to operations in unsheltered areas potentially exposed to heavy wind and large waves with long standoff distances. The variation in operational needs with respect to the subject of protection can be from smaller merchant vessels and military vessels with reduced underwater signatures to large civilian merchants with significant underwater signatures.</p><p>The underwater signature and the shock resistance of the minesweeping system is a crucial part of its design and a fundamental feature of minesweeping operations.</p><p>The objective of this call is to reach at least technology readiness level 6 for a minesweeping system (platform/drone and payload designed for it).</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The proposals must target minesweeping systems (platform/drone and payload/sweeping gear) with autonomous features that are capable of performing influence sweeping in open-sea conditions against mines that target large merchant vessels (such as Landing Platform Dock (LPD), Ro-Ro vessels etc. up to around 200m length). The proposals must investigate and develop capable and cost-effective drone systems for influence minesweeping. This includes the interfaces to enabling systems such as launch and recovery (LARS) of the sweep system and command and control (C2) systems (including planning and evaluation tools).</p><p>The proposals may include solutions that include modified mechanical minesweeping operations.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposals must address reducing time (improved effectiveness) and risk for personnel and materiel in minesweeping operations. Development of uncrewed systems and autonomous features are seen as enablers in this regard. Improvements must address at least vehicle design regarding underwater signatures, propulsion system, and shock resistance to benefit both operational quality and efficiency. Improvements should also address features such as low maintenance effort, survivability, endurance, and modularity.</p><p>The proposals should address multi-purpose functions with the aim of supporting additional Naval Warfare operations, such as, but not limited to, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), and Maritime Evacuation Operations. This may imply that features, such as, but not limited to, LARS, interaction with several autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), operation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments, towing of sonar systems, and use of mine disposal systems are incorporated.</p><p>The outcome should benefit a European interoperable and interchangeable NMCM Future Sweeping System designed with incremental capabilities to counter current and new mine threats consisting of enhanced intelligent platforms. Furthermore, the outcome should address the development of influence sweep source demonstrators for relevant underwater signatures (such as acoustic, magnetic, pressure and electric).</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table> <thead> <tr> <td><p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p><p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>(a)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(b)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(c)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(d)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(e)</p></td> <td><p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(f)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(g)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(h)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(i)</p></td> <td><p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul><li>Studies: <ul><li>Research and studies on relevant signature levels, characteristic and frequencies as well as sweep tactics.</li><li>Defining the sweep signatures in the acoustic, magnetic, pressure and electric field.

However, predicting such effects currently involves a large uncertainty due to the difficulty in estimating the relevant characteristics of these structures. There is therefore a need to efficiently estimate such characteristics from available data such as imagery or documentation and to combine them with effect prediction models to provide reliable predictions. During operations, this should be performed in a limited time and possibly with limited available computing power. This is especially important for relatively large urban areas including many structures.</p><p>Software solutions for automated structural modelling and effect prediction should therefore be developed. They should offer the best possible accuracy, and trust should be ensured in the measurement of their performances. Given the complexity of the task, they need to rely not only on physics-based models but also on artificial intelligence, and they should be evaluated in an objective manner on data that is representative of the targeted use cases. This involves the collection and annotation of representative data. In order to ensure the reproducibility of experiments and for economic reasons, it is important that such data is reusable for similar developments, including by other technology developers. It also involves the testing of systems on new data using documented metrics and testing protocols, in a way that ensures comparability with similar systems developed by such other actors.</p><p>Models for the prediction of effects of weapons on structures are often used in conjunction with other models in decision support tools, for example to estimate freedom of manoeuvre or effectiveness of communication. Scalability and compatibility with such other models and tools should therefore be ensured.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address the development and evaluation of software systems for modelling structures from multisource imagery and other relevant available data, and for accurately predicting the effects of weapons on these structures.

Notable examples, such as OpenAI's GPT-4V and META's Llama 2 or DinoV2, have demonstrated a wide and growing variety of capabilities.</p><p>The swift progression of large AI models in recent years holds immense potential to revolutionize various industries, due to their ability to adapt to diverse tasks and domains. For them to achieve their potential, access to vast data repositories, significant computing resources, and skilled engineers is required. A promising avenue of research is the development of multi-modal large AI models that can seamlessly integrate multiple modalities, including text, structured data, computer code, visual or audio media, robotics or IoT sensors, and remote sensing data.</p><p>This topic centres around the development of innovative multimodal large AI models, covering both the training of foundation models and their subsequent fine-tuning. These models should show superior capabilities across a wide array of down-stream tasks. The emphasis is both on integrating new input data modalities into large AI models and on developing multimodal large AI models with either significantly higher capabilities and/or the ability to handle a greater number of modalities.</p><p>Moreover, projects should contribute to reinforcing Europe's research excellence in the field of large AI models by driving substantial scientific progress and innovation in key large AI areas. This includes the development of novel methods for pretraining multimodal foundation models. Additionally, novel approaches to effective and efficient fine-tuning of such models should be pursued.</p><p>Research activities should explore innovative methodologies for enhancing the representation, alignment, and interaction among the different data modalities, thereby substantially improving the overall performance and trustworthiness of these models. Advances in efficient computation for the pre-training, execution and fine-tuning of foundation models to reduce their computational and environmental impact, and increasing the safety of models are also topics of interest.</p><p>Proposals should outline how the models will incorporate trustworthiness, considering factors such as explainability, security, and privacy in line with provisions in the upcoming Artificial Intelligence Act. Additionally, the models should incorporate characteristics that align with European values, and provide improved multilingual capabilities, where relevant.</p><p>Proposals should address at least one of the following focus areas:</p><ul><li>the integration of innovative modalities of data for large AI models during training and inference. Examples of innovative modalities include event streams, structured data and sensor measurements. The incorporation of such new modalities could potentially bring unforeseen enhancements to model performance and enable their application in new domains like weather forecasting, robotics, and manufacturing.</li><li>enhanced multimodal models that exceed the current state of the art, with either significantly improved capabilities or the ability to handle a larger number of modalities.

The proposal should describe convincingly the characteristics and availability of the large, trustworthy data sources, as well as the trustworthy data<em></em>processing to be utilised within the project, detailing the data processing steps to ensure reliability, accountability and transparency, and the alignment of data among the different modalities. A modest portion (up to 10%) of the budget may be allocated to data collection activities; proposals may involve relevant data owners in this task, if necessary. Importantly, the proposal should delineate how potential privacy and IPR issues associated with the data will be managed and mitigated.</li><li>Multimodal Foundation Model Pretraining. The pretrained multimodal foundation model is expected to demonstrate high capabilities across a wide range of tasks. The pretraining tasks used should be agnostic of down-stream tasks. These activities also cover the development of the codebase and implementation of small-scale experiments. A minor portion (up to 10%) of the budget may be allocated for the acquisition of computing resources for codebase development and small-scale experiments, though the primary source of computing resources for pretraining should be sought from external high-performance computing facilities such as EuroHPC or National centres. The proposal should describe convincingly the strategy to access these computing resources.</li><li>Fine-Tuning of Multimodal Foundation Models: The proposal should clearly detail the activities pursued to fine-tune the model for diverse downstream tasks demonstrating illustrative potential use-cases. The tasks' output may either be of a single modality or multimodality. Research activities should investigate innovative methodologies designed to bolster the interplay between different data modalities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of these models.</li><li>Testing and Evaluation: The proposal should detail the development of workflows, benchmarks, testing procedures, and pertinent tools for evaluating both foundation and fine-tuned models. Attention should be paid to the performance, transparency, bias, robustness, accuracy, and security of the models, through appropriate testing procedures (e.g., red teaming for safety and security), in compliance with the future AI Act.</li></ul><p>Proposals should adopt a multidisciplinary research team, as appropriate, to cover all the above issues.</p><p>Proposals should adhere to Horizon Europe's guidelines regarding Open Science practices as well as the FAIR data principles.

The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.</p><p>The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.</p><p>In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:</p><ul><li>Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027).</li><li><p>Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes.</p></li></ul><p>The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.</p><p>In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&amp;I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.</p><p>The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.</p><p>It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.</p><p>Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>Leadership in AI based on trust</li></ul><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.</p><p>Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.</p><p><strong>EIT Digital</strong> plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ?</p><ul><li>An Internet of Trust</li></ul><p>The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.</p><ul><li>eXtended Reality (XR)</li></ul><p>Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and condition</p><p>The objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.</p><ul><li>Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry.</li></ul><p>This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.</p><ul><li>Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies</li></ul><p>The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade?), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.</p><p>In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.</p><p>Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.</p><ul><li>European standards for industrial competitiveness</li></ul><p>The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.</p><p>Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.</p><p>Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&amp;I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.</p><p>Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.</p><ul><li>International cooperation</li></ul><p>The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.</p><p>Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&amp;I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.</p><p>Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&amp;I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation.

This will include concrete indicators, source of information at national and European level, as well as the identification of existing, and development of new, capacity tools to support the uptake of identified best practice uses of digital technologies in support of digital humanism. This work will notably feed the review of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and of the solemn declaration in 2026.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>A horizontal and holistic approach is needed for creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, prepared and responsive to opportunities, societal changes, threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing protection and high-quality public services such as health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions.</p><p>While digital technologies bring strong advantages coming along with a promise of freedom and innovation, negative aspects have also become visible in the last years. These include the monopolization of the information space, increasing levels of fake news and disinformation, strong power of online platforms, cyber threats and crimes, privacy breaches, strong market disparities as well as an economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for commercial practices of extraction, prediction and sales (Zuboff, 2019).</p><p>Digital Humanism is here defined as the continuing search for a European answer to keep up high civilization standards stemming from enlightenment and the humanist era, and to further develop them in the digital world. In line with European values, such a digital environment should enable all Europeans to make full use of digital and technologies, to have a society where geographical distance matters less, so that all Europeans can benefit from the digitalisation in their daily activities (ranging from work, learning, to enjoying culture or leisure activities) but also in their interactions with governments, and participation in democratic processes.</p><p>This requires intense, cross-disciplinary work of computer (and technology) sciences with legal, economic, sociological, philosophical and other kinds of expertise as a co-development exercise. To support in-depth, early-on collaboration between computer sciences and the whole wealth of humanities and social sciences to put new algorithms and models into a broader context, proposals under this topic should:</p><ul><li>Support the development of cross-disciplinary communities and networks in relation to digital transformation of society. It is thus critical to foster greater exchanges between social sciences and technological communities.</li><li>Support the cross-disciplinary co-development of new theoretical models and approaches of the impact of digital technologies in our societies, starting with human and societal needs.</li><li>Showcasing success stories and examples of engagement of the digital community seeking to develop concrete ways to progress toward a more human-centred digital world and draw concrete conclusions from these.</li><li>Mapping out collaborative research to develop concrete tools and frameworks for ensuring that all actors of the European digital ecosystem (policy makers, business, startup developers, investors, NGOs) can integrate in their work and activities the values that form a human centred digital transformation and develop a roadmap for the possible development of research activities</li><li>Develop a conceptual framework as well as tools and indicators to monitor and promote the progress of the 'declaration on digital rights and principles' and its six chapters (putting people at the centre of the digital transformation; solidarity and inclusion; freedom of choice; participation in the digital public space; safety, security and empowerment; sustainability), notably to feed the review of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and of the solemn declaration in 2026.</li></ul><p>This project is also relevant in the policy context of the Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade?), which sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership. For the first time, societal and human centred objectives are fully integrated into a comprehensive governance mechanism at EU level including monitoring of the progress made by the digital transformation in reaching our collective values and quantitative digital targets (skills, infrastructures, digitalisation of business and public services).</p>",,"<p>This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li><strong>KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, </strong>prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions</li></ul><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:</p><ul><li><strong>A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies</strong>, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation.</li></ul><p>As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions, workers, regions, and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations, and will be differently affected by these changes, creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development, but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.</p><p>The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.</p><p>In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:</p><ul><li>Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027).</li><li><p>Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes.</p></li></ul><p>The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.</p><p>In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&amp;I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.</p><p>The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation.

The proposal will also include actions, including development of tools and materials, to promote education on ICT standardisation;</li></ul><p>The proposal should take into account the previous activities carried out the observatory and facilities for funding experts within the topics ICT-40-2017 implemented by the StandICT.eu project and ICT-45-2020 implemented under StandICT.eu2023 project (see <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.standict.eu/"">http://www.standict.eu</a>).</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is strongly encouraged.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p> <p>Such us ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC JTC1, ITU-T, 3GPP, IETF, OneM2M, W3C, OASIS, IEEE</p>",,"<p>This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li><strong>KSO D, Creating a more resilient, inclusive and democratic European society, </strong>prepared and responsive to threats and disasters, addressing inequalities and providing high-quality health care, and empowering all citizens to act in the green and digital transitions</li></ul><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the following expected impact:</p><ul><li><strong>A human-centred and ethical development of digital and industrial technologies</strong>, through a two-way engagement in the development of technologies, empowering end-users and workers, and supporting social innovation.</li></ul><p>As Europe takes the lead in the green and digital transitions, workers, regions, and societies are faced with extremely fast transformations, and will be differently affected by these changes, creating opportunities for inclusive technological and social development, but also carrying the risk of increased inequalities. The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.</p><p>The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.</p><p>In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:</p><ul><li>Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027).</li><li><p>Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes.</p></li></ul><p>The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.</p><p>In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&amp;I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.</p><p>The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.</p><p>It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.</p><p>Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>Leadership in AI based on trust</li></ul><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.</p><p>Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.</p><p><strong>EIT Digital</strong> plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ?</p><ul><li>An Internet of Trust</li></ul><p>The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.</p><ul><li>eXtended Reality (XR)</li></ul><p>Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and condition</p><p>The objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.</p><ul><li>Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry.</li></ul><p>This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.</p><ul><li>Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies</li></ul><p>The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade?), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.</p><p>In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.</p><p>Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.</p><ul><li>European standards for industrial competitiveness</li></ul><p>The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.</p><p>Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.</p><p>Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&amp;I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.</p><p>Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.</p><ul><li>International cooperation</li></ul><p>The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.</p><p>Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&amp;I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.</p><p>Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&amp;I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020</a>]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment).

For example, the vulnerability of IoT devices may be exploited by criminals who seek to collect personal data, compromise user credentials or spy on organisations or people. Furthermore, IoT devices may represent a threat that goes beyond the digital world, i.e. they may become an increasingly physical threat, since they find applications in, e.g., industry and infrastructure, as well as in building smart cities. Malevolent actions against connected devices with direct physical impact (e.g. car-to-car communication, hacking of vehicles, hospitals, nuclear plants) are also a growing concern.</p><p>Therefore, the successful proposal should help Police Authorities understand the implications of the fast-developing IoT environment in order to keep pace with the evolution of its applications, recognise and tackle the emerging (digital and especially physical) threats that this may pose.</p><p>At the same time, IoT proliferation will provide opportunities for the Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners to collect a new range of data in relation with criminal activities.

Undermining the fundamental values of the EU, such as respect for human dignity, freedom and equality. Under EU law, racist and xenophobic hate motivated crime and speech are illegal. The Framework Decision on combating certain forms of expressions of racism and xenophobia requires the criminalisation of public incitement to violence or hatred based on race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. The Commission's policies address also specific forms of hate speech and hate crime against groups and communities (e.g., antisemitism, anti-Muslim hatred or anti-gypsyism, hate speech and hate crime relating to gender and sexual orientation. In 2021, the European Commission adopted a Communication which prompts a Council decision to extend the current list of EU crimes in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to all forms of hate crime and hate speech. Since 2016, the Commission's efforts in countering hate speech and hate crime also involve dedicated exchanges and tools in support to national authorities in the context of the High Level Group on combating hate speech and hate crime.</p><p>Addressing hate speech from all angles increases the chance of combating it in a sustainable manner. Thus, in line with all the above initiatives and with the Victims Rights Directive and the EU Strategy on Victims' Rights, the successful proposal is expected to reinforce hate crime training and capacity building for Police Authorities and other relevant security practitioners, in particular to enhance their tools and methods for lawful detection, reporting and data/evidence collection and analysis of the hate speech related activities that are considered as crime or could lead to a crime, notably the ones supported by advanced digital technologies, such as in emerging cyber environments. By doing so, being an innovation action, the successful proposal is expected to build on previously developed tools for related applications (such as text and image matching). The successful proposal should also support the implementation of the voluntary Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online that the European Commission initiated in 2016 with IT companies, the European strategy for a better internet for kids, the Digital Services Act and the outcomes of the ""Study on digital violent right-wing extremist content and manifestations of hate speech online?. Similarly, any other relevant development, study or initiative should be taken into account. Evolutions in hate crime and hate speech, such as their sparks in times of social or economic crises (e.g. pandemics and wars) should be considered too. In order to derive effective responses and improve the understanding of the cultural and societal aspects of hate speech and hate crime, as well as of the key challenges for combating it, the successful proposal should include local, national and international dimensions, civil society perspectives, and analysis of good practices. An added value of the proposal would be to also develop modern and effective awareness raising campaigns for relevant Civil Society Organisations and Police Authorities in order to pass key messages to potential victims, as well as wide communities, while taking into account European multicultural dimension.</p><p>The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects, including the ones funded under topics: HORIZON-CL3-2021-FCT-01-03: <em>Disinformation and fake news are combated and trust in the digital world is raised</em>), HORIZON-CL2-2021-DEMOCRACY-01-03: <em>Feminisms for a new age of democracy</em>, HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-04: <em>Education for democracy</em>, HORIZON-CL2-2022-DEMOCRACY-01-05: <em>Evolution of political extremism and its influence on contemporary social and political dialogue</em> and HORIZON-CL2-2022-TRANSFORMATIONS-01-08: <em>Strengthening racial, ethnic and religious equality</em>.

These include market fragmentation, cultural barriers, analytical weaknesses, programming weaknesses, ethical, legal and societal considerations or lack of synergies between funding instruments, among others.</p><p>It is worth noting that such factors affect all the security domains addressed in Cluster 3; that there is not one predominant factor with sufficient leverage by itself to change the overall innovation uptake dynamics; and that they exhibit complex relationships among them which are difficult to disentangle. It should also be noted that the innovation uptake process starts before the R&amp;I cycle is triggered, and it is not finalised with the successful termination of a research project. Therefore, the uptake challenge extends beyond the realm of R&amp;I. However, from within R&amp;I it is possible, if not to materialise the uptake in every case, at least to pave the way towards its materialisation.</p><p>To that aim, there is a need to create a favourable environment that is designed with the main purpose of increasing the impact of security R&amp;I, that is visible and recognisable to those interested in contributing to this aim, and which provides bespoke tools that serve to tackle the factors that hinder innovation uptake.</p><p>The SSRI Destination has therefore been designed with this purpose to serve equally to all the expected impacts of Cluster 3. Research applied in this domain will contribute to increasing the impact of the work carried out in the EU security Research and Innovation ecosystem as a whole and to contribute to its core values, namely: i) Ensuring that security R&amp;I maintains the focus on the potential final use of its outcomes; ii) Contributing to a forward-looking planning of EU security capabilities; iii) Ensuring the development of security technologies that are socially acceptable; iv) Paving the way to the industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and deployment of successful R&amp;I outcomes; and v) Safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>While the other Destinations of this Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme offer research and innovation activities to develop solutions to address specific security threats or capability needs, the SSRI Destination will trigger actions that will help bringing these and other developments closer to the market, thus contributing to the measures facilitating the uptake of innovation described in the Commission staff working document on security research. Those actions will help developers (including industry, research organisations and academia) to accelerate product development and improve the valorisation of their research investment. They will also support buyers and users in materialising the uptake of innovation and further develop their security capabilities.</p><p>In addition, the SSRI Destination will offer an open environment to create knowledge and value through research in matters (including technology, but also social sciences and humanities) that are not exclusive of only one security area, but cross-cutting to the whole Cluster. This will contribute to reducing thematic fragmentation, bringing closer together the actors from different security domains, and expanding the market beyond traditional thematic silos.</p><p>Finally, SSRI will allow the allocation of resources to the development of tools and methods to reinforce the innovation cycle itself from a process standpoint, thus increasing its effectiveness, efficiency and impact. This Destination will contribute to the development of the tailored analytical capacity required for the adoption of capability-driven approaches, in line with the provisions of the Action Plan on synergies between civil, defence and aerospace industries[[COM(2021) 70.]] and with the measures set out in the Commission staff working document on security research aimed at fostering a forward-looking capability-driven approach in security.</p><p>In order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following impacts:</p><ul><li>A more effective and efficient evidence and knowledge-based development of EU civil security capabilities built on a stronger, more systematic and analysis-intensive security research and innovation cycle;</li><li>Increased cooperation between demand and supply market actors, including with actors from other domains, fosters swift industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of successful outcomes of security research and reinforces the competitiveness and resilience of EU security technology and industrial base and safeguards the security of supply of EU-products in critical security areas;</li><li>R&amp;I-enabled knowledge and value in cross-cutting matters reduces sector specific bias and breaks thematic silos that impede the proliferation of common security solutions. </li></ul><p>Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.</p>",,,

For example, the initial effects from a nuclear explosion in a city will lead to, besides numerous dead and severely injured citizens, destroyed infrastructure. The radioactive plume containing particulate matter may damage ventilation systems and fallout will generate high dose rates. Criticality or other incidents at nuclear power plants and nuclear-powered vessels may occur because of direct attack, sabotage, collateral damage, accidents, loss of infrastructure services such as power and/or water supply or lack of necessary skilled personnel on site. </p><p>Research on large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion need to be undertaken both separately as well as in a RN-perspective. Research activities aimed at updating EU's possibilities for large-scale protection of population and infrastructure in the event of a nuclear explosion would benefit from being carried out in close cooperation with other EU-members. Research activities should also pertain to improved understanding of the radioactive fallout and assessment of dose rates to the population following a nuclear explosion in order to enable use of cost-effective sustainable technologies in protection of population and infrastructures.</p><p>In a situation after a RN-incident the time consuming and laborious decontamination procedures for the population must be reduced to a minimum. Therefore, the possibility to identifying the need for decontamination, and above all to assess that there is no need for decontamination would be beneficial as well as the possibility to enter a shelter or other protected area in a safe way.</p><p>Protective measures in the aftermath of a RN disaster may vary depending on situations. Such measures should be based on evaluated risks rather than probabilities. Starting with sensor- as well as other available data, measures could be optimized from a risk-cost point-of-view resulting in cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Based on measurement data, appropriate protective actions could be decided upon. If a risk analysis results in a low risk, a lower level of mitigating measures might be needed resulting in lower costs. Then resources can be used in other areas where they are more needed, leading to an overall optimized protection.</p><p>Protective actions should be based on risk modelling. Such modelling is based on available knowledge of different input quantities resulting in a probability distribution, from which the risk can be calculated applying a consequence function.</p><p>New technologies should be compatible with RN crisis management systems, strategies for crisis communication and take into account relevant societal and human factors, such as vulnerable group and cultural and linguistic diversities. In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. The action should take due consideration to EU policies, in particular the SevesoIII and CER Directives.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research/innovation activities.</p><p>Within this topic, the European Commission encourages all potential participants to create, where possible, opportunities for the affected persons and entities, in particular researchers and innovators previously active in Ukraine as well as Ukrainian researchers and innovators who are unable to return to Ukraine in the given circumstances.</p> <span>Specific Topic Conditions</span>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-8 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.</p></p>",,"<p>Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to primarily make use of Copernicus data, services and technologies.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged also to coordinate with ESA relevant activities, especially those undertaken under the Science for Society element of the FutureEO programme (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eo4society.esa.int"">https://eo4society.esa.int</a>).

This pool of experts includes experts in digitalisation and green engineering who accompany applicants by coaching and mentoring them. This enables Partners to implement the coaching and mentoring services (CMS) by supporting companies in the strategic design and implementation of new and innovative digital and green approaches, technologies, business models, and ensuring a successful implementation. The pool of experts is expected to grow steadily during the project lifetime.</p><p>The applicant SME, start-ups, VSB may contact one or more experts either from the list available on the submission platform: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://clustersubmissionplatform.eu/service-providers-resist/"">https://clustersubmissionplatform.eu/service-providers-resist/</a>and the ECCP or propose an expert outside the list and invite them to submit an offer for the respective coaching and mentoring service, and finally selects one expert.

It is one of the Common European Data Spaces envisioned by the EU Data Strategy and works closely with the Data Spaces Support Centre (DSSC), especially on cross-sectorial aspects such as minimal interoperability.&nbsp;</p><p>The pilots will provide feedback from practice as more firm guidance is put into regulatory instruments, such as requirements for procurement, operation, and reporting, starting from a baseline of high-value datasets to add value by using data from different domains and models. This initiative aims to foster innovation towards a more resilient Europe, supporting local businesses and ecosystems, and emphasising ethical considerations and AI-enabled local solutions, thereby enhancing the conditions for citizens and communities across Europe.</p><p><strong><u>Who Can Apply</u></strong></p><p>The pilot call is specifically designed for local public administrations in the EU and Digital Europe Programme (DEP) Associated countries and partners working with them (e.g., companies, civil society organisations, academia). The consortia must be capable of executing a cross-sectorial and cross-border pilot activity, and co-finance at least 50% of the pilot activity.</p><p><strong><u>Consortia Eligibility Criteria</u></strong></p><ol><li><span></span>Eligible consortia must consist of at least two local or regional public administrations from different EU member states and/or DEP Associated countries, promoting cross-sectoral collaboration and dealing with the European Green Deal objectives.</li><li><span></span>The local administrations can also involve other eligible parties working with them (e.g., companies, academia, civil society organisations and others).&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>The pilot consortium members are subject to restrictions due to security reasons. Entities must not be controlled by an ineligible country. If there is a risk for such case, entities will be offered an opportunity to provide a guarantee. </li><li><span></span>All entities (except entities that are validated as public bodies by the EU countries) have to fill in and submit an Ownership Control Declaration (OCD). OCD must be self-declared at proposal time, and if the pilot is awarded, the official OCD must be provided within <strong>14 days</strong> from the notification date.<strong></strong>If a chosen pilot consortium member is found, after assessment, to be controlled by a partner from a non-EU country, they will need to present a guarantee that will be assessed to allow or exclude participation in the pilot project. If a partner is found to be controlled by a DEP-associated country, they will also have to prepare a guarantee that will need to be assessed to allow or not allow their participation in the pilot.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Scope</u></strong></p><p>The pilot consortia must create new data services from the data sharing across at least two areas specified below, but can also include other European Green Deal domains:</p><ol><li><span></span>predictive traffic management/sustainable mobility planning, establishing also synergies with the mobility data space and making use of the Sustainable Urban Mobility Indicators, where appropriate;&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>data-services related to weather, climate and extreme weather events to facilitate risk prevention, disaster resilience as well as climate change adaptation;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>management of energy flows in a city/community specific context and in conjunction with other sectors;&nbsp;</li><li><span></span>zero pollution actions (e.g., air, water, soil pollution or waste);</li><li><span></span>and any other domain falling under the New European Bauhaus initiative (urban design, building management, public services, nature-based solutions, amongst others.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Available funding and Co-Financing</u></strong></p><p>Each pilot is planned to be funded with 1 to 1� million euros by EU contribution to share amongst the consortium members of the pilot. If justified, this can also be less than 1 million euro. The funding should be balanced proportionally amongst the pilot sites, and one partner can receive a maximum of 1 million euro as grant (this also applies when applying for more than one pilot or in following open call rounds). The total EU contribution for the DS4SSCC-DEP pilots is 15.3 million euros, which is planned to be distributed to around 12 chosen pilot consortiums.</p><p>The financial criteria for applicants involves a co-funding model. Applicants are expected to bear at least 50% of the project costs, as direct co-financing. This means that for any pilot proposed, the grant will cover only up to half of the total expenses. Applicants must directly indicate the co-financing as a dedicated cost in the budget for the pilot and demonstrate their capacity to provide it through their own resources. To be eligible, co-financing cannot include in-kind resources not explicitly monetized in the pilot budget, and all activities must observe relevant regulation, including state-aid rules and risks of double funding. As normally, all costs need to be actual, incurred during the pilot period time-frame and have to be auditable.</p><p>This approach ensures shared investment and commitment from both the funding body (EU) and the applicants, aligning with the principles of partnership and joint responsibility. The model is designed to encourage meaningful participation and investment in the project, ensuring that the applicants are equally invested in the success and sustainability of their initiatives. It's crucial for applicants to clearly articulate their funding strategy and show their ability to meet these financial requirements in their application.</p><p>The piloting consortium is expected to receive 50% of the total grant at the start, upon signing of the grant agreement, and the remaining 50% will be paid out in two instalments against actual performance, evaluated during midterm and final reporting period.&nbsp;</p><p>For more information about the Financial Framework, please refer to the Call for Pilots Manual at <u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ds4sscc.eu/cfp-one"">https://ds4sscc.eu/cfp-one</a></u></p><p><strong><u>Additional information</u></strong></p><p>We strongly recommend participants to get acquainted with the preparatory action and the established DS4SSCC data space blueprint (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://inventory.ds4sscc.eu/"">https://inventory.ds4sscc.eu/</a>), as it serves as the foundation for proposed solutions and describes the specific requirements that pilots need to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>We invite applicants to be part of the Stakeholder Forum to engage and network with likeminded organisations aiming to realise the objectives for Data Space for Smart Communities.

They <strong>shape</strong> society and significantly impact our lives in almost every aspect. Mobile devices like phones and tablets in particular have become pervasive: they are our <em>gateway</em> to the world at large, function as an <em>external brain</em> and are increasingly part of even our most <em>intimate</em> moments.</p><p>People should therefore be far more <strong>empowered</strong> when it comes to such a critical dependency. Even a mere user should be able to dive under the surface and learn more about the underlying layers of the technologies they depend on. Software and hardware should be open, transparent and reusable. This facilitates <em>reuse</em>, <em>exchange</em> and <em>collaboration</em> between developers and suppliers, but it is also a necessary requirement for consumers and organisations to make <strong>conscious choices</strong> about which technologies to use and which ones to avoid, and to start thinking about how together we shape technology rather than the other way around. If we want everyone to use and benefit from the internet to its full potential without holding back, the internet <em>must</em> be built on strong and transparent technologies that allow for permissionless innovation and are equally accessible to all.</p><p><strong>Mobifree</strong> is a pilot programme designed to push beyond the status quo of mobile software, and create a virtuous cycle of innovation through <em>free and open source software</em>, <em>libre hardware</em> and <em>open standards</em>.

Free and open source <strong>software</strong> and <strong>hardware</strong>, open <strong>standards</strong>, open <strong>data & AI</strong>, open <strong>science</strong>, <strong>creative commons</strong> and open <strong>educational resources</strong> are democratising innovation and learning, and are together driving society and industry forward at an unprecedented pace. But it is also obvious that there are major gaps that need to be fixed still. The answer to market failure and dystopian runaway technology lies in <strong>collective action</strong> and <strong>public investment</strong>.</p><p>This is where <strong>NGI Zero Commons Fund</strong> come into play. The goal of this new fund is to help deliver, mature and scale <strong>new internet commons</strong> across the whole technology spectrum, from libre silicon to middleware, from P2P infrastructure to convenient end user applications. We have a <strong>holistic</strong>, <strong>full-stack approach</strong>, simply because there is no other way. If we want to reclaim the public nature of the internet and yield the full benefits from technology as a society, we need to have full coverage ? period.</p><p>Only though enough critical mass of <strong>shared building blocks</strong> and <strong>collective resources</strong> will our governments, businesses and civil society be able to secure their security and long term operational availability. The same approach that empowers individuals to take full control of their digital lives, will also steer towards more fair, innovative economies and societies. So let's make it happen!</p><p>The changes we want to see are vast, and there is much technical debt to resolve as well. We are looking for <strong>troubleshooters</strong> that help society tackle the hard but very very important challenges ahead. Ultimately we believe in the power of the <strong>quadruple helix</strong> ? the collaboration of the public sector, aligned companies, academia and civil society ? to restore the internet (and our economies) back to health. Together we can create a strong and open internet for all, and bring about new paradigms like the European Commissions vision for <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/virtual-worlds-and-web-40-factsheet"">Web 4.0</a> which aim to harness upcoming techologies like <em>virtual and augmented reality</em>, <em>generative AI</em> and <em>intelligent mediators</em> in a responsible way so they may sustainably serve society.</p><p>We need <strong>new ideas</strong> and <strong>disruptive technologies</strong>, while at the same time <strong>evolving</strong> and <strong>growing</strong> existing technologies that are still future-proof.</p><p>Have a look at <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroPET.html"">other</a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroDiscovery.html"">NGI</a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGI0Entrust.html"">Zero </a><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nlnet.nl/thema/NGIZeroCore.html"">programmes</a> to see the kind of efforts we mean, but don't be afraid to send something completely different if you think you can contribute to the topic ? it really is an open call.</p><p>Project results always become available under a free or open source license, so anyone can read and validate the source code, and anyone can use the code or open data to create solutions that fits their own purposes.

These experts are appointed from the pool of experts identified through an open call and contracted by the coordinator as part of the NetZeroCities project. The experts from this pool are deployed against all Calls for Pilot Cities and the call for Enabling City Transformation interventions. This evaluation is made using sub-criteria grouped into the three main categories of: <strong>Mandate to Act</strong>, <strong>Capacity to Act</strong>, and <strong>Impact</strong>.</p><p>The detailed criteria for assessment of proposals for the SGA-NZC Enabling City Transformation programme's financial support to third parties scheme is defined in section <strong><em>5.3</em></strong>of the Call Guidelines.</p><p><strong>Stage 3: Strategic Portfolio Selection</strong></p><p>The selection committee will select a portfolio of interventions through a dedicated selection process. The portfolio will be selected with the intention to support Mission Cities to overcome challenges to, experimenting with, and learning about, the implementation phase of the Cities Mission: i.e. enabling (Cities) Mission innovation implementation. It will also aim at complementing the existing cohorts of Pilot Cities (i.e. inter-cohort portfolio) selected through previous calls, creating opportunities to exploit learning and outcomes of these diverse interventions over the course of the programme.</p><p>The selection of the interventions to be supported through the subgrants will build on the review by independent external experts and the scores noted in Stage 2.</p><p>All submissions will be assessed fairly and transparently in the scope of the eligibility criteria, assessment of quality criteria, and strategic programme considerations as outlined in section <strong><em>5.4</em></strong><strong><em>of the Call Guidelines</em></strong>.

This financial support will be provided in the form of grants against the payment of services offered by Sustainability Experts, customized to each awarded SME. The grant will be paid by the COASTOUR consortium directly to the SME, who in turn will pay the service provider himself. Any services exceeding the agreed grant amount (maximum ?9,000) will be covered by the SME. It will also be possible for the SME to choose service providers by themselves, or choose from the list of available providers on the project homepage: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eu-norddanmark.dk/about-coastour/"">https://eu-norddanmark.dk/about-coastour/</a></p><p>Service providers chosen by the SMEs will be compared, based on price, technical competence and quality of service, with at least two other similar service providers to ensure the highest possible value-for-money in the grants awarded. The COASTOUR consortium in this regard retains the right to refuse service providers suggested by the SMEs, and to recommend alternatives. To track the progress of the SMEs, all SMEs will also be evaluated by the developed sustainability monitoring tool at the beginning of the implementation period and the end of it.</p><p>The customized support services under Phase 2 aim to enhance sustainability strategies and practices related to sustainable tourism for the SMEs involved, providing direct support to at least 80 tourism SMEs selected through Calls I and II. Direct support will be provided to enhance the sustainability, resilience, cooperation, and competitiveness of the SMEs.</p><p>The period from receiving a grant under Call II to implementation is 8 months (October 2024 to May 2025).</p><p><u>Step 2: Capacity Building - Sustainability advisor services</u></p><p>SMEs not receiving financial support grants via Call I and II will still be able to benefit from free-of-charge sustainability advisory services such as a one-on-one assessment and/or participation in workshops. Such SMEs will however only be able to consult the certified Enterprise Europe Network sustainability advisors which will be communicated to them by the consortium at a later stage.</p><p>SMEs not receiving support grants during the Call I process are eligible to apply again for the financial support grant, as part of this Call.</p><p><u>Step 3: Self-assessment sustainability monitoring tool</u></p><p>SMEs receiving financial support grants will be assessing and measuring their sustainability performance via a sustainability monitoring tool, with support from the COASTOUR consortium. The assessment will measure the sustainability performance of SMEs before the commencement of their sustainability journeys, and again at the end of their journeys, to highlight the changes and improvements made.</p><p><strong>Eligible Activities and Costs for Financial Grant Support</strong></p><p>Only activities that have been confirmed based on the application and implemented after the information letter on the grant and within the agreed implementation period are eligible.

Consortia applying for this open call should be able to demonstrate that they are active in one of the EU Missions described below.</p><p>European Missions are part of the European Union's Horizon Europe program, designed to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing our world. These missions aim to deliver concrete results by 2030, focusing on areas crucial for the future well-being of Europe and the planet. The five main missions are:</p><ol><li><span></span><strong>Adaptation to Climate Change</strong>: Aiming to support at least 150 European regions and communities to become climate resilient by 2030, through tailored solutions and transformative strategies.</li><li><span></span><strong>Cancer</strong>: Seeking to improve the lives of more than 3 million people by 2030 through better prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and support systems, as well as reducing inequalities in cancer care across Europe.</li><li><span></span><strong>Restore our Ocean and Waters:</strong> Focused on restoring the health of oceans, seas, and waters by combating pollution, promoting sustainable blue economy practices, and protecting biodiversity by 2030.</li><li><span></span><strong>Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities:</strong> Aiming to create 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030, serving as hubs for experimentation and innovation for other cities to follow.</li><li><span></span><strong>Soil Health and Food:</strong> Striving to ensure that at least 75% of soils in the EU are healthy for food, people, nature, and climate by 2030, emphasizing sustainable farming and land management practices.</li></ol><p>Multi-stakeholder engagement, including citizens, is a cornerstone of the European Missions, reflecting a commitment to democracy, inclusivity, and collective action in addressing major societal challenges. The European Union recognizes that involving citizens directly in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the Missions not only enhances their effectiveness but also fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among the public. By actively engaging different stakeholders and societal actors, including citizens, the EU Missions aim to harness diverse perspectives, ensure transparency, and build trust, ultimately leading to more sustainable and impactful solutions.</p><p><strong>Specific challenges</strong></p><p>Three specific challenges to be addressed have been identified for this Incubator Open Call:</p><ol><li><span></span><strong>Lack of knowledge and experience in multi-stakeholder engagement </strong>presents a significant hurdle in the successful execution of EU Missions.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to work with the right stakeholders on common solutions to achieve the EU Missions.</li><li><span></span><strong>Ensuring inclusion and diversity in citizen engagement for EU Missions </strong>poses significant challenges, as it requires reaching and involving a wide spectrum of individuals from different backgrounds, ages, socio-economic statuses, and geographic locations. Marginalised and underrepresented groups, often face barriers to participation.</li></ol><p>Applicants may apply for one or more of the listed challenges or address other specific topics for which they have identified a gap in introducing multi-stakeholder engagement approaches in R&amp;I processes in the context of the EU Missions and justify the selection in the application process.</p><p>Some examples of specific activities that can be proposed for the potential projects to be funded are included below.

In order to make the green and digital transitions fair and inclusive, institutions and territories need to shift to more open and transparent R&I practices in which all actors share responsibility to develop services and products that are acceptable, sustainable and bring social satisfaction.</p><p>The Open and Responsible Research and Innovation (ORRI) approach promotes collaborative efforts. From sharing research outputs as early as possible to engaging citizens in co-creation processes, R&amp;I should be open to the whole society. </p><p>Implementing ORRI can seem a daunting task. Over the past decade, many resources and tools have been created, but an effort to systematize, curate and create a single entry-point was still missing. REINFORCING is this much-needed European central hub for Open and Responsible R&amp;I. The project's platform is the entry point to knowledge, training, ORRI skills match-making and capacity building for organizations interested in starting or continuing their journey to creating an inclusive R&amp;I ecosystem. Furthermore, the project brokers unique networking opportunities for organizations, institutions and territories interested in becoming part of the European ecosystem that is transforming the R&amp;I system by bringing it closer to society and societal needs.</p><p>To support this change, REINFORCING has ring-fenced funding for 96 grants to invite institutions from around Europe to develop projects aiming at implementing new modes of doing R&amp;I that drive more just transitions.</p><p><strong>Call requirements and details</strong></p><ol><li><span></span>The consortium should include at least 2 entities based in EU countries (Member State or associated country), including their outermost regions or associated countries eligible to receive HEU grants, provided that the applicants are not covered by the Council sanctions in force.

Booster</p><p>? Education (PhD Education, Master Education, Lifelong Education, Wider Society Learning)</p><p>? Upscaling</p><p>? Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS)</p><p>As a rule, the maximum amount of EIT funding allocated to each project will not exceed ? 500,000. Project funding in excess of ? 500,000 may be considered in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>Any funds received through this call will be counted in the maximum yearly funding available to the different Partner categories.</p><p>In line with current EIT and EIT RawMaterials strategy, financial sustainability for the KIC will be an important factor in the selection process.</p><p><strong>1. Eligibility criteria</strong></p><p>Eligibility to apply for this call is restricted to ongoing projects and start-ups that have been allocated EIT funding in 2024.</p><p>The following activities are eligible for support:</p><ol><li><span></span>Increase in scope of the project (hereafter referred to 'XXX.PLUS' projects, where 'XXX' refers to the acronym of the existing project): activities that will lead to a demonstrated and quantifiable increased impact of the project in terms of additional/higher KPIs (see Appendix 1).</li><li><span></span>Speed-up the launch of a product to the market (hereafter referred to 'XXX.SPEED' projects, where 'XXX' refers to the acronym of the existing project): activities that will accelerate the launch of a product/service to the market. These activities are specifically aimed at recently finished or ongoing Upscaling and Lifelong Learning (LLL) projects with good performance (to be demonstrated by the consortium in the proposal), but in need of 1) additional funding to launch their products/services to the market, or 2) a commercialisation partner.</li></ol><p>As a general rule, the same principles described in the most recent KAVA 12 Call apply, including provisions for financial backflow to the KIC. Note the following:</p><p>i) The Lead partner must be the same Lead partner of the current related KAVA project.</p><p>ii) Minimum 30% co-funding applies to Upscaling and RIS Acceleration projects.</p><p>iii) Minimum 10% co-funding applies to Education projects.</p><p>iv) No co-funding is required for RIS Education RIS M&N projects, however any co-funding contributed by the consortium will be evaluated positively.</p><p>v) Only the costs of existing (at the time of proposal submission) EIT RawMaterials Core, Associate and Project Partners will be considered. Non-members (entities that that are not current Partners of EIT RawMaterials) are eligible to apply, however, they must become Partner of EIT RawMaterials by the time of the project start (see point 5. below)2. RIS Task Partners will be considered only if they are based in the RIS region and the project is in the RIS category.</p><p>vi) Funding eligibility is subject to the same rules and conditions applied by EIT and EIT RawMaterials in the most recent KAVA and Booster calls. Within these rules, the decision to fund specific costs will be to the sole discretion of EIT RawMaterials.</p><p>vii) Funding will not be awarded to compensate for funding reductions requested in 2024 or in previous years.</p><p><strong>2. Other conditions and information</strong></p><p>i) Note that due to time constraints, no-pre-financing from EIT RawMaterials can be guaranteed, therefore Consortia must be able and willing to cover their costs until EIT RawMaterials funds are received.</p><p>ii) Project Agreements (PA) cannot be issued unless the Amended Business Plan 2024 is signed by EIT and EIT RawMaterials. Therefore, Consortia need to be able to start projects without having PAs in place.</p><p>iii) The changes will be made in BlueBook in the existing related KAVAs.</p><p>iv) All the funds awarded in this call must be fully expended by 31 December 2025.</p><p>v) All the activities supported in this call must be fully completed by 31 December 2025.</p><p><strong>3. Selection criteria</strong></p><p>Proposals will be evaluated by EIT RawMaterials using the criteria listed below. Based on the evaluations and the overall available funding, the EIT RawMaterials Management will rank the proposals and select the project portfolio. The total maximum score for a project is 75 (3 criteria, each with a maximum score of 5, and weights of 7, 4 and 4, respectively).</p><p>In addition to the eligibility criteria listed in Section 1, the following criteria will apply:</p><p>1. Strategic importance to the KIC, including impact; Weight: 7</p><p>Description of criteria</p><p>? Economic importance of the targeted theme/market</p><p>? Contribution to the overall EIT RawMaterials strategic objectives</p><p>? Financial backflow to EIT RawMaterials</p><p>? Contribution to core EIT KPIs</p><p>2. Performance and compliance with EIT RawMaterials feedback; Weight 4</p><p>Description of criteria</p><p>Overall performance of the related existing project to date and compliance with EIT and EIT RawMaterials requests and guidelines</p><p>3. Quality and impact of the specific activities to be carried out in 2024 and 2025, Weight 4</p><p>Description of criteria</p><p>? Definition of aims, objectives and deliverables and their relevance to EIT RawMaterials</p><p>? Demonstration of the project's added value in terms of promoting entrepreneurship and innovation</p><p>? Details of how the funds are to be used for in the form of a clear budget plan and timeline with justification</p><p>? Realistic assessment of the expected contribution that the project will make to the impact of the KIC in relation to the requested budget</p><p>Evaluation scale: In relation to each of the criteria above, the score ranges from 0 to 5 according to the following scale:</p><p>0: Non-existent: no relevant information provided in the application file or cannot be judged because out of range</p><p>1: Very poor: The criterion is addressed in a very incomplete and unsatisfactory manner</p><p>2: Poor: There are serious weaknesses in relation to the criterion in question</p><p>3: Fair: While the proposal addresses the criterion, there are significant weaknesses that would need correction</p><p>4: Good: The proposal addresses the criterion well, although some improvements are possible</p><p>5: Excellent: The proposal successfully addresses all relevant aspects of the criterion in question. Any shortcomings are minor only.</p><p>Coordinators of projects that are selected for funding will be informed after approval by the EIT RawMaterials Management. Project Coordinators will be responsible for making the relevant changes and updates in BlueBook.</p><p><strong>4. Confidentiality</strong></p><p>Access to the project proposals might be given to EIT and EIT RawMaterials staff members for evaluation, management and reporting reasons. Public dissemination will be arranged in agreement with partners of the project consortium and the EIT RawMaterials staff.</p><p><strong>5. Proposal submission and funding announcement</strong></p><p>Proposals must be submitted via SeedBook no later than Friday 18 October, 2024 at 13:00 CET. Evaluation will commence after monthly cut-offs (19 August eob, 19 September eob) during the call period, and the outcomes of the evaluation will be communicated to the Partners within two weeks after the respective cut-off. Projects can start on or after 1 September, 1 October or 1 November 2024, respectively. All costs must be incurred, and all activities must be completed by 31 December 2025.</p><p>The level of any available pre-financing of a project will be announced together with the notification of acceptance of the project. Questions can be directed to Compliance@eitrawmaterials.eu.</p><p><strong>6. Appeal and redress procedure</strong></p><p>Upon reception of the feedback, the applicant may wish to lodge a request for redress, if there is a concern that there might have been a shortcoming in the way a proposal was evaluated, or if the results of the eligibility checks are incorrect. The redress procedure is not meant to call into question the judgement made by the evaluators. It will consider only procedural shortcomings and factual errors.</p><p>Requests for redress should be raised within one month of the reception of the evaluation feedback sent by EIT RawMaterials, and should be sent to Compliance@eitrawmaterials.eu. Requests must:</p><p>? be related to the evaluation process, or eligibility checks;</p><p>? include a clear description of the grounds for the complaint;</p><p>? be received within the time limit specified above.</p><p>An initial reply will be sent to complainants no later than two weeks after the deadline for redress requests. This initial reply will indicate when a definitive reply will be provided. A redress committee of EIT RawMaterials may be convened to examine the evaluation process for the case under consideration. The committee's role is to ensure a coherent interpretation of requests, and equal treatment of applicants. The redress committee itself, however, does not re-evaluate the proposal. Depending on the nature of the complaint, the committee may review the evaluation report and the individual comments made by the evaluators. Following its review, the committee will recommend a course of action to the EIT RawMaterials Management. If there is clear evidence of a shortcoming that could affect the funding decision, it is possible that all or part of the proposal may be re-evaluated. Unless there is clear evidence of a shortcoming there will be no follow-up or re-evaluation. The Executive Board of EIT RawMaterials will be informed of any redress procedures in due course.</p><p>Please note:</p><p>? This procedure is concerned with the evaluation and/or eligibility checking process.</p><p>? The committee will not call into question the judgment of the individual evaluators, whose qualifications have been already assessed and validated.</p><p>? A re-evaluation will only be carried out if there is evidence of a shortcoming that affects the quality assessment of a proposal. This means e.g. that a problem relating to one evaluation criterion will not lead to a re-evaluation if a proposal has failed anyway on the other criteria.</p>",,3 months

Border practitioners in some Member States are assessing feasibility, reliability and acceptability of optimised border controls using risk-based management.</p><p>The solution(s) proposed under this topic should allow easier and more flexible allocation and change of resources in border checks, for example to meet seasonal peaks. A possible use case is that of roll-on-roll-off ferries. That situation may generate long queues for border and security checks, while often being seasonal. A proposed solution should help perform border checks, as well improve the speed for detecting threats in vehicles, such as weapons and explosives, without people coming out of vehicles and without slowing down (dis)embarkment off or onto roll-on-roll-off ferries.</p><p>In any case, the proposed solution(s) should consider both the travellers and the goods accompanying them.</p><p>Higher leveraging of risk management in border crossing practices has the potential to also decrease and minimise the use of personal data and the risk for violating fundamental rights. The project should integrate strong ethical, legal and acceptability assessment to ensure that, on the other hand, the risks of bias (such as on ethnicity or gender) and discrimination of risk mitigation is minimised.</p><p>Collaboration with international stakeholders in the field of transport and transport safety in the air, maritime and rail contexts is encouraged.</p><p>Should the project deliver on its goal and be compatible with applicable legislation, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research with the support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).</p><p>The proposed system should ensure secure data collection, access, encryption, and decision support processes.

This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should expect a key role of Frontex in validating the project outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.</p><p>The involvement of Police Authorities is encouraged, as well as synergies with relevant topics of the Fight against Crime and Terrorism Destination.</p> <p>In the context of this Destination, 'Police Authorities' means public authorities explicitly designated by national law, or other entities legally mandated by the competent national authority, for the prevention, detection and/or investigation of terrorist offences or other criminal offences, specifically excluding police academies, forensic institutes, training facilities as well as border and customs authorities.</p>",,"<p>This Destination addresses, among other, objectives identified by the <strong>Security Union Strategy</strong>[[COM(2020) 795 final.]]<strong></strong>as well as the border management and security dimensions of the <strong>New Pact on Migration and Asylum</strong>[[COM(2020) 609 final.]]<strong></strong>and the<strong> Strategy on the Schengen Area</strong>[[COM(2021) 277 final.]]<strong>.</strong> As such, topics included under the Destination aim at ensuring strong European land, air and sea external borders. This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).</p><p>The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.</p><p>Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.</p><p>This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.</p><p>Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf</a>]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN</a>]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.</p><p>Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research &amp;

To respond to these emerging challenges an integrated transnational emergency management is needed efficiently linking systems available at the European level such as, for example, the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, with national, regional or local systems. Furthermore, an evaluation of applied disaster risk reduction methods is required, in particular alert and impact forecasting systems, to identify potential for improvement and constant innovation.</p><p>Knowledge transfer (cross-border and cross-sectoral) about natural hazards-related risks and emergency management is essential to increase the resilience of societies. A vital dialogue and exchange of good practice examples among scientific and technical communities, stakeholders, policymakers and local communities is needed. In particular, the level of awareness of EU citizens for local risks can be increased by new approaches to visualise risks, vulnerability and exposure through e.g. impact forecasting data and mapping including satellite data and information. Emergency management plays a crucial role in this regard, taking into account the ongoing urbanization and economic growth, which put a lot of pressure on areas such as floodplains and their ability to absorb and store water.</p><p>Currently, there are no harmonised / standardised European methods for identifying vulnerability and exposure on the basis of which alert and impact forecasting systems are established, allowing this information to be used by civil protection authorities in a timely manner to improve disaster preparedness, communication to local authorities and population, evaluation logistics etc. Recent flash floods in Belgium, Germany and Luxembourg in July 2021 have shown that this lack of protocols hampered the efficient implementation of early warning and preparedness actions prior to the disaster event.</p><p>This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the EC on Earth System Science.

Proposed research could include, for example, image (shape) recognition and interpretation, and/or a trace detection approach</p><p>On tracking, the research can propose and explore, for example, technologies for improved traceability of goods and items that could be illicitly trafficked using non-invasive markings.</p><p>On risk-based anticipation, the proposed solution(s) can leverage automated image recognition and interpretation capability coupled with data analytics, such as using advance cargo information in order to anticipate and detect security risks prior to goods' arrival at the EU external borders.</p><p>The research project can test one or more specific use cases, such as (non-exhaustive examples): art; cultural goods; waste and other environmentally risky material, including radioactive ones; valuables; and/or dangerous items either assembled or disassembled.</p><p>Improving energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of new security technologies for this capability (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.</p><p>Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): scanning (vision), detectors/?sniffers? (traces), nanotechnology, blockchain/DLT, artificial intelligence.</p><p>Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other recent EU Framework Programmes projects on security research.</p><p>Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals. The results of the research should be taken up by EU customs authorities in the framework of the Customs Union 'acting as one?, with the support of the Customs Control Equipment Instrument (CCEI).</p><p>The involvement of Police Authorities is encouraged, as well as synergies with relevant topics of the Fighting against Crime and Terrorism Destination.</p> <p>In the context of this Destination, 'Police Authorities' means public authorities explicitly designated by national law, or other entities legally mandated by the competent national authority, for the prevention, detection and/or investigation of terrorist offences or other criminal offences, specifically excluding police academies, forensic institutes, training facilities as well as border and customs authorities.</p>",,"<p>This Destination addresses, among other, objectives identified by the <strong>Security Union Strategy</strong>[[COM(2020) 795 final.]]<strong></strong>as well as the border management and security dimensions of the <strong>New Pact on Migration and Asylum</strong>[[COM(2020) 609 final.]]<strong></strong>and the<strong> Strategy on the Schengen Area</strong>[[COM(2021) 277 final.]]<strong>.</strong> As such, topics included under the Destination aim at ensuring strong European land, air and sea external borders. This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).</p><p>The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.</p><p>Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.</p><p>This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.</p><p>Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf</a>]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN</a>]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.</p><p>Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research &amp;

This should be done under the premises of feed and food as a critical infrastructure and risks pertaining therein;</li><li>In addition to raising awareness, proposals should develop possible preparedness, mitigation and response plans for national authorities and the private sector. </li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Plant and animal health is of global importance for sustainable agriculture and competitive agriculture and forestry, as well as for the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. Globally, between 10 and 28 percent of crop production is lost to pests and contamination of food and feed by mycotoxins can severely threaten the health of humans and livestock. The International Year of Plant Health (IYPH) 2020, established by the United Nations, raised public and political awareness of the importance of plant health and a recent study (IPPC, 2021) calls the attention of policy makers to the main effects of climate change on plant health, helping governments and the international community addressing plant health challenges. Also, the food chain, from harvest of agricultural products, throughout processing, distribution and until consumption can be challenged by several (hybrid) threats, which are increasingly taking non-conventional forms and possibly targeting the agriculture and food chain with severe consequences.</p><p>The Word Health Organisation identified intentional agriculture attack with biological weapons and food contamination as one of the main global public health threats of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. The potential for terrorist attacks or other criminal actions against agri-food targets is increasingly recognised as a threat to international security. The population's health could be jeopardised by the manipulation of communicable diseases or the contamination of food, soil, air and drinking water by CBR agents. These risks have been studied and documented by a Network of excellence (Plant and Food Biosecurity) funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (PLANTFOODSEC).</p><p>In 2017, the ENVI Committee (Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of the EU Parliament) has defined food defence as <em>'the protection of food from intentional contamination or adulteration by biological, chemical, physical or radiological agents. It includes measures regarding prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery form intentional acts of food contamination?. </em>The potential impact on human health of deliberate sabotage of agricultural crops, seed or food can be estimated by extrapolation from the many documented examples of unintentional outbreaks of foodborne disease.</p><p>Current EU capabilities to detect and respond to agro-terrorism and bio-criminal acts are dispersed across different national practitioners, normally handled by regional or national bodies and are very limited in terms of coordination. Different countries have different governmental authorities for agricultural and feed and food domains, different collaborative networks, different border controls, different inspection bodies and different regulatory references and reporting mechanisms as well as different investigative bodies in the case of suspected feed/food crime. The EU institutions have to start to consider the agri-food chain as a critical infrastructure which can suffer from attacks and which need to be protected. The most effective way to accomplish this goal is through international cooperation by a multi-sectorial approach combing different expertise, such as from law enforcement, the feed and food sector and health emergency services.</p><p>The main challenge is to increase the resilience of European agricultural production, feed and food processing and distribution chain in case of sudden shocks. Agriculture and food chains will be included as an important dimension to be analysed in the context of protection of European critical entities in case of emergencies. It is also crucial to address the interrelations between the food chain shocks and different types of critical entities with the objective of developing tools and methods to minimize cascading effects and allow rapid recovery of service performance levels after incidents. In the new context also the interaction with climate change, global trade and internet trade (spreading often plant material not controlled at all and of low quality) need to be taken into consideration. Artificial intelligence provides new tools for better coping with many of the most important challenges.</p><p>In this context, research should address agri-food systems shocks, taking account of the increasing effects of climate change and global trade (and their interaction) on pest outbreaks and spread, feed/food commodity shocks, due to external challenges, feed/food supply chains interruption and organised agri-food terrorism attacks.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is also encouraged.</p><p>Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic as well as with the successful proposal(s) under topic <em>HORIZON-MISS-2023-SOIL-01-02: Soil pollution processes - modelling and inclusion in advanced digital decision-support tools</em> should be envisaged to avoid duplication, and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p> <p>For R&amp;I on plant and animal health as well as on agro-biodiversity please consult further topics under the Cluster 6 Work Programme.</p><p>Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on the resilience of critical entities (COM(2020) 829 final.</p>",,"<p>Proposals involving earth observation are encouraged to primarily make use of Copernicus data, services and technologies.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged also to coordinate with ESA relevant activities, especially those undertaken under the Science for Society element of the FutureEO programme (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eo4society.esa.int"">https://eo4society.esa.int</a>).

It supports the Soil Mission specific objectives, in particular the following ones: 3 'No net soil sealing and increase the reuse of urban soils?, 4 'Reduce soil pollution and enhance restoration?, 5 'Prevent erosion?, and specific objective 8 'Increase soil literacy in society across Member States?.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&amp;I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.</li><li>Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.</li><li>Practice-oriented knowledge, tools and techniques are more easily available to urban communities, local city councils/regions and land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across across neighbourhood/communities, territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.</li><li>Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regards to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and green European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.</p><p>Nowadays, there are various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users . For the purpose of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', �soil health living labs are defined as 'user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption?.</p><p>Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level . Individual sites could be e.g., urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried-out and monitored under real-life conditions.</p><p>Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as 'places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement?. They are individual, local sites (one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.</p><p>According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context, applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites.</p><p>Urbanization is a challenge for soil health, due to construction and infrastructure development that entails, among other, land take, soil sealing, contamination or compaction. Against this background and by working together on common challenges, actors in living labs in urban areas will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies, benefit from cross-fertilisation, and connect with their local/regional ecosystem. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.</p><p>More specifically, each of the funded projects should:</p><ul><li>Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, if relevant) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s) faced by soils in urban areas (e.g., sealing, contamination, fertility, erosion, compaction, etc.) while increasing the overall resilience of urban areas. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission's specific objectives . Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, land uses, Mission objectives addressed).</li><li>Establish, based on the projects' goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s) identified, taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed strategies and solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Where relevant, regeneration of soil health or repurpose of soils on urban areas to provide locally sourced fresh and healthy food to local food services (e.g., canteens, restaurants, food trucks, markets, etc.) and citizens should be considered.</li><li>Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf"">Soil Mission Implementation Plan</a> and the descriptors of the proposal for a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en"">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a>.</li><li>Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators. In particular, for living labs working on soil sealing, identify urban-specific monitoring methods in connection to the work developed by Copernicus and for the functional and ecological impacts of the soil sealing process.</li><li>Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.</li><li>Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes.</li></ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement a multi-actor approach. The list of stakeholders will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and should involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public authorities (e.g., administrators responsible for green spaces (such as parks, gardens and urban farms), urban planners, schools, and representatives of civil society (e.g., citizens, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, based on their areas of expertise.

However, soil-derived gaseous nitrogen emissions from agriculture are often overlooked due to challenges in monitoring. A comprehensive assessment of both gaseous and non-gaseous nitrogen losses, including their geographical distribution and varying temporal resolution, is essential to inform effective greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategies and encourage the adoption of higher Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) tiers at the national level.</p><p>Nitrogen losses are highly episodic, and the current temporal and spatial resolution of information regarding nitrogen dynamics across Europe is insufficient for a comprehensive estimation of the full nitrogen budget at a continental scale. The most commonly used methodology for measuring N-flux involves discontinuous flux measurements accompanied by standard gap-filling methods, which lead to large uncertainties and biased emission factors. Additionally, most existing observations focus on temperate zones and single flux exit pathways, neglecting the full spectrum of nitrogen forms, including both gaseous and non-gaseous forms across different climatic conditions. Data and observations are particularly lacking in the Mediterranean basin and some nitrogen transformation pathways are not well investigated. For example, widely used modelling approaches estimate the reduction of N<sub>2</sub>O to N<sub>2</sub> by applying a conversion factor developed in laboratory conditions that do not comprehensively represent the vast array of soil types found in Europe. These ratios are subject to bias associated with the use of linear rates for nonlinear dynamics. To address these gaps, accurate information must be acquired, which will facilitate the development of effective management strategies that effectively minimise total nitrogen losses from soil. Additionally, this information will improve the parameterization and validation of models and increase the confidence of model predictions when scaled to the continental level. This will ultimately lead to a more refined and accurate estimation of nitrogen surplus, enrich existing dashboard estimates, and further support the evaluation of the effectiveness of management strategies, and guide future research and policy decisions related to mitigation efforts.</p><p>Proposed activities should:</p><ul><li>Develop and employ advanced nitrogen monitoring and analytical techniques to generate high temporal resolution data on nitrogen fluxes and their drivers in various climatic conditions with particular focus on underrepresented pedo-climatic conditions.</li><li>Implement a coordinated, holistic approach to develop and evaluate robust, practical management strategies that effectively minimise total nitrogen losses from soils while addressing potential trade-offs with other environmental concerns, such as water quality and soil carbon preservation.</li><li>Utilise advanced modelling approaches to analyse the collected data, identify patterns and relationships between soil biogeochemical processes and nitrogen fluxes, and improve predictive tools that can be used to inform management strategies on a regional to continental scale.</li><li>Implement and monitor pilot projects that test the effectiveness of the developed management strategies in diverse pedo-climatic zones, accounting for local environmental conditions, agricultural practices both in conventional and organic farming systems, and socio-economic factors that may influence adoption and outcomes.</li><li>Synthesise the findings from field studies, modelling efforts, and pilot projects into a comprehensive estimation of the full nitrogen budget at the European continental scale contributing to the EU Soil Observatory through the provision of high-quality datasets for monitoring, reporting and verification.</li><li>Development of scenarios on how climate change and land use change will affect nitrogen cycling through the soil-plant-atmosphere system.</li></ul><p>Proposals should demonstrate a route towards open access, longevity, sustainability and interoperability of knowledge and outputs through close collaboration with the Joint Research Centre's EU Soil Observatory (EUSO) and the project Soil-WISE.

Fellowships are open to researchers of any nationality who wish to engage in R&amp;I projects by either coming to the EU from any country in the world or moving within the EU to a Widening Country.</p><p>In order to apply for the ERA Fellowships call, applicants must submit their proposal to the Marie Sk?odowska-Curie actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024. To be eligible to this call the host organisation must be located in an eligible Widening country. The application to the (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024 will be automatically resubmitted to this call in case the proposal fails to reach an adequate place in the ranking to be funded. This simplified submission procedure to the ERA Fellowships call presents applicants moving to Widening countries with an additional funding opportunity but there is the possibility to opt out during the application stage.</p><p>The proposals submitted under the ERA Fellowships must fulfil all the admissibility and eligibility conditions of the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowships 2024 and pass all the thresholds for that call.</p><p>ERA Fellowships will be implemented applying the award criteria, scoring and threshold for Marie Sk?odowska-Curie actions.

The secondment phase can be a single period or be divided into shorter mobility periods. Secondments cannot exceed one third of the standard fellowship duration and should be in line with the project objectives, adding significant value and impact to the fellowship.</p><p><em>Placements in the non-academic sector</em></p><p>ERA Fellowships can provide an additional period of up to six months to support researchers opting for a placement at the end of the project to work on R&amp;I projects in an organisation from the non-academic sector established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. While this possibility is also available to fellows recruited in the non-academic sector, such a placement should be implemented at a different non-academic host organisation established in an EU Member State or Horizon Europe Associated Country. The request for such a non-academic placement should be an integral part of the proposal, explaining the added value for the project and for the career development of the researcher, and will be subject to evaluation. This incentive aims at promoting career moves between sectors and organisations and thereby stimulate innovation and knowledge transfer while expanding career opportunities for researchers.</p><p><em>Training activities</em></p><p>The training activities implemented under the ERA Fellowships should include training for key transferable skills, foster innovation and entrepreneurship, (e.g., commercialisation of results, Intellectual Property Rights, communication, public engagement and citizen science), foster good scientific conduct such as research integrity and promote Open Science practices (open access to publications and to other research outputs, including data, FAIR data management, societal engagement and citizen science, etc.).</p><p><em>Career Development Plan</em></p><p>In order to equip ERA Fellows with skills that enhance and expand their career opportunities inside and outside academia, a Career Development Plan should be established jointly by the supervisor(s) and the researcher.

Activities will also support the proposed Carbon Removal Certification (CRC) Framework (including through collaboration with the Commission's Expert Group on Carbon Removals) , the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation , the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU Action Plan on the development of Organic Production, and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 on Climate action.</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>The confidence of stakeholders (including land managers) in participating in possible carbon farming certification schemes and the <strong>attractiveness of the carbon farming </strong><strong> business model</strong> are enhanced through <strong>better access to information and data</strong> regarding soil carbon (achievable sequestration and storage, risks of release, etc.). This should allow to improve soil management performance and mitigate the negative climate impact of activities in EU Member States and Associated Countries. </li><li>Reliable benchmarks or <strong>baselines</strong> for soil carbon at land management parcel level across the EU are established, with a view to providing financial rewards to those farmers and forest managers/owners who go beyond the baselines within the proposed framework for Carbon Removal Certification.</li><li><strong>Improved decision making in the LULUCF sector</strong> at the regional or national level thanks to enhanced quality of national GHG inventories and geographically explicit soil monitoring elements that reflect action at the individual level.</li><li><strong>Market situation and social dimension</strong> are better integrated into EU carbon farming policy, in particular as regards the impact of carbon farming incentives on rural development, farmers' and foresters' incomes, competitiveness, food security and land access. <strong>Business strategies and (digital) marketplaces</strong> for carbon farming, including a <strong>registry</strong> for carbon farming credits/certificates, support EU carbon farming policy.</li><li>Regulated EU carbon credits and environmental and financial <strong>incentives</strong>, within legal frameworks and for certified measures for carbon farming deployment strategies, specifically for foresters and agricultural land managers or owners, are supported. This should be aligned with the EU CRC Framework aiming at promoting carbon removal activities and fight greenwashing by encouraging forestry and agricultural sectors to act in this field and effectively demonstrate that carbon farming can be quantified<strong> through appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV</strong>) methods.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>With the European Commission's proposal for a first EU-wide voluntary framework to reliably certify high-quality carbon removals (<strong>Carbon Removal Certification</strong> -CRC- Framework) , the EU aims to boost sustainable carbon farming solutions by significantly improving Europe's capacity to quantify, monitor and verify carbon removals. Higher transparency will ensure trust from stakeholders and prevent greenwashing. The development of soil carbon removal deployment strategies and a robust and validated soil carbon <strong>monitoring system approach</strong>, <strong>at scale relevant for land managers</strong>, are therefore crucial. This system approach is currently underdeveloped and solid and reliable <strong>data for establishment of baselines</strong> for soil carbon at parcel level across Europe are missing. The system approach should further the potential for financial rewards to farmers and forest managers/owners who excel in their carbon farming practices, in line with the CRC Framework proposal. It should also lead to enhanced quality of <strong>national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories</strong> for the Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, as well as be relevant for the establishment of the database for the proposed <strong>EU Soil Monitoring Law</strong>.<strong></strong></p><p>To show the extent to which a carbon farming activity results in a positive climate impact, the European Commission will establish standardised <strong>baselines</strong> reflecting the standard performance of comparable activities in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances and geographical locations. This type of baselines ensures objectivity and transparency, minimises compliance costs and other administrative costs, and positively recognises the action of first movers who have already engaged in carbon farming activities. However, the geographically-explicit data needed to identify and set such <strong>standardised</strong><strong>baselines</strong> and help prioritise regions and actions for carbon farming is currently missing.</p><p>Moreover, it is important that the EU boosts sustainable carbon farming solutions by <strong>enabling a business model</strong> that financially rewards land managers for such activities, as stressed by the <strong>EU CRC Framework </strong>and the Commission's 2021 Communication on Sustainable Carbon Cycles. The EU CRC Framework aims to ensure that financial incentives from both private and public sources are channelled towards high-quality carbon removals and nature-based solutions. However, to ensure its correct functioning, <strong>interoperable public registries</strong> and MRV protocols compliant with standards and technical rules to be set out at EU level are needed. These will ensure transparency, full traceability of carbon farming certificates, an easily accessible marketplace for these certificates, and avoid fraud risk and double counting.</p><p>Proposed activities should:</p><ul><li>Develop, validate and apply pilot, innovative, robust, local soil carbon <strong>monitoring systems</strong> in line with the CRC Framework proposal, able to gather the data needed for the European Commission to set out standardised <strong>baselines</strong> reflecting the standard performance of comparable activities in similar social, economic, environmental and technological circumstances and geographical locations in Europe. These systems should also allow to evaluate achievable biophysical <strong>potential</strong> of carbon storage and related co-benefits of carbon farming activities, <strong>at land management parcel-scale </strong> and <strong>for the whole European territory</strong>, and help prioritise regions and actions for carbon farming.</li><li>Investigate and develop approaches and methodologies for <strong>soil </strong><strong></strong><strong>sampling</strong> pertinent to the granular level of the monitoring, including assessment and exploitation of the technological innovation opportunities and the potential to reduce monitoring costs.</li><li>Leverage the power of existing <strong>remote sensing</strong> tools such as those typically employed in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) control, i.e., in conjunction with spatially explicit parcel data (e.g., Land Parcel Identification System - Geospatial Application (LPIS-GSA)); and develop a structured, standardized system for understanding and managing the direct <strong>effect of </strong>carbon farming practices on soil carbon (including the practices promoted by the CAP).</li><li>Demonstrate and where possible expand the power of <strong>digital tools and technologies</strong> (including electronic databases and geographic information systems/geographically-explicit digital map data, remote sensing, artificial intelligence and machine learning) for (decreasing the costs of) the data collection, for establishing baselines and for the monitoring of carbon removal activities.</li><li>Deliver <strong>guidance</strong> (e.g. manuals) for policymakers and certification bodies on soil monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), data collection protocols, and baselines against which action is quantified. Such guidance should be designed within the upcoming EU CRC Framework and in consultation with the <strong>Commission's Expert Group on Carbon Removals.</strong></li><li>Develop and test <strong>harmonisation protocols within a distributed data management system</strong> for the integration and direct comparison of upcoming CRC data and existing spatially explicit information contained in national LULUCF inventories and other soil organic carbon datasets (such as LUCAS, and pertinent national datasets).</li><li>Develop a <strong>framework to collect and analyse data</strong> coming from certificates (both within existing voluntary carbon markets and the upcoming CRC Framework), to define reliable ranges of carbon sequestration and outliers, and consolidate interoperable, quality-checked datasets.</li><li>Use results of the above work to calibrate and <strong>validate modelling frameworks</strong> applicable to the monitoring methodologies mentioned above in this topic.</li><li>Create <strong>metrics to gauge carbon sensitivity</strong> to perturbations, particularly those linked with climate change, by analysing different soil carbon fractions.</li><li>Evaluate the <strong>permanency-related risks</strong> of release of carbon, using modelling scenarios.</li><li>Address key uncertainties and scientific knowledge <strong>gaps</strong> that currently exist within carbon removal quantification methods, helping to develop a <strong>standardised MRV approach</strong>.</li><li>Undertake an in-depth <strong>assessment of the market situation</strong> for carbon farming, building on existing and ongoing research, to assess the (expected) overall market impacts of carbon farming, including the potential income opportunities for farmers and other land managers, impacts on land productivity and land prices, and sensitivities over the 'commodification? of carbon removals and ecosystem services, <strong>for different carbon farming activities </strong>(e.g. agroforestry, rewetting of land and other practices).</li><li>Analyse the different <strong>channels and business strategies</strong> for the marketing of certified carbon removals, providing an overview of the current market and outlook for the next 10 years. This analysis should consider differences between marketing certified carbon removals <strong>within and outside the agri-food or forestry value chains</strong> and identify the relevant <strong>market players</strong> in each case.</li><li>Create a network among existing carbon farming schemes across several European countries and scale up their activities by developing <strong>an interoperable digital marketplace</strong>, based on a geographically-explicit <strong>registry</strong>, that provides easier access to the carbon farming units certified by those different schemes. This registry should follow the rules set out in the CRC Framework and be consistent with Member States' reporting in the LULUCF sector so as to enable Member States to improve their GHG inventory data. The registry should enable monetary transactions involving carbon credits, however the project(s) should not directly carry out such transactions.</li></ul><p>The '<strong>carbon farming'</strong> activities to be covered are those defined in the CRC Framework proposal. Whenever relevant, the <strong>synergies and</strong><strong>trade-offs between carbon and nitrogen</strong> and their possible optimisation should be covered. <strong>All types of land</strong>, including forests and their above-ground biomass, where relevant, should be covered. In the case of the agricultural sector, organic farming, as an approach with potential to increase carbon sequestration in the soil, should be included.</p><p><strong>Key information/data on soil carbon should be shared </strong><strong>with land managers</strong>, to enable them to learn from peers and facilitate access to tailored advice and certification services to improve their soil management performance and verify the mitigation impact of their activities in view of possible certification. Given the necessity for new ideas that meet social needs, create social relationships and form new collaborations within this topic's subject, proposals should integrate <strong>social innovation</strong>.</p><p>Proposals should include a dedicated task and appropriate resources to collaborate with other relevant forthcoming projects as well as to capitalise on activities and results from on-going, relevant projects.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[<sup></sup>In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/""><u>https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/</u></a>]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.</p><p>To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.</p><p>To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.</p><p>Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).</p><p>The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en</a>]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.</li><li>Land managers[[<sup></sup>The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.</li><li>A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.</li><li>'Soil literacy?, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.</li><li>More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.</li><li>The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).</li><li>The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[<u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en""><u><u><u>https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en</u></u></u></a></u>]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices.</li></ul><p>Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[<u></u><u><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ejpsoil.eu/"">https://ejpsoil.eu/</a></u></u>]]).</p><p><u>Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:</u></p><p>Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.</p><p>The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[<sup></sup>An'(end-) user? of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process.

Soil health is key to climate change adaptation and mitigation. Therefore, holistic systems approaches are needed for addressing multiple context specific soil health related challenges at country and regional level. In addition, evidence driven analytical framework is urgently needed for adequate soil health priority setting and planning at regional and national level, alignment of partners and investments.</p><p>Proposed activities should:</p><ul><li>Develop a scalable Africa-wide soil health dashboard, building on the experience of the EUSO Soil health dashboard, leveraging existing data (e.g., Africa Soil Information System AfSIS ) and other EU funded projects such as <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.soils4africa-h2020.eu/"">Soils 4 Africa</a>.</li><li>Strategic collection of new data to fill soil knowledge gaps (such as pollution, compaction, biodiversity, nutrient status, acidity/acidification, soil organic matter, soil erosion, soil water) and improve the accuracy and functionality of the dashboard through consultative engagement with national stakeholders.</li><li>Identify critical local/regional thresholds for key soil health descriptors.</li><li>Develop roadmaps to highlight trends in soil health responses to policy instruments.</li><li>Support participating African countries in the development of national soil health strategies in at least 8 countries, to better manage soil resources for agriculture and the environment.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[<sup></sup>In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/""><u>https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/</u></a>]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.</p><p>To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.</p><p>To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.</p><p>Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).</p><p>The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en</a>]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.</li><li>Land managers[[<sup></sup>The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.</li><li>A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.</li><li>'Soil literacy?, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.</li><li>More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.</li><li>The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).</li><li>The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[<u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en""><u><u><u>https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en</u></u></u></a></u>]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices.</li></ul><p>Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[<u></u><u><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ejpsoil.eu/"">https://ejpsoil.eu/</a></u></u>]]).</p><p><u>Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:</u></p><p>Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.</p><p>The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[<sup></sup>An'(end-) user? of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:</p><ul><li>How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.</li><li>How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.</li><li>How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge.

However, energy losses during the different steps (e.g., electricity production or thermochemical conversion) make the process highly energy intense. Also, the provision of affordable, renewable electricity at the needed scale is challenging. A potential workaround to this bottleneck is the development of devices which <u>directly convert </u>solar energy and abundantly available molecules (such as water or carbon oxides) into liquids and gases - within a single device. These so-called solar-to-X technologies avoid the beforehand conversion of solar energy into electricity and reduce the complexity of the process by a complete integration of the different steps. <strong>Solar</strong><strong>-to-X technologies, also called artificial photosynthesis or solar fuel technologies, support the vision of a decentralized, local energy and production system with </strong><strong>a local provision of the needed resources.</strong><strong> In this vision, communities become not only prosumers of electricity, but also of fuels, chemicals and materials.</strong></p><p>In this Challenge, solar-to-X technologies must address societal needs not already sufficiently covered by other energy technologies. The developed technologies should demonstrate how they can be embedded in the full functional value chain from generation to use, be self-sustaining in the long-run and provide a win-win opportunity for prosumers and the environment. <strong>The objective is to make progress towards synthetic fuels and chemicals</strong><strong> technologies which integrate all necessary conversion steps into a single device, and which are solely and directly driven by solar energy.</strong> Devices which are driven by electricity or heat are not the focus of this Challenge - except for radically new electrolyzer designs beyond incremental R&amp;D on mature electrolyzer designs. Partially integrated systems, where the overall balance of plant is not significantly simplified (e.g., PV-assisted photoelectrochemical devices) are not within the scope of this Challenge. The use of sacrificial agents has to be avoided and the desired product has to go beyond hydrogen and carbon monoxide. To summarize, this Challenge focusses on: i) Novel electrolyzer designs showing a significantly simplified balance-of-plant compared to mature electrolyzer designs; ii)Fully-integrated PV-EC devices, with electrochemical conversion (EC) and photovoltaic unit (PV) combined in a single device; iii)Photosynthetic devices converting directly sunlight and simple feedstock molecules into a fuel or chemical (e.g., Photoelectrochemical devices, Particulate systems, Biohybrid photosynthetic devices, Thermally-integrated photosynthetic devices, etc.); iv)Solar-driven biological conversion devices (e.g., solar cell factories).</p><p>This Challenge is directly relevant to the objectives of the European Green Deal and Repower EU.</p><p><strong>Specific objectives:</strong></p><p>Project proposals should address one (and only one) of the following three areas:</p><p><strong>Area 1: Standalone solar-to-X device development</strong></p><p>Projects should address <u>all of</u> the following specific objectives:</p><ul><li>Develop standalone solar-to-X devices, converting sunlight and simple, low-energy molecules such as water, carbon oxides or N<sub>2</sub> (non-exhaustive list) into fuels, chemicals and materials.</li><li>Enable simplified production chains where one directly goes from simple feedstock to complex products, beyond hydrogen or carbon monoxide.</li><li>Design solar-to-X systems that can operate independently, allowing communities and remote areas to have access to reliable and sustainable energy sources and a local production and utilization of chemicals and fuels.</li><li>The developed devices have to reach at least TRL 4 within a 3-4 year project runtime.</li></ul><p><strong>Area 2: Benchmarking and common metrics development for solar-to-X devices</strong></p><p>Projects should address <u>all of</u> the following specific objectives:</p><ul><li>Develop common metrics, protocols and equipment to enable a fair and standardized comparison between technologies within the same class, as well as between different technology classes in the field of solar-to-X (see Area 1 for the different technology categories).</li><li>Develop a holistic framework by identifying key performance indicators common to the different categories, while considering unique features of each category. It is required to develop metrics, protocols and equipment for multiple solar-to-X device architectures (aligned with Area 1).</li><li>Devices stemming from area 1 should serve as a portfolio-own testbed to validate the developed methodologies, protocols and equipment in practice. Standards for solar-to-X devices can (and should) build on existing ones.</li><li>Acceptance of the developed metrics and protocols by a broad range of stakeholders within the diverse research communities must be ensured from the beginning, by e.g., co-creation workshops, extensive outreach activities, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Area 3: </strong><strong>Understanding fundamental mechanisms by means of computational materials science</strong></p><p>Projects should address <u>all</u> the following specific objectives:</p><ul><li>Explore fundamental phenomena crucial to multiple device architectures to enable next-generation solar-to-X devices.</li><li>Drive forward the one-to-one comparison between theory at the atomistic level and experiment. Developing more accurate and less resource-demanding quantum mechanical methods is highly encouraged.</li><li>Bridge the scales from describing properties at the atomic, mesoscopic up to the macroscopic device level within a multiscale approach.</li><li>Adopt a holistic approach to exploring phenomena applicable to multiple solar-to-X device architectures (aligned with area 1). Devices stemming from area 1 should serve as a portfolio-own testbed to validate the developed theoretical models.</li></ul><p><strong>Expected outcomes and impacts:</strong></p><p>This Challenge addresses the development of devices - their enabling technologies and use cases - that store sunlight directly on the long term in the form of fuels and chemicals to enable a decentralized energy, transport and production system.</p><p>The <u>portfolio</u> of projects selected under this Challenge is expected to collectively:</p><ul><li>cover Areas 1,2 and 3: There is a strong need to go from the pure concept to next maturity level by developing devices running at elevated timeframes and efficiencies (Area 1). To ensure a fair and honest comparison between the developed devices, common metrics, key performance indicators and standardised protocols must be developed and tested (Area 2). At the same time, fundamental mechanisms that are common to the different device architectures are not fully understood and require dedicated exploration (Area 3).

Achieving sustainable ocean, water and land management, and using natural resources efficiently to help mitigate climate change implies finding the right balance between productivity, climate, biodiversity and environmental goals in the agriculture and forestry sectors, with a long-term perspective. R&amp;I activities will support <strong>solutions for climate and environmentally</strong><strong> friendly practices</strong> to reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases, other pollutants and the environmental impact of ocean and land use changes and agricultural activities. R&amp;I will rely on the application of digital technologies where relevant.</p><p>The <strong>EU climate law</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&amp;from=EN"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&amp;from=EN</a>]] states that to reach 2030 and 2050 climate targets and to restore biodiversity, the EU needs to immediately and decisively restore and increase its natural carbon sinks. In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend <strong>Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554</a>]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a <strong>communication on sustainable carbon cycles, </strong>including<strong> carbon farming </strong>and<strong> certification</strong><strong>of carbon remov</strong><strong>als</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf</a>]]. R&amp;I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.</p><p>Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&amp;I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will <strong>help coordinat</strong><strong>e</strong> the research community and key stakeholders in <strong>developing, testing and demonstrating</strong><strong>carbon farming practices and</strong><strong> in certifying carbon removals</strong>. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.</p><p>Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&amp;I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&amp;I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&amp;I on manure management will help <strong>implement the EU methane strategy</strong>[[<sup></sup><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf</a></u>]]. R&amp;I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest <strong>as </strong><strong>a natural and man-made carbon sink</strong> and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the <strong>Fit for 55</strong> package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new <strong>EU forest strategy</strong>.</p><p>Strengthening the <strong>nexus between the ocean and climate change</strong> is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables<strong></strong>and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&amp;I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.</p><p>The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:</p><ul><li>more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;</li><li>exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;</li><li>more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;</li><li>consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture.</li></ul><p>Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<strong>UNFCCC)</strong> on the ocean and climate change.</p><p>Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the <strong>EU Arctic policy</strong>; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on <strong>sustainable blue economy</strong> and its offshoot initiatives as well as<strong></strong>implementing the <strong>Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives</strong>; and iii) helping to achieve the <strong>clean planet for all</strong><strong>'s</strong> aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.</p><p>In line with the <strong>climate adaptation strategy</strong>[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en</a>]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.</p><p>In the area of forestry, R&amp;I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&amp;I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.</p><p>R&amp;I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&amp;I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.</p><p>Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[<sup></sup>This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].</p><p><u>Expected impacts</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to <strong>climate action on land </strong><strong>- including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water </strong>and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;</li><li>advancement of science and technology to support the <strong>adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems</strong>, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;</li><li>efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to <strong>climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential</strong> in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;</li><li>increased <strong>climate change mitigation in the primary sectors</strong>, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining <strong>natural and man-made carbon sinks</strong> and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;</li><li>improved <strong>capacity</strong><strong>to climate change</strong> of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;</li><li><strong>sustainable management of</strong><strong> scarce resources</strong>, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.</li></ul>",,,

R&amp;I will rely on the application of digital technologies where relevant.</p><p>The <strong>EU climate law</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&amp;from=EN"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R1119&amp;from=EN</a>]] states that to reach 2030 and 2050 climate targets and to restore biodiversity, the EU needs to immediately and decisively restore and increase its natural carbon sinks. In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend <strong>Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554</a>]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a <strong>communication on sustainable carbon cycles, </strong>including<strong> carbon farming </strong>and<strong> certification</strong><strong>of carbon remov</strong><strong>als</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf</a>]]. R&amp;I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.</p><p>Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&amp;I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will <strong>help coordinat</strong><strong>e</strong> the research community and key stakeholders in <strong>developing, testing and demonstrating</strong><strong>carbon farming practices and</strong><strong> in certifying carbon removals</strong>. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.</p><p>Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&amp;I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&amp;I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&amp;I on manure management will help <strong>implement the EU methane strategy</strong>[[<sup></sup><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf</a></u>]]. R&amp;I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest <strong>as </strong><strong>a natural and man-made carbon sink</strong> and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the <strong>Fit for 55</strong> package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new <strong>EU forest strategy</strong>.</p><p>Strengthening the <strong>nexus between the ocean and climate change</strong> is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables<strong></strong>and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&amp;I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.</p><p>The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:</p><ul><li>more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;</li><li>exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;</li><li>more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;</li><li>consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture.</li></ul><p>Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<strong>UNFCCC)</strong> on the ocean and climate change.</p><p>Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the <strong>EU Arctic policy</strong>; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on <strong>sustainable blue economy</strong> and its offshoot initiatives as well as<strong></strong>implementing the <strong>Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives</strong>; and iii) helping to achieve the <strong>clean planet for all</strong><strong>'s</strong> aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.</p><p>In line with the <strong>climate adaptation strategy</strong>[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en</a>]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.</p><p>In the area of forestry, R&amp;I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&amp;I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.</p><p>R&amp;I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&amp;I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.</p><p>Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[<sup></sup>This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].</p><p><u>Expected impacts</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to <strong>climate action on land </strong><strong>- including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water </strong>and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;</li><li>advancement of science and technology to support the <strong>adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems</strong>, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;</li><li>efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to <strong>climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential</strong> in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;</li><li>increased <strong>climate change mitigation in the primary sectors</strong>, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining <strong>natural and man-made carbon sinks</strong> and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;</li><li>improved <strong>capacity</strong><strong>to climate change</strong> of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;</li><li><strong>sustainable management of</strong><strong> scarce resources</strong>, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.</li></ul>",,,

However, the portfolios of climate change adaptation policies remain embryonic and fragmented today: instruments focus mostly on building adaptive capacity through the creation of locally relevant databases and monitoring systems, awareness raising and capacity building actions, education and training. For example, the increasing attention to 'just resilience' at strategic level is not matched with corresponding actions in the field and 'issues of equity and social justice are still rarely considered in local-level adaptation planning and actions?; 'many climate adaptation measures focus on technological interventions, without accounting for the social characteristics of cities, and thus fail to address the unequal burdens of climate impacts'.</p><p>Local adaptation to climate change measures should never be taken in isolation.

It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong> and to accelerate their transformation to become <strong>climate resilient. </strong>By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

Among the various marine citizen science activities, very prominent are the ones that engage actors from different parts of society to contribute to the observation of the coastal zone and the ocean and produce relevant data, related to physical, chemical, geological properties of the marine environment, marine biodiversity and/or human impact (e.g.: marine litter). It is important to capitalise on this interest, both by sustaining and increasing the sense of community and motivation of these actors and by providing them with validated methodological protocols and processes, to ensure that the information and data they collect becomes available and useful for wider use.</p><p>The objective of this topic is to establish a Marine Citizen Science data network, which will aim to bring together the very important, but scattered and un-coordinated actors of marine citizen science, active in data collection. Such a network will provide a sense of community to these different in nature parties, will increase visibility of marine citizen science data collection activities in Europe and will invest in coordinating these activities by providing a harmonisation framework, which will increase the added value coming from marine citizen science. Such an activity will ensure dual effects towards the Mission's Ocean cross-cutting enabling actions: it will support targeted engagement of different categories of social actors in the production of credible Marine Knowledge and it will thus directly support the development of the Digital Ocean and Water Knowledge System.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all following activities:</p><ul><li><strong>Establishment of a Marine Citizen Science network </strong></li></ul><p>The pan-European Marine Citizen Science data network is expected to bring together actors in marine citizen science data collection domains in the European Union and in neighbouring countries and to build a sense of community between these actors, engaging and coordinating different type of organisations. The core aim of the network will be to support its participants to contact the various marine citizen science data collection communities efficiently and in a manner that will increase the added value of their contribution towards Marine Knowledge. The network should aim to include actors from all different data fields on marine citizen science.</p><p>A key activity for the establishment of the network consists in the identification, mapping and involvement of the different actors that provide observation and data input to marine citizen science, extending from volunteer or scientific groups (schools, NGOs or universities, tourists) to more structured community contributions that can come from professionals (for instance fishermen) or companies (sailing companies, port authorities, etc.) that are willing to contribute in these initiatives.</p><p>The network should act as a multiplier of work contacted on marine citizen science data collection from different organisations around Europe and operate as a connection hub for their activities. Through the described actions the network will ensure the higher visibility of marine citizen science data collection activities in Europe and will contribute both to motivate the already engaged actors and to bring in the network more interested parties, by connecting them with the appropriate organisations, providing them with community advice on how to set up their own activities, in line with common standards and sharing the collective knowledge created through the network.</p><p>The long-term sustainability of the proposed network should be considered.</p><ul><li><strong>Citizen science activities: information and data collection</strong></li></ul><p>To increase the added value of the marine citizen science activities, the proposals should ensure that information and data collected are widely usable and integrated in existing knowledge management platforms (e.g.: EMODnet, Blue Economy Observatory, etc.) and in the end be available for use in the European Digital Twin of the Ocean (EU DTO).</p><p>Specific activities are expected to adapt and make available data and metadata standards appropriate for use in marine citizen science, building on the work developed by SeaDataNet, EMODnet and other marine data infrastructures. These standards should be tailored to the needs of citizen science and ensure that the data collected can be harmonised and used in an effective manner.</p><p>The proposals should also consider the development of easy-to-use tutorials and easy-to-understand training modules, targeted to different categories of marine citizens science actors collecting data. This material should focus on methodologies to ensure that the data collected is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable), will explain how data is made available and will provide recommendations and guidelines for effective citizen science observing activities. The training materials should also ensure that citizen science activities do not conflict with nature protection objectives.</p><p>Finally, the proposals are expected to address the development of good practices regarding data and information consumption coming from marine citizen science activities and make these good practices visible at local, national and European level, as well as at the international level, particularly through the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development.</p><ul><li><strong>Deployment of cost-efficient, citizen science appropriate observing equipment</strong></li></ul><p>The proposals should ensure the link between marine citizen science actors and the developers of cost-efficient ocean observing sensors and to facilitate the procurement of appropriate and easy to use citizen science devices and equipment that will enhance and harmonise the outputs of marine citizen science in Europe.</p><p>Proposals are expected to define and implement two use-cases to demonstrate in real conditions the use of affordable, durable, high-efficiency and low-carbon footprint marine observing devices/equipment, relevant and applicable to marine citizen science. Observing devices/sensors that are easy to use, automated, standardised and with direct uploading of date in verified databases should be prioritised.</p><p>These use-cases will act as pilots, to show, on one side the benefits of using standardised, simple to deploy and use equipment for wide citizen science campaigns and on the other, the benefits and the economies of scale of large procurements of observing devices/equipment for citizen science.</p><p>These use-cases should also provide insights for the mobilisation of public and private funding to maximise future deployment and use of observation devices/sensors, thus supporting the scaling up of marine citizen science activities in Europe.</p>","<p>The Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030' will provide a systemic approach for the restoration, protection and preservation of our ocean, seas and waters.

These operational settings should include a) an onboard gravimeter and b) terrestrial networks of gravimeters, consisting of at least eight gravimeters in total.</li><li>Identification of new use cases and provision of innovative quantum gravimeter services for these use cases.</li><li>The network of quantum gravimeters developed and optimised as part of the project should be ready for integration into a multi-country initiative such as a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Quantum gravimeters (gravity sensors) can deliver high-sensitivity, real-time, non-invasive gravity measurements, with much greater precision than classical gravimeters. They have started to demonstrate their disruptive potential in many application sectors, including Earth observation and civil engineering. The unmatched precision offered by quantum gravimeters will only become more important in a world where extreme weather events are becoming more and more common, and where there is an even greater need to observe and track resources that are located up to several kilometres under the ground, such as water basins, gas deposits or magma concentrations.</p><p>Under this action, a consortium of public laboratories, metrology institutes, scientific institutes and/or other relevant partners is expected to carry out innovation activities to develop and demonstrate the practical viability and usefulness of a network of quantum gravimeters in specific operational settings, both in the form of a terrestrial network and also mounted on flying carriers (these could include innovative carriers such as drones, balloons or other flying carriers) and/or on ships or other seaborne carriers. Mounted gravimeters are to be deployed flexibly in different locations as needed, in order to provide gravity maps of potential areas of interest and confirm where more detailed exploration is worth pursuing. Terrestrial networks are then to be deployed at those specific sites to enable high-resolution, reproductible measurements to be performed over time to monitor and investigate areas of interest (such as volcanoes or zones with underground reservoirs). In all cases, gravimeters should be operated in order to deliver results for innovative use cases in areas including, but not limited to, Earth observation, geodesy, oceanography, hydrology, volcano monitoring and civil engineering.</p><p>Proposals should seek to:</p><ul><li>Deliver an extended proof-of-concept for deploying quantum gravimeters in innovative operational settings, including a) as terrestrial networks of several (8 to 10 in total) quantum gravimeters (possibly in hybrid mode with classical gravimeters and/or other types of quantum sensors such as magnetometers) and b) as individual quantum gravimeters mounted on flying carriers (which could include innovative carriers such as drones, balloons or other flying carriers) and/or on ships or other seaborne carriers. The proposal should detail the actions planned to procure gravimeters capable of carrying out the tasks needed to achieve the project's deliverables, including the adaptation of these gravimeters for use on mounted carriers.</li><li>Develop the components, tools, techniques and processes for optimising and industrializing quantum gravimeters for these innovative configurations, by enhancing their performance according to parameters such as resolution, sensitivity, precision, reproducibility, integration time, autonomy, footprint, robustness, compactness, and real-time data processing. They should seek to optimise the network configuration and carriers for operating quantum gravimeters and assess exhaustively and reproducibly the performances of the systems that are designed.</li><li>Operate the optimised quantum gravimeters and their network infrastructure and carriers to deliver scientific results beyond the state-of-the-art (including in terms of precision) for use cases in areas including, but not limited to, Earth observation, geodesy, oceanography, hydrology, volcano monitoring and civil engineering. They should demonstrate the added value of operating mounted gravimeters and terrestrial networks of gravimeters, if possible in combination (e.g. by analysing areas of interest sequentially).</li><li>Provide a plan for the long-term operation of the infrastructure beyond the life of the project, involving other EU actors working in relevant areas, so that it is ready for integration into a multi-country initiative such as a European Digital Infrastructure Consortium. They should also provide an extensive review of use cases that can be addressed by quantum gravimeters for various configurations. Interoperability of the data for potential further reuse with European data ecosystem initiatives including, but not limited, to the Data Spaces (funded under the Digital Europe Programme), the European Open Science Cloud, and Destination Earth, should be duly taken into account, while respecting all applicable legislation and access and using rights distinguished between different user groups (government, cooperations, research institutes etc.) for the data generated. They should also demonstrate how other types of quantum sensors could be integrated into the infrastructure.</li></ul><p>The Commission considers that proposals with an overall duration of 36-48 months would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude the submission and selection of proposals requesting other durations.</p><p>Proposals should also cover synergies with other relevant European initiatives and programmes, including the Quantum Technologies Flagship and the planned development and deployment of a European space gravimetry infrastructure under Horizon Europe Cluster 4 Destination 5 (Open strategic autonomy in developing, deploying and using global space-based infrastructures, services, applications and data). In addition, they should contribute to spreading excellence across Europe; for example, through the involvement of Widening Countries.</p><p>The intended users of the infrastructure built by the project and the services it offers are entities established in the eligible countries.</p><p>In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.</p> <span>Specific Topic Conditions</span>:<p><p>Activities are expected to start at TRL 6 and achieve TRL 8 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.</p></p>",,"<p>This destination will directly support the following Key Strategic Orientations (KSOs), as outlined in the Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li>KSO A, '<strong>Promoting an open strategic autonomy by leading the development of key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, sectors and value chains</strong> to accelerate and steer the digital and green transitions through human-centred technologies and innovations.'</li><li>KSO C, '<strong>Making Europe the first digitally led circular, climate-neutral and sustainable economy</strong> through the transformation of its mobility, energy, construction and production systems</li></ul><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact:</p><ul><li><strong>Open strategic autonomy in digital technologies and in future emerging enabling technologies</strong>, by strengthening European capacities in key parts of digital and future supply chains, allowing agile responses to urgent needs, and by investing in early discovery and industrial uptake of new technologies.</li></ul><p>Electronic and photonic components, and the software that defines how they work, are the key digital technologies that underpin all digital systems. As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates, most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe's autonomy, particularly in periods of geopolitical instability, exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components, Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment, electric and autonomous vehicles, manufacturing and production plants and equipment, telecom networks, aerospace vehicles, consumer products</p><p>R&amp;I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide, with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times, to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality ('Internet of Senses?). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.</p><p>Despite a strong European scientific community's on AI and robotics, Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, transport, agriculture, energy, construction), providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.</p><p>While Europe is strong in many sectors, it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness, prosperity and sustainability, by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies, e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches, use of biological elements as part of technology, and sustainable smart materials. In particular, the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet, but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.</p><p>In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118), in particular its 'secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures' pillar, actions under this Destination will support Europe's open strategic autonomy, and reinforce and regain European industry's leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene, and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.</p><p>Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions, which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI, Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore, promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>As a result, this Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>European Innovation Leadership in Photonics</li></ul><p>The European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments, far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications, and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.</p><p>The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'Photonics'.</p><ul><li>AI, Data and Robotics</li></ul><p>Europe has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research, Europe's scientific community is leading in AI and robotics, but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion, less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology, with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies, only capture 10% of full potential use, and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai"">https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai</a> (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, many AI, Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore, there is room for improved adoption by industry, which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&amp;I, from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general, industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies, but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, public sector, utilities, retail, finance, insurance, transport, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, construction, media, creative and cultural industries, fashion, tourism, etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.</p><p>Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>When it comes to Robotics, Europe is leading in its industry, with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics' cognition, safety, manipulation, soft robotics, underwater and aerial robotics, with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare, agri-food[[The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming, fisheries, horticulture etc., as well as produce processing, ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.]], forestry, inspection and maintenance, logistics, construction, manufacturing, etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial, marine, ground, in-vivo and space).</p><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies.</p><p>Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><ul><li>Open Source for Cloud/Edge and Software Engineering Fundamentals to support Digital Autonomy</li></ul><p>The European strategy for data (COM(2020) 66) aims at creating a single market that will ensure Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This calls for the ability to handle the entire data life-cycle which in turn relies on the underlying computing infrastructure (from the hardware to the software).</p><p>In the light of dominant players, bridging established computing models (High Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, edge-computing and other emerging computing architectures) becomes a critical success factor for enabling a computing continuum. Open computing architectures at many levels based on Open approaches spanning both software/hardware is thus a pre-requisite for Digital autonomy - notably when it comes to Cloud infrastructures where European players are falling short.</p><p>Actions under this heading will thus support the next steps of development and adoption of Open technologies on different levels while fostering progress on responsible software engineering fundamentals.</p><ul><li>European leadership in Emerging and Enabling Technologies</li></ul><p>Europe's leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement, but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged, with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech, though, this intertwining is essential.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe's future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.</p><ul><li>Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm Shift</li></ul><p>Since 2018, the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe's scientific leadership and excellence in quantum, in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU's aims for quantum R&amp;I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship's Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402"">https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402</a>]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators, which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship, by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing, simulation, sensing and communication, in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership, capitalising on Europe's established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.</p><p>The aim of the Commission's Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world, and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty, as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used, among others, for sensitive applications in the area of security, and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context, the EU must take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets, interests, autonomy and security, while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.</p><p>The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators, that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025, with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact, with applications in medicine, manufacturing, or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography, finance and many other sensitive domains.</p><p>Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU's interests, as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications, sensors for autonomous vehicles, and the next generation of medical sensors.</p><p>It is therefore clearly in the EU's interests to protect European research in these domains, the intellectual property that it generates, and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result, while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe's strategic dependencies). With this in mind, the Commission has decided that, in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation, communication, and sensing, only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.</p><p>The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.</p><ul><li>Graphene: Europe in the lead</li></ul><p>The starting point is the Graphene Flagship, launched in 2013, which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&amp;I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation, automotive, electronics, batteries, healthcare).</p><p>The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes.</p><p><strong>Expected impact</strong></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to <strong>digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal</strong>, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Europe's open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI, data, robotics, quantum computing, and graphene, and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.</li><li>Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.</li><li>Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms.</li></ul><p><strong>Innovation Actions</strong> ?

Advances across these areas can help create human-centric AI, which reflects the needs and values of European citizens and contribute to an effective governance of AI technologies.</p><p>The need for transparent and robust AI systems has become more pressing with the rapid growth and commercialisation of generative AI systems based on foundation models. Despite their impressive capabilities, trustworthiness remains an unresolved, fundamental scientific challenge. Due to the intricate nature of generative AI systems, understanding or explaining the rationale behind their outputs is normally not possible with current explainable AI methods. Moreover, these models occasionally tend to 'hallucinate', generating non-factual or inaccurate information, further compromising their reliability.</p><p>To achieve robust and reliable AI, novel approaches are needed to develop methods and solutions that work under other than model-ideal circumstances, while also having an awareness when these conditions break down. To achieve trustworthiness, AI system should be sufficiently transparent and capable of explaining how the system has reached a conclusion in a way that it is meaningful to the user, enabling safe and secure human-machine interaction, while also indicating when the limits of operation have been reached.</p><p>The purpose is to advance AI-algorithms and innovations based on them that can perform safely under a common variety of circumstances, reliably in real-world conditions and predict when these operational circumstances are no longer valid. The research should aim at advancing robustness and explainability for a generality of solutions, while leading to an acceptable loss in accuracy and efficiency, and with known verifiability and reproducibility.

The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027).</li><li><p>Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes.</p></li></ul><p>The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.</p><p>In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&amp;I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.</p><p>The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.</p><p>It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.</p><p>Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>Leadership in AI based on trust</li></ul><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.</p><p>Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.</p><p><strong>EIT Digital</strong> plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ?</p><ul><li>An Internet of Trust</li></ul><p>The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.</p><ul><li>eXtended Reality (XR)</li></ul><p>Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and condition</p><p>The objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.</p><ul><li>Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry.</li></ul><p>This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.</p><ul><li>Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies</li></ul><p>The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade?), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.</p><p>In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.</p><p>Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.</p><ul><li>European standards for industrial competitiveness</li></ul><p>The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.</p><p>Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.</p><p>Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&amp;I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.</p><p>Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.</p><ul><li>International cooperation</li></ul><p>The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.</p><p>Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&amp;I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.</p><p>Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&amp;I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020</a>]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment). It will also contribute to the overarching objectives of our continental partnership in full alignment with the principles of the Global Gateway.</p><p>Cooperation with Latin America will aim at exploiting the potential of the newly established BELLA network and implement the outcomes of EU-LAC dialogues in the context of digitalisation and R&amp;I.</p><p>Additionally, international collaboration is encouraged or targeted in several thematic areas may also be addressed within the respective Joint Undertakings (Smart Networks and Services, EuroHPC, and Key Digital Technologies).</p><p><strong>Innovation Actions</strong> ?

As the digitalisation of all sectors accelerates, most industries depend on early access to digital components. Dependence on these technologies represents a clear threat to Europe's autonomy, particularly in periods of geopolitical instability, exposing Europe to risks of vulnerability. Actions under this Destination will build on EU strengths in low-power consumption and ultra-secure components, Europe needs to develop the essential electronic and photonic components for a wide range of applications such as healthcare equipment, electric and autonomous vehicles, manufacturing and production plants and equipment, telecom networks, aerospace vehicles, consumer products</p><p>R&amp;I initiatives on 6G technologies are now starting in leading regions world-wide, with the first products and infrastructures expected for the end of this decade. 6G systems are expected to offer a new step change in performance from Gigabit towards Terabit capacities and sub-millisecond response times, to enable new critical applications such as real-time automation or eXtended Reality ('Internet of Senses?). Europe must engage now to be among the top influencers of - and competitors in - these technologies and ensure that emerging network technology standards are defined following European values and energy-efficiency requirements. Main actions on 6G technologies will be undertaken in the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking.</p><p>Despite a strong European scientific community's on AI and robotics, Europe lags behind in AI diffusion. Actions under this Destination will develop world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries (e.g. manufacturing, healthcare, transport, agriculture, energy, construction), providing top-performing solutions that businesses will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental sustainability.</p><p>While Europe is strong in many sectors, it must take ownership of its unavoidable future transformations for competitiveness, prosperity and sustainability, by early leadership in new and emerging enabling technologies, e.g. alternative computing models such as bio- and neuro-morphic approaches, use of biological elements as part of technology, and sustainable smart materials. In particular, the far-reaching impact of quantum and graphene technologies on our economy and society cannot be fully estimated yet, but they will be disruptive for many fields. Actions in this Destination will ensure that Europe stays ahead in this global race and is in a position to achieve game-changing breakthroughs.</p><p>In line with the vision set out in the Digital Decade Communication (COM(2021)118), in particular its 'secure and performant sustainable digital infrastructures' pillar, actions under this Destination will support Europe's open strategic autonomy, and reinforce and regain European industry's leaderships across the digital supply chain. It will direct investments to activities that will ensure a robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms. Autonomy will require sustaining first-mover advantage in strategic areas like quantum computing and graphene, and investing early in emerging enabling technologies.</p><p>Investments in this Destination contribute substantially to climate change objectives. Energy efficiency is a key design principle in actions, which will lead to new technologies and solutions that are cornerstones for a sustainable economy and society. These solutions range from ultra-low-power processors to AI, Data and Robotics solutions for resource optimisation and reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions; from highly efficient optical networking technologies and ultra-low-energy 6G communication networks to robotics that overcome the limitation of energy autonomy. Furthermore, promising emerging avenues are addressed via ultra-low power operations enabled by spintronics and 2D materials-based devices and systems for energy storage and harvesting.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research and innovation process. To ensure trustworthiness and wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote high standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>As a result, this Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>European Innovation Leadership in Photonics</li></ul><p>The European photonics industry has an excellent position in core segments, far above the average EU market share. The objective of the topics grouped in this heading is to strengthen current leadership in photonic technologies and applications, and to secure access in Europe to cutting-edge photonic technologies.</p><p>The topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'Photonics'.</p><ul><li>AI, Data and Robotics</li></ul><p>Europe has an outstanding track record in key areas of AI research, Europe's scientific community is leading in AI and robotics, but substantial efforts are needed to transform this into (disruptive) European AI technology products that can withstand international competitors. Europe also lags behind in technology diffusion, less than half of European firms have adopted AI technology, with a majority of those still in the pilot stage. 70% of these adopter companies, only capture 10% of full potential use, and only 2% percent of European firms in healthcare are using those technologies at 80% of potential[[See <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai"">https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/tackling-europes-gap-in-digital-and-ai</a> (based on data from 2017 and 2018)]]. Moreover, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, many AI, Data and Robotics solutions exist today but only a limited number of them reaches the level of maturity and adoption necessary to solve the problems at hand. Therefore, there is room for improved adoption by industry, which requires a drastic increase of industry-driven R&amp;I, from basic research to large-scale piloting. In general, industry acknowledges the potential of AI technologies, but often lacks demonstrable benefits for their particular use cases.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, data and robotics in developing world-class technologies serving the needs of all types of European industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, public sector, utilities, retail, finance, insurance, transport, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, environmental monitoring, construction, media, creative and cultural industries, fashion, tourism, etc. providing top-performing solutions that industries will trust and adopt to maintain their competitiveness and maximise their contribution to environmental and resources sustainability.</p><p>Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>When it comes to Robotics, Europe is leading in its industry, with a high intensity of use of robots. Europe is also scientifically leading in robotics' cognition, safety, manipulation, soft robotics, underwater and aerial robotics, with demonstrated impacts in many use-cases in key industrial sectors (e.g.: healthcare, agri-food[[The term Agri-Food is intended to cover a wide range of food production sectors including livestock farming, fisheries, horticulture etc., as well as produce processing, ingredient preparation and food manufacture and assembly.]], forestry, inspection and maintenance, logistics, construction, manufacturing, etc.) and across multiple modalities (aerial, marine, ground, in-vivo and space).</p><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in robotics, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies.</p><p>Several topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><ul><li>Open Source for Cloud/Edge and Software Engineering Fundamentals to support Digital Autonomy</li></ul><p>The European strategy for data (COM(2020) 66) aims at creating a single market that will ensure Europe's global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This calls for the ability to handle the entire data life-cycle which in turn relies on the underlying computing infrastructure (from the hardware to the software).</p><p>In the light of dominant players, bridging established computing models (High Performance Computing, Cloud Computing, edge-computing and other emerging computing architectures) becomes a critical success factor for enabling a computing continuum. Open computing architectures at many levels based on Open approaches spanning both software/hardware is thus a pre-requisite for Digital autonomy - notably when it comes to Cloud infrastructures where European players are falling short.</p><p>Actions under this heading will thus support the next steps of development and adoption of Open technologies on different levels while fostering progress on responsible software engineering fundamentals.</p><ul><li>European leadership in Emerging and Enabling Technologies</li></ul><p>Europe's leading industry sectors have a solid track-record in constant improvement, but less so for embracing transformative ideas. The pathway from research to industry uptake is often long and staged, with no intertwining of research and industry agendas. In the age of deep-tech, though, this intertwining is essential.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to identify early technologies that have the potential to become Europe's future leading technologies in all areas of this cluster and to establish industry leadership in these technologies from the outset. This heading has a unique focus on off-roadmap transformations with a longer time-horizon but profound potential impact.</p><ul><li>Flagship on Quantum Technologies: a Paradigm Shift</li></ul><p>Since 2018, the Quantum Technologies Flagship has been consolidating and expanding Europe's scientific leadership and excellence in quantum, in order to foster the development of a competitive quantum industrial and research ecosystem in Europe. The EU's aims for quantum R&amp;I in the next decade are set out in detail in the Quantum Flagship's Strategic Research Agenda (SRA[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402"">https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=65402</a>]]) and its associated main Key Performance Indicators, which drafted and published in 2020 on quantum computing, quantum simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing and metrology. Projects in each of these areas are currently supported by the Flagship, by other EU research initiatives and by national programmes.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to further develop quantum technologies and their applications in the areas of quantum computing, simulation, sensing and communication, in order to strengthen European technological sovereignty in this strategic field and achieve first-mover industry leadership, capitalising on Europe's established excellence in quantum science and technology maintaining and developing quantum competences and skills available in the EU and raising the capabilities of all Member States in this field.</p><p>The aim of the Commission's Digital Decade strategy is for the EU to become digitally sovereign in an interconnected world, and in the coming years quantum technologies will be a key element of this digital sovereignty, as they are of global strategic importance. Quantum technologies will be also used, among others, for sensitive applications in the area of security, and in dual-use applications. Other world regions are already investing heavily in all areas of quantum technologies research. In this context, the EU must take action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. This will enable it to safeguard its strategic assets, interests, autonomy and security, while advancing towards its goal of open strategic autonomy.</p><p>The Quantum Technologies Flagship conducts research and development activities in the key domains of quantum computing and simulation, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. The Flagship will contribute to world-leading quantum computers and simulators, that will be acquired by the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking, and will be crucial to achieving its Digital Decade goal of having its first computer with quantum acceleration by 2025, with a view to being at the cutting edge of quantum capabilities by 2030. These machines will have a profound impact, with applications in medicine, manufacturing, or new material and new drugs design but also in cryptography, finance and many other sensitive domains.</p><p>Research in quantum sensing technologies is also vital to the EU's interests, as it will develop European expertise in quantum clocks for navigation (including for embarkation on Galileo satellites) and precise timing applications, sensors for autonomous vehicles, and the next generation of medical sensors.</p><p>It is therefore clearly in the EU's interests to protect European research in these domains, the intellectual property that it generates, and the strategic assets that will be developed as a result, while taking steps to avoid situations of technological dependency on non-EU sources (in line with the call of the October 2020 European Council to reduce Europe's strategic dependencies). With this in mind, the Commission has decided that, in the research areas covered by 6 actions in this work programme in quantum computing and simulation, communication, and sensing, only Associated Countries that meet certain conditions will be eligible to participate in these actions.</p><p>The eligibility to participate in such actions is limited to specific entities as specified in the relevant topics.</p><ul><li>Graphene: Europe in the lead</li></ul><p>The starting point is the Graphene Flagship, launched in 2013, which already reached European leadership in graphene and related 2D materials. The work is now coming to a critical point where first simple products are being launched. R&amp;I activities would now need to be pursued and accelerated in order to translate achieved technology advances that are at TRL 3-5 into concrete innovation opportunities and into production capabilities in many industrial sectors (e.g. aviation, automotive, electronics, batteries, healthcare).</p><p>The objective of this heading is to strengthen and accelerate the technology developments that support a strong European supply and value chain in graphene and related materials and provide first-mover market advantages of scale.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; large-scale roll-out of innovative new technologies and solutions (e.g. new energy-efficient connectivity technologies) via the Connecting Europe Facility; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; and use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes.</p><p><strong>Expected impact</strong></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to <strong>digital and emerging technologies for competitiveness and fit for the Green Deal</strong>, and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Europe's open strategic autonomy by sustaining first-mover advantages in strategic areas including AI, data, robotics, quantum computing, and graphene, and by investing early in emerging enabling technologies.</li><li>Reinforced European industry leadership across the digital supply chain.</li><li>Robust European industrial and technology presence in all key parts of a greener digital supply chain, from low-power components to advanced systems, future networks, new data technologies and platforms.</li></ul><p><strong>Innovation Actions</strong> ?

The rapid adoption of new technologies offers an immense potential for improved standards of living, safer mobility, better healthcare, new jobs, or the personalisation of public services. At the same time, it presents risks such as skills mismatches, digital divides, customer lock-in, or serious breaches of security or privacy.</p><p>The green and digital transitions rely on improved and adapted skills, and knowledge and competences become all the more important. All communities have the right to benefit from these new digital and green developments, leading to a more inclusive society, increased trust and a better adoption of new products and services. Developments in digital and enabling technologies have the potential to enhance social inclusion, can inform up-skilling training programmes and ensure a two-way engagement with society with regard to developing technologies.</p><p>In addition to the support for skills development integrated in topics, two contribution agreements from Cluster 4 to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are envisaged:</p><ul><li>Support for the establishment of a European Raw Materials Skills Academy as described in the Net Zero Industry Act proposal. The European Raw Materials Academy would aim to re-skill and up-skill a workforce required for the raw materials value chain in the EU. The implementation would be open to competition from KICs, who can also partner up. The action will have a duration of three years (2024-2027).</li><li><p>Support for the establishment of a European Advanced Materials Academy, open to a competitive call for EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), to identify the needs in advanced materials skills, the issues that the current workforce is facing, and to attract people to materials science and expand the existing workforce. This new academy will collaborate closely with other activities on advanced materials (including nanomaterials and 2D materials) and any other strategic action put forward under the next Work Programmes.</p></li></ul><p>The priorities in this domain are aligned with the objectives of the Digital Decade to build secure and sustainable digital infrastructures and to support the digital transformation of businesses and public services. It will directly support individual innovators (researchers, developers, high-tech SMEs and start-ups, etc.) engaged in developing the technologies for a trustworthy and human-centric digital environment, building on a more resilient, and decentralised internet architecture and enabling new social and business models respecting European values.</p><p>In particular, the Digital Decade and its compass set a target 80% of citizens using a digital ID solution by 2030. In order to achieve this target, Europe needs to build an Internet of Trust empowering end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity. The Internet of Trust will also mobilise innovators towards more sustainable and secure internet infrastructures, supporting the Digital Decade objective of setting up 10000 climate neutral highly secured edge nodes. Finally the R&amp;I priorities in this domain will fully support the international dimension of the digital decade by promoting the EU human-centred approach with key international partners.</p><p>The issue of trust has become central in the use of technologies, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. As outlined in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2020)65), for AI technologies, trust requires in particular improving transparency (explainability, expected levels of performance). For the Internet, increasing trust requires new tools and services to ensure that GDPR is a reality for end-users.</p><p>It is also an opportunity for Europe to re-gain presence on the consumer electronics market, by developing new interactive applications in various sectors with solutions meeting European values and requirements in terms of privacy and security. The COVID-19 crisis has also shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society.</p><p>Actions under this Destination will support EU objectives of inclusiveness, by supporting a human-centred approach to technology development that is aligned with European social and ethical values, as well as sustainability. These actions will further contribute to addressing the challenges faced by European industry and support the creation of sustainable, high-quality jobs by targeting skills mismatches, the need to empower all workers, and ethical considerations relating to technological progress.</p><p>Actions should devote particular attention to openness of the solutions and results, and transparency of the research process. To ensure trustworthiness, public awareness and support, wide adoption by user communities for the benefit of society, actions should promote the highest standards of transparency and openness. Actions should ensure that the processes and outcomes of research and innovation align with the needs, values and expectations of society, in line with Responsible Research and Innovation.</p><p>This Destination is structured into the following headings, which group topics together with similar outcomes to address a common challenge:</p><ul><li>Leadership in AI based on trust</li></ul><p>The objective of this heading is to ensure autonomy for Europe in AI, leading the way in research, development and deployment of world-class technologies that are beneficial to humans individually, organisationally and societally, and that adheres to European values, such as the principles reflected in our fundamental rights and environmental sustainability. Technologies need to be developed that industries and citizens will trust, so and that they could be applied in a wide range of applications and industrial sectors. Trustworthy AI is particularly key in applications such as (but not limited to) healthcare or in diverse critical infrastructures such as energy and transportation.</p><p>Some topics of this heading are under the co-programmed Partnership 'AI, Data and Robotics'.</p><p>Proposals are encouraged to link with relevant European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), in particular the EIT Digital.</p><p><strong>EIT Digital</strong> plays role in shaping technologies and innovations that work for people. At least two of its focus areas, Digital Wellbeing and Digital Cities, address directly topics such as ethical artificial intelligence, predictive analytics or augmented and virtual reality that are relevant to this areas. The solutions will benefit from the increasing will of citizens to participate in the sharing economy. EIT Digital, through projects with cities for example, improves engagement and inclusiveness of the citizens and of the visitors by increasingly organising and exposing data, especially in real time and along with analytics and machine learning. Augmented and virtual reality of the cities are another facet of exposing or simulating city data from the past, present or future to the benefit of citizens. ?</p><ul><li>An Internet of Trust</li></ul><p>The issue of trust in the internet has become central, following revelations about the exploitation of personal data, large-scale cybersecurity and data breaches, and growing awareness of online disinformation. A 2019 survey shows that half of the global internet users are more concerned about their online privacy compared to a year previously. Distrust in the Internet is causing people to change the way they behave online, for example by disclosing less personal information. Users also express an increasing level of distrust of social media platforms.</p><p>The objective of this heading is to develop a trustworthy digital environment, built on a more resilient, sustainable, and decentralised internet, to empower end-users with more control over their data and their digital identity, and to enable new social and business models respecting European values.</p><ul><li>eXtended Reality (XR)</li></ul><p>Due to its low presence in the consumer electronics industry, Europe is increasingly dependent on external providers in this area. This raises concerns about its digital sovereignty in crucial domains such as digital interaction services that are being adopted by a growing number of European users and industries. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how important distance and innovative learning is for society, our children, their parents and their teachers, maintaining social and educational links under challenging circumstances. Emerging technologies such as virtual reality, eXtended Reality or immersive environments provide numerous opportunities for personalised, innovative, efficient and inclusive learning, for learners of all ages, gender and condition</p><p>The objective of this heading is to gain industrial leadership in eXtended Reality technologies and immersive environments, while ensuring the European values of privacy, ethics and inclusiveness. It also aims to support the digital transformation of education through these technologies in particular.</p><ul><li>Systemic approaches to make the most of the technologies within society and industry.</li></ul><p>This heading promotes various systemic approaches to encourage creativity and make the most of the technologies developed elsewhere within society and industry. They include testing ideas in local communities; support for IP, standardisation and industry-academia exchanges; art-driven design; and assessments of complex socio-economic systems. These are complemented by support for a network of National Contact Points (NCPs), with a special emphasis on engaging with new actors.</p><p>Activities beyond R&amp;I investments will be needed to realise the expected impacts: testing, experimentation, demonstration, and support for take-up using the capacities, infrastructures, and European Digital Innovation Hubs made available under the Digital Europe Programme; further development of skills and competencies via the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, in particular EIT Digital and EIT Manufacturing; upscaling of trainings via the European Social Fund +; use of financial instruments under the InvestEU Fund for further commercialisation of R&amp;I outcomes; and links to the thematic smart specialisation platform on industrial modernisation.</p><ul><li>Digital Humanism and human compatible technologies</li></ul><p>The Digital Decade policy programme ('The Path to the Digital Decade?), sets a European approach for its digital transformation based on values and technological leadership.</p><p>In parallel, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to ensure a constructive role of culture in technology development in the spirit of methods to integrate non-technology innovation and social innovation.</p><p>Efforts will be pursued to help ensuring people are at the centre of the digital transformation, in line with our values and principles.</p><ul><li>European standards for industrial competitiveness</li></ul><p>The Communication 'Updating the 2020 Industrial strategy: towards a stronger Single Market for Europe's recovery' made clear that global leadership in technologies goes hand-in-hand with leadership in standard-setting and ensuring interoperability across the EU industrial ecosystems. EU industry needs European and international standards that underpin its twin digital and green transition. A minimal set of standards will also enable the creation of a soft layer for data sharing and exchange amongst EU industrial ecosystems and underpinning data spaces. Establishing global leadership in key priority standards such as cyber-security is also a critical matter for the competitiveness and resilience of EU industries. Global convergence on the same international standards helps reduce adaptation costs and strengthens EU and global value chains. Thus the topic of standards is an essential cross-cutting issue when it comes to the twin transition of the industrial ecosystems and making European industry more resilient.</p><p>Several digital decade targets for 2030 are addressed like tech up-take facilitated by interoperability standards, climate neutral highly secure edge notes and ethical principles for human-centred algorithms through international endorsed standards.</p><p>Standardisation can be an important factor for valorising EU R&amp;I projects, allowing new technologies to enter into a more mature phase, favouring their applicability on a larger scale and hence promoting their uptake.</p><p>Bringing the research and innovation community early on into the standards-making process is key to identify the issues and priorities, share views on future developments and stakeholder needs, and to provide recommendations to the European Commission and European standardisation organisations for future standardisation needs. Putting standards into science is very important to anticipate and prepare the standards-development process in future areas.</p><ul><li>International cooperation</li></ul><p>The proposed international coordination and support actions are aligned with the Commission's international priorities. They will help build strong international digital partnerships, and promote a human-centred digital agenda. International cooperation will further a level playing field and reciprocity while delivering new solutions to digital challenges. The proposed actions will be involved in trade and industrial policy aspects by promoting European technologies in key international markets. They will also support digital dialogues with partner countries.</p><p>Cooperation will be prioritised with Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore as part of our digital partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region. The resulting project will foster links with relevant research institutions on R&amp;I activities in the field of digital. It will also support the newly announced Trade and Technology Council with India.</p><p>Cooperation with countries in sub-Saharan Africa will stimulate R&amp;I cooperation with the EU and promote EU values for a human-centric digital transformation. Cooperation between Africa and EU will expand on the existing outcomes of Africa-EU cooperation especially in the field of Innovation Hubs cooperation[[See in particular ICT 58 Call : <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/ict-58-2020</a>]], sustainability of African digital ecosystems, reinforcement of the African private sector and contribution to Africa's economic growth (including SDG attainment). It will also contribute to the overarching objectives of our continental partnership in full alignment with the principles of the Global Gateway.</p><p>Cooperation with Latin America will aim at exploiting the potential of the newly established BELLA network and implement the outcomes of EU-LAC dialogues in the context of digitalisation and R&amp;I.</p><p>Additionally, international collaboration is encouraged or targeted in several thematic areas may also be addressed within the respective Joint Undertakings (Smart Networks and Services, EuroHPC, and Key Digital Technologies).</p><p><strong>Innovation Actions</strong> ?

EU4H-2024-PJ-01-4,Call for proposals to support the development of novel antivirals (HERA) - CP-g-24-105,EU4H-PJG EU4H Project Grants,EU4H Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-05-23T00:00:00,2024-09-05T17:00:00,,10000000,10000000,,46932879,46932873EU4HProjectGrants1716422400000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>This action supports the policy priority to be better prepared to respond to serious cross-border health threats. It contributes to the achievement of the EU4Health Programme's general objective of protecting people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health and strengthening the responsiveness of health systems and coordination among the Member States to cope with serious cross-border threats to health (Article 3, point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c), of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>This action aims to diversify and advance the pipeline of BSA candidates. More specifically, it will support the development and further characterisation of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting identified HERA priority viral families, which largely can be divided among respiratory RNA viral families, such as Paramyxo-, Orthomyxo and Coronaviridae, as well as those targeting viral families known for causing viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), such as Arena-, Bunya-, Flavi-, Filoviridae. The action aims to identify a potent BSA candidate, in order to advance its clinical development. A robust pipeline should contain multiple BSA candidates for each viral family that are developed in parallel. When selecting the BSA candidate, attention will be paid to the complementarity with existing Horizon Europe projects.</p><p>The proposal would need to cover early safety and efficacy trials for testing new or improved anti-viral therapeutics, with a clear regulatory and clinical pathway, including first in humans.</p><p>Innovative delivery systems and suitable safety profiles for broad use should be considered when possible as well as the application of novel approaches and widely applicable workflows (e.g. artificial intelligence) for rapid and reliable identification of broad-spectrum anti-viral therapeutics.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>HERA's threat assessment of 2022 included a vulnerability analysis with regard to the availability or absence of medical countermeasures, in particular the availability of vaccines and treatment options. Given that the large majority of identified virus families lack effective vaccines and/or effective therapeutics at the EU and global levels, HERA's long-term aim is to, inter alia, support the creation of a diverse portfolio of BSAs and BCCs that can be further developed in clinical by identifying most promising candidates and supporting their characterisation and assessment, including through clinical trials. Actions funded under this topic are therefore expected to either bring innovative, emerging, and cutting-edge elements with significant economic potential to the internal market or to reduce or prevent strategic dependencies of the Union, including by contributing to the Union's technological leadership in the innovation and development of BSA and enhancing the access to these products in the EU.</p>",,,,,

In this context, it implements the EU4Health general objective of improving the availability, accessibility and affordability of medicinal products and medical devices, and crisis-relevant products in the Union, and supports the innovation of such products (Article 3, point (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522) through the specific objectives defined in Article 4, points (b) and (c) of Regulation (EU) 2021/522.</p><p>The objective of this action is to foster innovation and support the development of next-generation respiratory PPE that overcomes the limitations outlined above and result in increased availability of enhanced medical countermeasures for pandemic preparedness and response.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Applicants might develop completely new technologies or rely on reformulated designs and novel applications of existing materials and technologies. Applicants need to propose a detailed plan to design, prototype, validate, and CE-mark innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable next-generation respirators. To overcome the limitations outlined above, they need to offer higher levels of protection than FFP2 respirators while being universally fitting, enabling comfortable multi-hour use.</p><p>Different solutions may target different populations (e.g., clinicians, critical workers, the public, etc.). Proposals should include a dissemination and market readiness plan that ensures a market for the product in preparedness times - e.g., through stockpiling or active use. This plan should generate sufficient demand to set up production.</p><p>Importantly, developers also need to demonstrate feasibility for a rapid production scale-up once a public health emergency materialises, possibly relying on distributed manufacturing solutions and use of accessible raw materials. Products should demonstrate the potential to be at a cost that will allow for a switch from the currently used PPE. To encourage sustainability, products should be reusable, less harmful to the environment and ideally foster environmentally friendly production. Proposals need to take into consideration that next generation respiratory devices should be easy to store (e.g., occupying minimum space in stockpiles and having long expiry dates) and simple to use by the target population.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>This action will support bringing next-generation PPE to the market to provide sustainable, universal and effective choices for the personal protection of healthcare and other essential workers, patients and the public. Superior respiratory protection will be available for stockpiling, scale-up and uptake by healthcare systems and the public in response to future pandemics or epidemics. The reduction of the use of single-use products will make the EU less vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.</p><p>Cost-effective and user-friendly next-generation respirators will slowly replace regular respirators and be deployed at national, regional, and local levels, ensuring better preparedness for future pandemics and other cross-border health threats. Widely incorporating improved respirators into clinical practice will also lead to better protection for healthcare workers and patients already in preparedness times, and overall improved health outcomes.</p>",,,,,

The revisions make the policy framework for sustainable energy more stringent and ambitious. While the legislative framework offers a good amount of flexibility to Member States to design the policy measures according to their needs and framework conditions, accurate monitoring, projecting and evaluation are essential elements of implementation. Importantly, the legislation is strongly interrelated and needs to be implemented and reported in an integrated, consistent way, including through the updates and implementation of the National Energy and Climate Plans, and their biannual integrated progress reports. </p><p>With these challenges in mind, the topic aims to support the implementation of the main pieces of legislation in the field of sustainable energy, notably of the Energy Efficiency Directive (Scope A), the Renewable Energy Directive (Scope B) and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Scope C). </p><p>Under the call 2024, proposals are invited for the Scopes A, B and C, i.e. proposals for actions to support Member States in the implementation of: </p><ul><li>the Energy Efficiency Directive (Scope A). </li><li>the Renewable Energy Directive (Scope B). </li><li>the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Scope C). </li></ul><p>Proposals are expected to focus on <strong><u>one</u></strong> of the 3 scopes established below.

As part of the REPowerEU Plan to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuels imports the European Commission has called for 10 million additional heat pumps installed within 5 years. While market growth of 2021 and 2022 alone - cumulatively amounting to slightly below 5 million new units - is already overshooting on this aspiration, it is becoming increasingly clear that the present market deployment alone will be insufficient to deliver a profound transformation of the heating sector in view of delivering in line with the Fit-for-55 target and beyond. Furthermore, through the Net-Zero Industry Act which is part of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the European Commission is aiming at increasing the manufacturing capacity of strategic net-zero technologies to meet at least 40% of the EU's annual deployment needs by 2030.</p><p>In this framework, the aim of this topic is to strengthen the enabling framework for the accelerated roll-out of high-quality heat pumps, complementing existing legislative and financial incentives at the EU, national and local levels. In particular, the topic aims to accelerate the deployment of heat pumps in existing buildings through alternative business and delivery models as well as in industrial sectors through a closer collaboration between different industrial sectors and industrial heat pump technology providers.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals should address only <strong><u>one</u></strong>of the two scopes below. The scope addressed should be clearly specified in the proposal's introduction.</p><p><strong>Scope A: Alternative business and delivery models </strong></p><p>Proposals should stimulate large-scale demand for heat pumps in existing buildings, while significantly reducing or spreading over several years the initial costs for product acquisition and installation.</p><p>To that end, the proposed actions should develop, demonstrate, upscale and/or replicate alternative business and/or heat delivery models.</p><p>For the purpose of this topic, business and delivery models refer to the arrangements between the involved parties and their roles involving a defined set of relationships, responsibilities and rights, including arrangements about equipment ownership and payment.</p><p>Proposals should ensure that installations are of high quality, that the selected buildings are suitable and ready (e.g. in terms of thermal insulation, internal distribution systems) for a heat pump prior to any installation, and that building heating needs and heat pump size are properly evaluated. To that end, proposals may apply innovative methods/tools simplifying processes and assessments.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness and replicability of the proposed approaches.</p><p>The focus of the proposed actions should be at least on space heating; however, this does not preclude considering additional functions such as water heating and space cooling. Actions may address any type of buildings, although multi?apartment and commercial buildings are especially encouraged. Synergies of heat pumps with PV installations and/or hybrid renewable heating and cooling systems could also be promoted.</p><p>Heat pumps should be designed and installed by professionals with relevant qualifications and skills. All relevant stakeholders necessary for the successful implementation of the action should be involved; if not directly involved, their support should be demonstrated in the proposal.</p><p>In this context, proposals may put in place new or strengthen existing strategic partnerships between relevant stakeholders (e.g. industry, installers, local authorities, consumer associations, integrated home renovation services) and consider the objective of the European Commission's Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age of strengthening, among others, the heat pump supply chain within the EU.</p><p>The proposed actions are invited to build on experiences and lessons learned from other relevant projects and programmes.</p><p><strong>Scope B: Collaboration between industrial sectors and industrial heat pump technology providers </strong></p><p>Proposals under this scope should promote a sustainable and efficient use of energy in at least one industrial sector by bridging the gap between users and providers of industrial heat pump solutions. Most notably, proposals should facilitate the collaboration between industrial sectors/sub-sectors sharing similar processes and energy related needs with heat pump manufacturers and providers. On the user side, specific industrial sectors could survey their sector's processes to define an 'average' process and reassess its operational energy needs in a most cost-effective way through a closer exchange with technology suppliers in order to effectively design sustainable energy solutions. On the provider side, manufacturers and providers of industrial heat pumps could optimise and standardise their existing technological offer, products and solutions to meet the industrial sector needs.</p><p>This aligned cooperation for creating demand and ensuring supply would benefit certain industrial sectors progress in their path towards decarbonisation. The goal is to move from custom-built project by project approach for each specific industrial plant and process, to more streamlined, standardised, turn-key solutions for industrial sector(s) and/or processes with similar energy needs.</p><p>Proposals are expected to facilitate the establishment of concrete collaboration initiatives, proving optimisation and integration of industrial heat pump solutions in industrial processes. Activities should include not only the assessment and optimisation of technical aspects but also the creation and exchange of knowledge and expertise, including guidelines on how to deploy the solutions, and the development and validation of business models for the deployment of the specific solutions explored in the sector(s) addressed.</p><p>Proposals should ensure dissemination and replication of the proposed approaches for wide deployment, including advising and building capacity among the relevant actors and initiatives as well as identify and map possible synergies with relevant funding instruments at regional, national and European level that could help build, disseminate, and exploit knowledge and results.</p><p>Involvement of the relevant user sector(s) and of technology provider representatives is recommended for effective market acceptance and implementation.</p><p>Proposals should focus on existing technologies already available on the market. Activities aiming at technological and first deployment on the market, including for products at Technology Readiness Level 8, are not in the scope of this topic.</p><p>For both scopes, proposals must be submitted by <strong>at least 3 applicants</strong> (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) <strong>from 3 different eligible countries.</strong></p><p>For Scopes A and B, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.</p><p>Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>Proposals should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.</p><p>For Scope A proposals should demonstrate how they will tackle the high-upfront costs of heat pumps in existing buildings through alternative business and delivery models. For Scope B the aim is to accelerate the deployment of industrial heat pump solutions in industrial sectors by developing standardised approaches.</p><p>Proposals under Scope A and B should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities.

Community-owned projects can allow citizens to finance sustainable energy investments that deliver local economic benefits, social cohesion, and/or address other priorities such as improving the energy efficiency of housing or reducing energy poverty. The role of energy communities in the EU energy systems is expected to grow in line with the REPowerEU plan. As part of that, for instance, the EU Solar Strategy defined the target of setting up at least 1 renewables-based Energy Community in every municipality with more than 10,000 inhabitants by 2025.</p><p>Developing and realising projects can be complex for energy communities due to the regulatory and policy context (e.g. changing national support schemes for renewables, burdensome licensing, heavy administrative procedures, etc.). For relatively small and citizen-led actors like energy communities, there are some additional practical challenges such as lack of information, limited access to finance, difficulties in aggregating small interventions or difficulties in engaging citizens and establishing effective governance and decision-making structures. These hurdles prevent energy communities around Europe from developing their potential.</p><p>An increasing number of local and regional authorities wish to make sure that more citizens and local communities benefit from the energy transition and play an active role in it. Supporting energy communities can be a way to achieve that and local governments are uniquely well-placed to support their development by creating an enabling framework for communities and addressing their development hurdles. Strategies to do so vary depending on the specific context of each territory. For instance, some public authorities may choose to directly (help) set-up and/or invest in an energy community, while others, may decide to open One-Stop-Shops (OSS) to support community energy projects, or procure public services and products from energy communities.</p><p>This topic aims to foster the collaboration between local/regional authorities and energy communities.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals should focus on one of the two actions below:</p><ul><li>A. Set up energy communities led by or supported by relevant public authorities aimed at supporting the achievement of local and regional energy policy objectives and actively and democratically engage citizens in investments and decision-making.</li><li>B. Develop support services for energy communities (e.g. One-Stop-Shops or other facilitation structures) supplying technical support to energy community projects by reducing the complexity of the process, simplifying decision making and stimulating the execution of projects. As a result of their work, these services should lead to local energy community investment pipelines. The design of the services is to be justified in each proposal taking into account the local context and existing support mechanisms.</li></ul><p>In order to deliver on the actions above, proposals are encouraged to consider including some of the elements below (among other possible actions):</p><ul><li>Provision of technical support to enable actors to set-up an energy community (e.g. licencing, energy commercialisation, business models, legal aspects).</li><li>Training and capacity building on energy community development for local and regional authority officials, local communities and other relevant local actors.</li><li>Creation of a supportive local policy framework for the development of energy community projects (e.g. through community participation or investment quotas or public procurement).</li><li>Support of active engagement and democratic governance by citizens in energy communities.</li><li>Facilitation of energy communities' access to financial resources (e.g. through guarantees, seed funding for revolving funds, technical support for the early stages of project development, aggregation of small projects).</li><li>Development of services to support the operational phase of existing energy communities and/or enabling communities to pool resources for project development and operation (e.g. by creating umbrella communities/coalitions).</li><li>Development of specific support measures (or streamline access to existing ones) for specific target groups such as energy vulnerable and energy poor households.</li></ul><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should aim at fostering communities fitting the definition of 'renewable energy community? according to the revised Renewable Energy Directive ((EU) 2018/2001) and/or the definition of 'citizen energy community? according to the Directive on common rules for the internal electricity market ((EU) 2019/944). They should adequately take into account participation and governance differences between both concepts.</p><p>Project applicants may choose to focus on one or more activities related to sustainable energy (production, transmission, distribution, energy efficiency, demand-response, etc.).</p><p>Priority will be given to proposals that develop areas in which community energy is less developed (in their specific context) including building renovation, heating and cooling or renewable gas market.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate the support of the stakeholders which are necessary to ensure the success of the action (in particular, local or regional authorities).</p><p>Pilots can be energy communities (A) or support services for communities (B). Proposals should justify the potential for synergies between the selected pilots.</p><p>Proposals should make use of existing initiatives, networks and platforms as relevant and demonstrate that the EU funding will be used in an effective way by delivering actions that complement existing initiatives (e.g. national enabling frameworks for energy communities and the European Energy Communities Facility).</p><p>Actions should contribute to fostering the collaboration between local/regional authorities and citizen-led-initiatives in the field of energy and build on the tools and resources of existing Horizon and LIFE projects, as well as initiatives such as the Energy Communities Repository and Rural Energy Community Advisory Hub.</p><p>Proposals should justify the added value of including the development of any new tools, guidance and platforms considering existing resources.

Projects under this topic are expected to develop replicable solutions that are mobilising private capital, blending public with private financing, setting up long-term and scalable financial instruments and at the same time overcoming legal and structural barriers. Projects shall demonstrate an innovative approach, for example in advancing existing procurement procedures, in aggregating and structuring investment projects, in advancing market boundaries, improving organisational and regulatory structures or in achieving high levels of energy savings and ultimately decarbonisation.</p><p>PDA projects contribute significantly to the European Green Deal goals and will help pave the way for a decarbonised and clean energy system. In the next years, PDA actions are expected to significantly contribute to accelerating the clean energy transition, as pointed out in the REPowerEU plan to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuel imports, and to contribute to the Green Deal Investment Plan, by stimulating market demand for Net-Zero technologies and assisting in their uptake. A range of very innovative solutions with regard to the financing and mobilisation of investments were demonstrated in past PDA projects (e.g. under Horizon 2020), which helped to shift market boundaries and demonstrate practical application of inspiring solutions. Examples include the development of a revolving loan fund combining European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding, low interest-loans and third-party financing through Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to deeply refurbish hospitals in a region, the development of a forfaiting fund using private investments, or the development of sustainable public real estate management and subsequent energy efficiency investments in municipal assets.

The European Green Deal's Renovation Wave aims to double the renovation rate of buildings by 2030, which requires also massive investment into the public building stock. In line with the REPowerEU plan to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuel imports, the public sector is called to play a key role in reducing its energy consumption through building renovations. The revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) requires the public sector at local, regional and national levels to reduce their total final energy consumption by 1.9% annually and to renovate at least 3% of the total floor area of their heated and/or cooled buildings annually, which should be transformed into at least nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB) or zero-emission buildings (ZEB).</p><p>Currently, a substantial barrier to increased renovation rates in the public sector is to create and sustain in the long-term the financial and technical capacity amongst public authorities to develop projects. In particular, small and medium-sized municipalities often do not have sufficient resources to dedicate staff towards developing a project pipeline.</p><p>The challenge remains to upscale renovations of public buildings to nZEB or ZEB standards and to demonstrate the exemplary role of the public authorities in decarbonising their assets and leading the way towards the European clean energy transition. Hence, facilitation structures (e.g. one-stop-shops or similar) are needed at regional and national levels that can support a larger number of public project promoters in designing and delivering ambitious renovation projects in the public sector at scale and capitalising on existing solutions. The experience from the technical assistance facilities (ELENA, H2020 PDA, eee-f) has shown that a range of competences are needed in public project promoters to bring sustainable energy projects alive, namely expertise in technical aspects (energy audits, project design), financial engineering (Energy Performance Contracts, blending different finance sources) and legal aspects (bundling, pooling, procurement, applying Energy Performance Contracts).</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals should establish and operate regional/national facilitation structures, for example one-stop-shops, to accelerate the renovation wave in the public sector (e.g. office buildings, social housing, schools, leisure facilities etc.) covering a larger territory and offering to public authorities a comprehensive, all-inclusive service from technical, financial to legal advice, procurement and quality assurance of works.</p><p>Actions should clearly focus on the ambitious energy renovation of existing public buildings (e.g. administrative buildings, hospitals, schools) to nZEB or ZEB standards, and should target legal entities operating under public law (e.g. public authorities, public bodies, social/public rental housing operators, etc.) as the main final beneficiaries of the services to be put in place.</p><p>Proposals should describe the services that will be developed and offered to public authorities, which should include:</p><ul><li>Reduction of complexity and simplified decision making for public authorities to stimulate demand for building renovation and energy performance improvements.</li><li>Proactive outreach to public authorities and identification of public buildings for energy renovations.</li><li>Renovation of buildings to nZEB and ZEB standards in line with the revised EED.</li><li>Provision of legal assistance to facilitate and prioritise the aggregation of building renovation projects (belonging to one or several public entities) with the aim to upscale overall renovation and attract private investors.</li><li>Development of efficient procurement processes ensuring that renovations are delivered at pace, enabling the bundling/upscaling of renovation projects and ensuring high quality of renovation works as well as facilitating the use of energy performance contracting and third-party financing mechanisms on a long-term contractual basis.</li><li>Financial engineering support to facilitate the use of financial instruments and market-based instruments such as Energy Performance Contracts, refinancing models, Green/White Certificates, energy efficiency obligation schemes, energy efficiency as a service, and to increase blended finance of public and private sources and uptake of EU funding sources such as InvestEU, Recovery and Resilient Facility and EU Cohesion Policy funds including REACT-EU and Just Transition Mechanism.</li><li>Systematic collection, aggregation and assessment of energy related public buildings data for informing local, regional or national policy developments and reporting.</li></ul><p>Proposals should clearly describe how they will achieve long-term sustainability of the facilitation structure. For example, this could include a clear outline of a sustainability strategy, business plan and/or dedicated tasks in the proposed work plan to that effect.</p><p><strong>Proposals may be submitted by a single applicant or by applicants from a single eligible country.</strong></p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of a range of EUR 1 million to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.

LIFE-2024-CET-DHC,Supporting district heating and cooling,LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,4000000,4000000,,46900460,46900445LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>To advance towards carbon neutrality and to phase out EU dependence on fossil fuels imports, there is an urgent need to reduce fossil fuels consumption for heating and/or cooling purposes. In that context, in particular modern and efficient district heating systems can connect local demand with low-temperature renewable and waste energy sources, as well as the wider electric and gas grids, thereby contributing to the optimisation of supply and demand across energy carriers.</p><p>The REPowerEU Plan, the revised Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED) set out ambitious measures, including the increase of the share of renewable energy and waste heat in district heating systems, and how to facilitate the achievement of efficient district and cooling networks. District heating and/or cooling operators/owners need to prepare and implement plans so that existing systems fulfil the criteria for ""efficient district heating and cooling"", defined in the EED. This will require, among other aspects, the integration of low-temperature renewable energy (e.g. from solar thermal, ambient energy and geothermal resources) and waste heat as well as the cost-effective and energy efficient retrofitting of existing, inefficient district heating networks. Furthermore, district heating has been identified as a key option for the decarbonisation of the heating sector in countries and regions without long tradition and experience in the technology.</p><p>The option to further develop district heating and cooling systems should be integrated in energy planning and heat mapping by public administrations, taking a district approach when addressing the policy priority of deploying renewable and efficient heating and cooling, including for instance building or modernising district heating systems when planning renovation programmes.</p><p>Guidance, recommendations and technical advisory services have already been developed and tested at the national and local levels. Notwithstanding, a large share of existing district heating and cooling systems still overly rely on fossil fuels. Additionally, the switch to low-temperature renewable energy and waste heat and the development of new systems in emerging markets is hampered, among other factors by limited human, technical and financial capacities. Technical support and enabling frameworks are therefore needed to support the preparation of modernisation and development projects.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals are expected to work either</p><ul><li>with operators/owners of existing district heating systems and provide them with the required technical support for the preparation of investment plans for the fuel switch of existing district heating systems to fulfil the criteria for ""efficient district heating and cooling"" as defined in the Energy Efficiency Directive. This can include the extension of existing district heating and cooling networks provided that they are fully based on low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat; or</li><li>with municipalities or relevant key stakeholders in the development of investment plans for new district heating and/or cooling networks, provided that they are fully based on low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat, and with particular attention to existing buildings.</li></ul><p>The focus should be on identifying and offering concrete ways to integrate low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat as defined in the revised Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>The investment plans to be developed should include the technical part and detailed identification of the investments, their timing, the internal and external resources required, the public and private funding sources, in particular for the first tranches of investments and the potential identification of alternative funding sources and models. Activities should include, among others, financial planning and pre-feasibility studies including, where relevant, the assessment of the compatibility with the existing building stock and options to link district heating retrofitting to local building renovation plans.</p><p>The investment plans to be produced should enable the targeted district heating system to fulfil the criteria for 'efficient district heating and cooling? as specified in the Energy Efficiency Directive Recast within a timeline of 10 years. However, the transformation into low-temperature of the district heating networks is not compulsory and other feasible approaches enabling the fuel switch to low-temperature renewable energy or waste heat are possible.</p><p>Proposals should support the development of a substantial number of investment plans in at least 3 eligible countries. Proposals should demonstrate, in a clear and convincing way, the commitment of operators/owners of the district heating networks that will be targeted for the collaboration, explain the content of the support to be provided and how the consortium will deliver this support on the ground. Additionally, proposals should engage and involve required stakeholders, in particular potential waste heat suppliers, work closely with the potential customers, provide an adequate risk assessment, identify barriers, provide recommendations for regulatory bodies, inputs for local administrations for the preparation of the local heating and cooling plans and promote replication through other district heating operators/owners.</p><p>Proposals under this scope are not expected to finance the equipment or development of new tools (e.g. software, or the upgrade of existing ones, platforms, applicants are encouraged to make use of existing commercial software, as needed).</p><p>In line with the Renewable Energy Directive, actions may also include the assessment of the potential to participate in electricity markets by providing balancing, storage and other flexibility services.</p><p>Proposals must be submitted <strong>by at least 3 applicants</strong> (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) <strong>from 3 different eligible countries. </strong></p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.</p><p>Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>Proposals submitted under this topic should demonstrate the impact of the supplied investments plans and guidance on the transition towards 'efficient district heating and cooling? networks, and on integration of low-temperature renewable energy and waste heat.

However, addressing several objectives, in the case that this is feasible, may provide an added value and should thus be seen as advantage for the applications in the cascading calls.</p><p>The third-party actions should focus on implementing innovative solutions that go beyond the state of the art and that combine, as appropriate, technological, nature-based, social, cultural, regulatory, and financial innovation, and new governance models. The actions should foster a participatory approach that empowers local stakeholders, builds on their local know-how and application of sustainable practices, and encourages their long-term commitment to the protection, restoration and de-pollution of our ocean, seas and waters and to making the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular. With the help from the project consortia selected under this topic,<strong></strong>the community-led third-party actions should promote the deployment and upscaling of innovative solutions to restore the ocean and waters, including through the preparation of deployment plans.</p><p>The community-led third-party actions should be encouraged to cooperate with scientific institutions to stimulate transdisciplinary innovation activities, which are based on best available science practices. Transdisciplinary activities denote cooperation of diverse societal stakeholder groups (administration, civil society, business &amp; industry, finance, etc.), not only across academic disciplines ('interdisciplinary').</p><p>These community-led actions should also consider an effective contribution of SSH (Social Sciences and Humanities) disciplines as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities. Social innovation should also be considered in order to match innovative ideas with social needs.</p><p>The proposals should encourage the third-party actions to build on research and innovation developed by projects financed under the current and/or previous EU framework programmes and other relevant EU and national programmes, linking also to the Mission Implementation Platform, and where applicable, make use of Copernicus/Galileo/EGNOS and Emodnet.</p><p>Attracting additional financing from Structural Funds or any national, regional, local programmes or private funding at any stage of the community-led pilot actions is strongly encouraged.</p><p>The types of Mission communities relevant to the cascading grants may include at least the following:</p><ul><li>ports (including inland ports);</li><li>islands;</li><li>fishing communities, aquaculture producers and other representatives of blue economy;</li><li>operators of various vessels;</li><li>Local Action Groups described by the Community-Led Local Development strategies</li><li>waterfront cities or regions / communities (avoiding overlaps with Cities' Mission);</li><li>conservation communities;</li><li>representatives of the tourism sector;</li><li>maritime infrastructure operators (incl. offshore platforms and their operators).</li></ul><p>Various types of actors in the communities listed above could apply for the support. These could include for example:</p><ul><li>regional and local authorities;</li><li>NGOs, foundations, professional associations, and other entities engaged in local development and nature conservation activities;</li><li>educational establishments;</li><li>locally based companies (provided this is not in conflict with the State Aid rules);</li><li>research performing organisations, etc.</li></ul><p><u>Cascading grants for transition agendas </u></p><p>Each proposed action should also foresee awarding at least 20 cascading grants for transition agendas of up to EUR 100 000 each, addressing the types of Mission communities described above. The proposed actions should ensure that the selection process of the third parties to which financial support for transition agendas would be granted is based on principles of transparency, objectivity, and fairness, in accordance with Annex B of the general annexes to this work programme.</p><p>A transition agenda for this call is understood as a strategic roadmap towards reaching all objectives and targets of the Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030' in the applicant communities, with a particular focus on the objectives that are most relevant to the specific community. The roadmaps could cover processes needed to ensure the protection and restoration of marine/coastal/inland waters, biodiversity and ecosystems, the reduction/elimination of pollution and the achievement of decarbonisation and circularity targets, as well as include a plan for a defined number of years concerning the objectives set, covering, for example, expected outcomes, results, impact, ways to achieve them and ways to bring in financing to support the achievement of these objectives.</p><p>The transition agenda should indicate how specific results and ideally also their impacts are expected to materialise in order to ensure the actual achievements of the objectives. These agendas would serve as a basis for further planning of follow-up activities by the actors involved, particularly actions to meet the Mission Ocean and Waters objectives/targets, to be subsequently implemented with the financial support of various funds (e.g., EU structural funds/national/regional funds).</p><p>All entities establishing transition agendas should commit to report to the project that had issued the third-party financing within 6 months after finalisation of the agendas on the progress of implementing its results in practice.</p><p><u>Technical assistance to Mission Communities of actors</u></p><p>The proposals should also foresee technical assistance to Mission Communities of actors in the basin addressed by the respective action. Such assistance should address the needs of the Mission communities of actors in the particular basin and may include support and advice needed for the preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, impact assessments, and needs assessment, as well as long-term sustainability planning to help the communities of actors develop sustainable financing strategies to ensure longevity of the efforts to achieve healthy oceans, seas and waters; capacity building to empower communities of actors with the knowledge and skills needed to undertake effective pollution prevention and elimination, conservation and restoration initiatives, as well as making the sustainable blue economy carbon-neutral and circular; and other Mission-related actions that would require direct counselling, written guidance, online materials, webinars, in-depths sessions, deep dives, peer-to-peer support, twinning etc.).</p><p>It is essential to tailor the support provided to the specific needs and context of each community of actors, including through the use of local languages, as well as fostering a participatory approach that empowers local stakeholders and encourages their long-term commitment to the protection and restoration of our ocean, seas and waters.</p><p>The proposals under this topic should also work on clustering of and support to the third-party community-led actions. The proposals should help create a network of these community-led actions to enhance communication, collaboration and sharing of knowledge and best practices to maximise their combined impact, and create links to the networks similarly created by the other three projects selected under this topic in other Mission lighthouse areas.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposals should assist each community-led action in using its experiences and solutions to establish new networks and collaborations in their respective areas. The proposals should provide guidance and support to the third-party actions in forming partnerships with local communities, NGOs, government agencies, or relevant stakeholders to expand the impact of the actions and create a collaborative ecosystem for knowledge sharing, resource optimisation, and wider adoption of successful solutions.</p><p>The proposals should provide help and guidance to the selected community-led actions regarding access to additional funding. The proposals should also identify, evaluate, and showcase feasible and scalable solutions demonstrated by the community-led actions, and provide guidance on deployment of these solutions.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposals should set aside funds for clustering and collaboration among four projects selected under this topic, including for a joint monitoring and evaluation framework to track the progress of each third-party community-led action project and assess their collective impact.</p><p>In order to ensure complementarities and avoid overlaps concerning the provision of all three types of support described above, the proposals should work closely with other Horizon Europe projects, particularly Prep4Blue, the relevant Mission lighthouse CSA projects (EcoDaLLi, BlueMissionAA, BlueMissionMed, BlueMissionBANOS), the project selected under HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-02, the public procurement prepared under Other Actions of WP 2022 'Studies to support communities of actors to achieve the EU Mission: Restore our Ocean and Waters objectives?, and the Mission Implementation Platform (MIP), notably with the work MIP does on deployment and upscaling of solutions. The proposals may also collaborate with and build on the experience of relevant existing networks, partnerships and initiatives, as well as take into account relevant strategic research and innovation agendas and regional strategies.</p><p>The projects resulting from this call should be implemented in close collaboration with the relevant EC service(s) and the Mission Ocean and Waters Secretariat to ensure a coherent and timely implementation of the Mission.</p><p>Proposals should be flexible enough to accommodate for some adjustments that may be requested by the Commission before the grant agreement signature to ensure complementarity of activities between the lighthouse CSA projects, Prep4Blue, the Mission Implementation Platform, and the project selected under topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-OCEAN-02-02.</p> <p><sup></sup>See pages 12-13 of the Mission Ocean and Waters Implementation Plan: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf"">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/ocean_and_waters_implementation_plan_for_publication.pdf</a></p><p><sup></sup>The Birds, Habitats, Marine Strategy Framework and Water Framework Directives</p><p><sup></sup>The four basins covered by the Mission 'Restore our ocean and waters by 2030': 1.

Activities will support Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 on protective measures against pests of plants and Regulation (EU) 2023/1134 on measures to prevent the introduction into, establishment and spread within the Union territory of <em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em> (Smith).</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:</p><ul><li>Enlarge the knowledge about <em>Spodoptera frugiperda </em>in the Union territory, including the influence of climate change, ecosystem degradation and globalisation;</li><li>Enhance capacities to prevent, monitor and (bio)control of <em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em>, developing economical and environmentally sound solutions for effective pest management;</li><li>Support related EU and Associated Countries' plant health policies, while promoting international cooperation.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p><em>Spodoptera frugiperda</em>, also known as fall armyworm (FAW), is a transboundary, highly polyphagous plant pest with an exceptional migratory capacity, which can severely impact yields of several crops, such as maize, rice, vegetables and cotton. It is spreading fast worldwide and towards the Union territory. Its presence was officially confirmed in Cyprus in January 2023 and later in the year in Greece, Portugal and Romania. Furthermore, the number of non-compliance with Union legislation regarding the presence of the specified pest on imported commodities has remained high, and the number of plant species in which the specified pest is intercepted has been increasing. Therefore, measures were set to protect the Union from the pest. The rapid and recent global invasion of FAW has led to an important need for knowledge surrounding its risks for plant health and agriculture and effective management options, in particular in the EU. There is a need to set out a comprehensive package of research and innovation actions adapted to the EU agricultural systems and practices for managing the threat.</p><p>Proposals should:</p><ul><li>Contribute to the understanding of the risk and impact of the introduction of this emerging plant pest in the EU, its spread and establishment including the biology of the pest and its interaction with host plants, the influence of climate change, ecosystem degradation, and globalisation;</li><li>Develop efficient survey strategies and integrated systems for early-detection and (bio)control of the pest(s);</li><li>Extend the range of tools and technologies available for the development of economically and environmentally sound solutions for an effective pest prevention and outbreak management, and if relevant pursue in line with the principles of integrated pest management and taking into account the use of non-chemical or biological control methods;</li><li>Develop breeding activities for more resistant plant varieties;</li><li>Analyse the social and economic implications for EU farmers, and other economic operators affected by the outbreaks of the plant pest and developing approaches whereby those affected can best cope with the situation. </li></ul><p>Given the evolving nature of the issue, regular updates and continuous monitoring of research progress are essential to identify and address new and existing knowledge gaps effectively. Collaborative efforts between researchers, policymakers, and practitioners across Europe may also help in bridging these gaps.

In addition to the partnership, sustainable livestock production will be enhanced by improved knowledge on nutritional requirements and innovative on-farm practices and technologies for optimised production and use of local feedstuffs. A common EU approach to optimise the management of the co-existence of outdoor livestock systems and wildlife will be implemented by integrating science, local knowledge and practice on the preservation, protection and valorisation of wildlife and agro-pastoral systems.</p><p>Synergies will be created with other destinations and instruments.

Thanks to R&amp;I, farming systems will also maximise the provision of a wide range of ecosystem services from more sustainably managed EU agro?ecosystems and landscapes and help reverse the loss of biodiversity while ensuring resilient primary production (Destination '<em>Biodiversity and ecosystem services</em>'). R&amp;I under the Destination '<em>Land, ocean and water for climate action</em>' will better equip farmers to make a significant contribution to climate-neutrality and become more resilient to climate change. Farmers will be empowered and interconnected by means of advanced digital and data technologies (e.g. AI, IoT, and robotics) that support sustainable farming approaches (Destination '<em>Innovative governance, environmental observations and digital solutions in support of the Green Deal</em>'). New sustainable business models and strengthened EU quality schemes will improve the position of farmers in value chains and enable them to seize opportunities provided by the green transition (Destination '<em>Resilient, inclusive, healthy and green rural, coastal and urban communities</em>'). Effective agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS) will speed up innovation and the uptake of R&amp;I results from farm to fork (Destination '<em>Innovative governance, environmental observations and digital solutions in support of the Green Deal</em>').</p><p>Better evidence-based knowledge and analytical capacity will help policymakers develop and implement effective policies, in particular the CAP post 2027, the contingency plan and sustainable food systems framework law, enabling farmers to transition to sustainable and resilient farming and food systems (Destination '<em>Innovative governance, environmental observations and digital solutions in support of the Green Deal'</em>). Furthermore, knowledge and innovative solutions generated under Horizon Europe will be circulated and tested in local innovation projects and networks that are financed by rural development programmes, and which are managed by the European Innovation Partnership for Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability (EIP-AGRI).</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture </em></strong>contribute directly to environmentally friendly, resilient, inclusive, safe and healthy food production by providing highly nutritional proteins, lipids and micronutrients for a healthy diet. Sustainable aquatic production can and should account for a much bigger proportion of our overall food consumption.

In addition, the new EU algae initiative - to unlock the full potential of sustainable algae-based food and alternative feed sources - can support the transition to sustainable food systems. R&amp;I will also contribute to the success of the common fisheries policy and deliver compliant, inclusive, diversified ecosystem-based fisheries approaches to allow fisheries management to adapt to different realities, including in the international context. The destination will also support the new policy initiative on the sustainable blue economy and its offshoot initiatives, including the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership.</p><p>R&amp;I will help fisheries and aquaculture become more precise, technologically advanced, and fully embedded in the natural and socio-ecological context including by reducing the footprint on aquatic biodiversity. It will better equip fisheries and aquaculture to become more resilient to the adverse consequences of climate change and to make a significant contribution to climate neutrality. It will enable the European aquaculture industry to achieve its full potential to ensure global food security in terms of volume, methods, variety of species, aquatic species welfare, safety and quality of products and services.</p><p>R&amp;I will help to provide a better understanding of the impacts of climate change in terms of habitat change and ecological functioning and the consequent repercussions on stock shifts, species composition, health, and altered growth and reproduction rates. This will help in the adaptation of fishing vessels, fishing gear and catch methods to reduce their carbon footprint as well as help in their adaptation to the changing climate regime. It will also enable aquaculture to: i) become more sustainable - by using resources in a highly efficient manner - and climate-neutral; and ii) adapt to a changing climate and its consequences, such as temperature rise, acidification, altered water quality and availability, extreme weather events, and other emerging risks, notably in geographical areas particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as the EU's outermost regions (defined in article 349 TFEU).</p><p><strong><em>Sustainable, healthy and inclusive food systems</em></strong> rely on systemic, cross-sectoral and participatory, multi-actor approaches and on integration between policy areas at all levels of governance. Food systems are to be understood as covering, 'from farm to fork', all the sectors, actors and disciplines relevant to and connecting i) environment protection requirements, ii) natural resources, iii) primary production on land and at sea, iv) food processing and packaging, v) food distribution and retail, vi) food services, vii) food consumption, viii) food safety, ix) nutrition and public health, and x) food waste streams.

This should occur in order to better understand the multiple interactions between the actors and components of current food systems, the lock-ins and potential leverage points for synergistic changes and of the interdependencies of outcomes (linkages between nutritional climate and sustainability outcomes). Such implementation/approaches can provide solutions that maximise co-benefits with respect to the four priorities of the Commission's Food 2030 R&amp;I initiative:</p><ul><li>nutrition and health, including food safety;</li><li>climate and environmental sustainability;</li><li>circularity and resource efficiency;</li><li>innovation and empowering communities.</li></ul><p>This destination will deploy solutions to the 10 Food 2030 pathways for action[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/86e31158-2563-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1"">https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/86e31158-2563-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1</a>]] and will help build innovation ecosystems to bring together relevant public and private sector actors, researchers and society. R&amp;I will provide food-related businesses, including those involved in food processing and packaging, retail, distribution, and food services, with opportunities and incentives to stimulate environmentally friendly, healthy, circular and diversified practices, products and processes that are biodiversity-friendly, climate-neutral and less reliant on fossil fuels. It will also help devise tools and approaches that enable the shift to healthy, sustainable diets and responsible consumption for everyone, boosted also by social innovation, technology, behavioural change and marketing standards, and by inclusively engaging with different consumers, citizens and communities.

Achieving sustainable ocean, water and land management, and using natural resources efficiently to help mitigate climate change implies finding the right balance between productivity, climate, biodiversity and environmental goals in the agriculture and forestry sectors, with a long-term perspective. R&amp;I activities will support <strong>solutions for climate and environmentally</strong><strong> friendly practices</strong> to reduce emissions of major greenhouse gases, other pollutants and the environmental impact of ocean and land use changes and agricultural activities.

In 2021, the Commission proposed to amend <strong>Regulation (EU) 2018/841 for land use, forestry, and agriculture</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0554</a>]] by setting an increased EU target for net removals of 310 MtCO2eq by 2030 and allocating targets for each Member State. The proposal also includes the aim to reach climate-neutrality in the entire land sector by 2035, namely that carbon removals should balance the greenhouse gas emissions from land use, livestock and fertiliser use. At the end of 2021, the Commission published a <strong>communication on sustainable carbon cycles, </strong>including<strong> carbon farming </strong>and<strong> certification</strong><strong>of carbon remov</strong><strong>als</strong>[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/system/files/2021-12/com_2021_800_en_0.pdf</a>]]. R&amp;I, new technologies and business models are expected to unlock the full potential of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities in the mitigation of climate change.</p><p>Carbon farming will be implemented in line with the communication on sustainable carbon cycles and related documentation. R&amp;I activities under this destination, and in the work programme of the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' will <strong>help coordinat</strong><strong>e</strong> the research community and key stakeholders in <strong>developing, testing and demonstrating</strong><strong>carbon farming practices and</strong><strong> in certifying carbon removals</strong>. Results of funded activities will help in managing land and forests and in delivering of multiple services provided by agricultural land and forests, such as: i) the provision of goods and long-term carbon storage in harvested wood products, ii) protection of soils, water and biodiversity; and iii) mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.</p><p>Specific attention will be given to paludiculture, complementing the activities of Cluster 5 in the 2021/2022 work programme. R&amp;I activities will help increase soil organic carbon, protect carbon-rich soils (e.g. grasslands and peatlands), restore peatlands and wetlands, and improve advisory services for land managers. Together with the work programme for the mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', R&amp;I activities will aim to reduce the financial burden resulting from the costs of management practices in carbon farming and the uncertainty about revenue possibilities. In the livestock sector, R&amp;I on manure management will help <strong>implement the EU methane strategy</strong>[[<sup></sup><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_methane_strategy.pdf</a></u>]]. R&amp;I activities will also boost the contribution made by a forest <strong>as </strong><strong>a natural and man-made carbon sink</strong> and maintain multiple ecosystem services (e.g., water replenishment, soil protection), as proposed in the <strong>Fit for 55</strong> package with the revised LULUCF Regulation and the new <strong>EU forest strategy</strong>.</p><p>Strengthening the <strong>nexus between the ocean and climate change</strong> is a priority for the EU. There is growing political awareness of the importance of ocean and polar regions as integral parts of the Earth's climate system and of the need to ensure the integrity and resilience of these vulnerable ecosystems in the context of climate change. The main outcomes expected are an improved understanding of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, resulting in the closing of the research gaps on ocean essential climate variables<strong></strong>and improved ocean models for seasonal to decadal forecasting at local and regional scales. This in turn will support decision-making aimed at preserving the integrity of the ocean and aquatic ecosystems and the polar Regions, through a better understanding of the drivers of change and of emerging threats, including tipping points. The ocean is also a large storage system for the global reservoirs of climate-regulating factors, particularly carbon. R&amp;I will advance knowledge innovations to develop ocean-based solutions/mitigation options, helping to close the emissions gap and stop ocean acidification and prevent the consequent biodiversity losses.</p><p>The following blue carbon ecosystem developments could be envisaged:</p><ul><li>more knowledge about identifying regions at risk;</li><li>exploring, preserving, restoring or even creating new natural habitats, and providing solutions to strengthen resilience and protection of EU coastal areas against climate change;</li><li>more knowledge and data on blue carbon quantification;</li><li>consider nature-based solutions for carbon farming, e.g. on coastal wetlands, as well as seaweed and mollusc aquaculture.</li></ul><p>Biodiversity protection plays an important role in all approaches for mitigation in ecosystems and Nature-based Solutions (NBS)are highly important in this context, providing further environmental, social and economic benefits. Building on the political momentum gained at COP25 where the ocean was identified as a priority, and on the latest developments at COP26, science on the climate and the ocean nexus developed under the Horizon Europe programme will contribute to and inform the dialogue under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (<strong>UNFCCC)</strong> on the ocean and climate change.</p><p>Other major contributions include: i) providing new scientific knowledge on polar regions for the <strong>EU Arctic policy</strong>; ii) supporting the new policy initiative on <strong>sustainable blue economy</strong> and its offshoot initiatives as well as<strong></strong>implementing the <strong>Marine Strategy and Water Framework Directives</strong>; and iii) helping to achieve the <strong>clean planet for all</strong><strong>'s</strong> aim of neutralising all major threats to the health of the planetary ecosystem.</p><p>In line with the <strong>climate adaptation strategy</strong>[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/adaptation-climate-change/eu-adaptation-strategy_en</a>]], climate action also calls for ecosystems, primary production, food systems and the bioeconomy to adapt to climate change. Climate change is exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure and food systems. Human activities relying on the availability and use of clean water are particularly affected by variable and extreme weather events, which may also lead to desertification. Agriculture and forestry in the EU are vulnerable to climate change. Specifically, there is growing evidence about the effects of climate change and extreme weather events, which need to be mitigated, on agricultural production, crop yields, and also on the forest sector.</p><p>In the area of forestry, R&amp;I will improve knowledge on the interactions and interdependencies between biodiversity and climate change, and identify win-win management strategies, also addressing trade-offs in a sustainable manner. Marine and coastal areas are also threatened by the rise in sea level, saline water intrusion, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, extreme events and a shrinking cryosphere. R&amp;I will, therefore, be critical to stepping up adaptation and building resilience in agriculture, forestry, and activities in marine and coastal areas. They will aim to deliver on the urgent need to step up the adaptation of primary production, notably by providing farmers and other actors in bioeconomy value chains with better-adapted crop varieties and animal breeds with lower impacts on the related ecosystems.</p><p>R&amp;I efforts are critical to avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification. They are also critical to delivering sustainable nature-based solutions that will also i) increase carbon sequestration, natural water retention, biodiversity conservation and restoration, ii) strengthen coastal protection, iii) reduce the risks of algal blooms and iv) offer ecotourism opportunities. Water adaptation strategies and approaches will be developed and tested. In this context, the innovation potential for a wide range of alternative water solutions (rainwater harvesting, storm water collection, water reuse and reclamation, brackish and sea water desalination, aquifer recharge, etc.) to be used for avoiding possible negative environmental impacts will be assessed and the European partnership for ensuring water security for the planet will be further supported. Potential trade-offs, and measures to mitigate and avoid them, will be assessed to ensure environmental sustainability and to keep the objectives of improving soil fertility, increasing carbon storage in soils and biomass to support benefitting agricultural productivity and food security and reduce biodiversity loss. R&amp;I will also aim at providing a better understanding of how institutions and behaviour shape vulnerability and offer opportunities for adaptation.</p><p>Expected outcomes include, by means of international cooperation, collaborative research on joint adaptation, mitigation and biodiversity reporting and monitoring of land contributing to the overall areas targeted in Cluster 6[[<sup></sup>This refers in particular to potential EU-China cooperation under the Climate Change and Biodiversity (CCB) Flagship.]].</p><p><u>Expected impacts</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this destination should set out credible pathways that contribute to <strong>climate action on land </strong><strong>- including forestland, grassland, cropland and wetland - as well as on oceans and water </strong>and more specifically to one or several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>better understanding and strengthening of the mitigation potential of ecosystems and sectors based on the sustainable management of natural resources;</li><li>advancement of science and technology to support the <strong>adaptation and resilience of natural and managed ecosystems</strong>, on land, in the ocean, in water and soil systems as well as economic sectors in the context of the changing climate, including interaction with drivers of biodiversity change and zero pollution;</li><li>efficient monitoring, assessment, modelling and data-driven decision-making support systems and projections related to <strong>climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation potential</strong> in order to derive solutions for tackling existing and emerging threats and support decision-making in climate change mitigation and adaptation policies at European and global levels, including through the use of AI and other digital solutions;</li><li>increased <strong>climate change mitigation in the primary sectors</strong>, including by means of reducing their GHG emissions and other pollutants, maintaining <strong>natural and man-made carbon sinks</strong> and increasing uptake and storage of carbon in ecosystems, taking into account trade-offs with regard to ecosystems;</li><li>improved <strong>capacity</strong><strong>to climate change</strong> of the ocean, sea, water and soil systems and related sectors to adapt to climate change, including by means of unlocking the potential of nature-based solutions;</li><li><strong>sustainable management of</strong><strong> scarce resources</strong>, in particular soils and water, therefore mitigating climate related risks, especially desertification and erosion, thanks to informed decision-makers and stakeholders and the integration of adaptation measures in relevant EU policies.</li></ul>",,,

This effort needs to be sustained through the rollout of ambitious training and qualification interventions aligned with the EU Green Deal, the EU's 2030 climate objectives as well as the EU's long-term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.</p><p>The first objective of the topic (Scope A) is to increase the number of skilled building professionals at all levels of the building design, operation and maintenance value chain. The focus is on the skills needed to enable the Clean Energy Transition, in particular the EU Renovation Wave, the EU Solar Energy Strategy, the Communication on Digitalising the Energy System - EU action plan, as well as the implementation of the provisions on skills as part of revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), and Renewable Energy Directive (RED).</p><p>The second objective of the topic (Scope B) is to create a thriving community of practitioners actively involved in upskilling activities for building professionals, which will support the large-scale roll-out of successful approaches across Europe.</p><p>The topic supports and goes beyond the Large-Scale Partnership for the construction ecosystem under the Pact for Skills, which plans to upskill and reskill overall at least 25% of the workforce of the construction industry in the next 5 years, to reach the target of 3 million workers, as well as the Renewable Energy skills Large-Scale partnership. In addition, the topic aims to leverage synergies with the initiatives on digital skills for the energy transition addressed in the framework of the Communication on Digitalising the Energy System.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals should address only <strong><u>one</u></strong>of the two scopes below. The scope addressed should be clearly specified in the proposal's introduction.</p><p><strong>Scope A - Upskilling and reskilling interventions enabling a decarbonised building stock and energy system integration</strong></p><p>Proposals under Scope A should develop, test, validate and prepare the deployment of new and/or the upgrade of existing training and qualification schemes for all types of professionals involved in the building value chain ('blue collars' and/or 'white collars' professionals), as well as for professionals active in other sectors than construction and buildings renovation. To ensure a successful deployment phase, the proposed training and qualification schemes should be tailored to the specificities of the national markets targeted; proposals should demonstrate a clear plan for deployment after project completion.</p><p>The main focus of proposals should be on Continuing Vocational Education and Training (or professional training) of professionals, i.e. after they have entered working life. This may include the retraining of professionals from other sectors with skills transferable to construction and building renovation. In addition to the above, proposals may also address other parts of education and training (e.g. initial education and training, higher education), provided this is justified based on needs detected in the countries targeted.</p><p>All professional profiles involved in the building value chain, can be validly addressed. Proposals should clearly justify the choice of the profile(s) and level(s) in the European Qualification Framework (EQF) targeted.</p><p>The proposed action should address <strong><u>one</u></strong> of the following thematic areas:</p><p>1. Skills development and deployment supporting the implementation of core provisions of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), covering one or several of the following:</p><ul><li>skills for carrying out building energy audits, including assessment and advice for preparing buildings to operate at low temperature and integrate heat pumps.</li><li>Skills for inspections, design, installation and optimisation of heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems, as well as hybridisation, digitalisation for smart home energy management and energy system integration.</li><li>skills to deliver building renovation passports.</li><li>skills enabling to leverage accessibility, fire safety, and/or seismic safety interventions for energy efficiency improvements.</li></ul><p>2. Skills development and deployment supporting the decarbonisation of the building stock, covering one or several of the following:</p><ul><li>skills for delivering building deep renovation, including through modular and industrialised solutions; training professionals in a cross-trade manner to allow for integrated renovation works.</li><li>skills for new and existing nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs) and bridging the gap towards Zero Emission Buildings (ZEBs).</li><li>skills related to whole life carbon (via the assessment of Global Warming Potential), circular construction and resource efficiency, and leveraging the Level(s) framework.</li><li>digital skills supporting greater energy performance of buildings, in particular through an enhanced use of Building Information Modelling.</li><li>skills for upgrading the smartness of buildings for greater energy performance (based on the Smart Readiness Indicator), looking in particular at sensors, building controls and building management systems.</li></ul><p>3. Skills development for solar energy deployment and energy system integration, covering one or several of the following:</p><ul><li>skills to increase the workforce of trained installers and maintenance staff, in particular for onsite solar systems; measures focusing on the identification of skills gaps in companies along the value chains combined with targeted trainings.</li><li>upskilling for energy systems related digitalisation to allow energy management in homes, buildings and energy communities, i.e. covering several buildings or larger areas and districts to facilitate system integration via electrification of buildings and transport, linking smart appliances, smart recharging with demand response and storage etc.</li></ul><p>4. Skills development for heat pump deployment, covering only <strong>one</strong> of the following:</p><ul><li>Reskilling interventions for professionals from other sectors with skills transferable to the heat pump value chain, including via partnerships between industry and trade associations, trade unions and public bodies to identify and attract suitable profiles.</li><li>Upskilling of professionals, including to integrate heat pumps as part of building renovation projects and for integrated solutions (e.g. heat pumps and PV together, hybrid heating systems). In that context, applicants may establish or reinforce cooperation between trades and/or among national associations and other relevant stakeholders to develop, test, and disseminate widely agreed EU-wide content guidelines for specialised training programmes, and core training material replicable and adaptable to local contexts.</li></ul><p>5. Development and delivery of innovative on-site training methods (especially for on-site workers/ craftspeople) as part of renovation projects, in cooperation with product manufacturers. Actions should focus on the skills needed to carry out deep renovation. The proposed methods should help address one of the main barriers to upskilling, i.e. the lack of time from companies and professionals to enrol in upskilling activities. The proposed training should ultimately facilitate the cooperation and understanding between different crafts and professions, and support a holistic vision of the building and of renovation works.</p><p>6. Skills development and deployment for the implementation and effective operation of integrated home renovation services (or one-stop-shops), providing coordinated and coherent responses to the needs of building owners at each step of their renovation journey: from technical and social diagnosis, technical offer, obtaining permits, finding qualified professionals, contracting of works, structuring and provision of finance (e.g. loans), facilitating access to available subsidies or other support schemes, to the monitoring of works and quality assurance.</p><p>Regardless of the thematic area addressed, proposals should:</p><ul><li>be tailored to the specificities of the national markets targeted and demonstrate their complementarity with and added value compared to already existing training and qualification schemes.</li><li>provide details on the actual scope and content of the training and qualification schemes to be developed/upgraded, i.e. professional profiles and levels in the European Qualification Framework targeted; details about the thematic coverage; duration of the training courses; involvement of stakeholders in the validation of the schemes' content; mechanisms for the validation of acquired competences, and future deployment prospects.</li><li>include activities ensuring the recognition (e.g. certification, skills passports, skills registries etc.) of trained and qualified professionals.</li><li>include train-the-trainer activities.</li><li>include a testing and validation phase for the new or upgraded qualification schemes developed; this testing and validation phase should take place during the project lifetime. It should take the form of training sessions for building professionals, during which participants will trial and test the draft qualification scheme, the curriculum, the training materials as well as the recognition mechanisms developed within the project. The testing and validation phase should involve a representative number of trainees, based on the size of the targeted sector(s) in the countries involved. After the training sessions, feedback collected from the trainees should be used to validate and/or further improve the qualification and training schemes developed within the action. Infrastructure costs for developing new or upgrading existing training facilities will not be considered eligible.</li><li>include activities to develop a strategy ensuring that the proposed schemes will be scaled up and sustained/rolled-out after the end of the project, linking to available sources of funding at national and EU level and pro-actively engaging national training providers and national qualification authorities.</li></ul><p>Proposals are also expected to include activities to engage relevant institutions in the field of energy, climate, education, employment, social and industrial policies. Applicants should notably foresee activities to engage employers, trade unions as well as education and training providers in order to ensure that training programmes and curricula are labour market-relevant and proactively integrate emerging skills.</p><p>Proposals are expected to leverage the work developed within the European Construction Blueprint which focussed on vocational education and training primarily for 'blue-collar' professionals up to level 5 in the European Qualification Framework. The proposed activities are also expected to align with and support the Pact for Skills in Construction as part of the European Skills Agenda.</p><p>Proposals under Scope A <strong>may be submitted by a single applicant from a single eligible country</strong>.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals submitted under Scope A requesting a contribution from the EU in the range of EUR 1 to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p><p><strong>Scope B - BUILD UP Skills community of practice</strong></p><p>The BUILD UP Skills initiative has funded more than 90 projects involving 32 countries since its inception. These projects have developed and tested a whole range of solutions and tools for skills intelligence, skills development and skills uptake in the building value chain.</p><p>Proposals under Scope B are expected to develop an EU community of practitioners with proven experience in the development and promotion of sustainable energy skills for building professionals in EU Member States and LIFE associated countries.</p><p>The community of practice should build bridges both within the group of BUILD UP Skills projects (past, ongoing and new ones starting during the project), as well as with other related projects and initiatives.</p><p>The community should foster pan-European collaboration and dialogue on cross-cutting issues, build and deploy collective knowledge, support and roll-out capacity building, increase market recognition, encourage convergence towards best practices and contribute to the development of partnerships between key actors.</p><p>The work of the community is expected to be structured around several working groups that will exchange on specific topics and produce relevant deliverables. Working groups are expected to meet on a regular basis (online and/or onsite as appropriate). Topics to be addressed by the working groups should include, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li><strong>Sectorial skills needs</strong>: e.g. circularity, digital skills, building smartness, heat pumps and innovative Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) technologies; skilled energy auditors, new generation of electricians etc.</li><li><strong>Skills recognition</strong>: mechanisms and approaches ensuring that trained and qualified professionals are recognised by the relevant public authorities and industries.</li><li><strong>Innovative training methods</strong>: reduce the constraints inherent to the training process and foster a better understanding between crafts and professions. Mapping of existing e-learning tools and possible interoperability.</li><li><strong>Demand side mechanisms:</strong> notably how public procurement can boost demand for sustainable energy skills in the construction sector.</li><li><strong>National skills roll-out:</strong> accelerate the large-scale roll-out of skills interventions. Notably following up on the implementation of the national roadmaps developed following the LIFE CET calls for proposals 2021 and 2022 and fostering the network of the BUILD UP Skills national qualification platforms.</li><li><strong>Funding sources:</strong> mapping available EU and national funding sources for skills deployment in the building sector, and their effective use.</li><li><strong>Synergies with other relevant projects and initiatives: </strong>notably the work done by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP), the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations classification (ESCO),<strong></strong>the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound)<strong>, </strong>the Large Scale Partnership for the Construction Ecosystem and the Renewable Energy skills Large-Scale partnership under the Pact for Skills , as well as relevant projects funded under the Erasmus+ programme such as the EU Construction Blueprint.</li></ul><p>Proposals should include capacity building, twinning and peer-to-peer learning activities at the national and EU level, focused on the practical uptake of tried and tested approaches. This may notably target relevant players such as public authorities, energy agencies, training providers, companies active in the building value chain, social partners etc.</p><p>The community should also develop effective communication actions to showcase the most relevant best practices to policy makers and stakeholders at all governance level (EU, national, regional, local), and notably promote the national roadmaps developed by projects funded under calls LIFE-CET-2021 and LIFE-CET-2022.</p><p>The Commission intends to select one single proposal under Scope B.</p><p>Proposals submitted by a single applicant or proposals covering a single eligible country are not considered appropriate under scope B. The community of practice to be established must be transnational and actively involve a variety of stakeholders from various eligible countries. Therefore, the Commission considers relevant that consortia gather a <strong>minimum of 3 applicants from 3 different eligible countries</strong>.</p><p>The Commission considers that proposals submitted under Scope B requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 2 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>Proposals should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.</p><p>Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators.

LIFE-2024-CET-BUSINESS,Supporting the clean energy transition of European businesses,LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,5250000,5250000,,46900460,46900430LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>Engaging businesses in the clean energy transition and reducing their domestic footprint is central for the European Green Deal and to deliver on the Fit-for-55 package and the REPowerEU Plan to phase-out EU dependence on Russian fossil fuel imports. It is also important for the Green Deal Industrial Plan and the overall competitiveness of the EU economy. Energy policy instruments such as the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) recognise the role that businesses, especially small and medium-sized, can have at local and national level in accelerating the transition.</p><p>As highlighted in the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the achievement of climate-neutrality by 2050 will require a full mobilisation and deeper cooperation among all players operating across the different value chains of Europe's net-zero industry. Exposure to energy prices, increased global competition as well as potential transition risks linked to changing regulation, market demand and buyers/suppliers procurement criteria are increasing pressure on EU companies. New business models and support schemes are needed to be able to achieve strategic EU objectives of energy efficiency and renewable energy production. The REPowerEU Plan strengthens the need to act fast.</p><p>Energy management systems and energy audits are instruments that the European Commission is encouraging Member States to roll out in the framework of the recast of the EED. Recommendations of high-quality energy audits can both generate energy savings in the short period and contribute to the competitiveness of the EU economy by optimising energy use for industrial, manufacturing and commercial purposes. Energy audit recommendations can also increase the self-generation and self-consumption of renewable energy e.g. with solar panels and heat pumps, amongst companies. Enabling factors such as physical proximity and value chain relations can also encourage businesses to engage in energy related collaborations and invest in energy efficiency or renewable energy.</p><p>The overall objective of this topic is to support the clean energy transition and decarbonisation of businesses by strengthening national ecosystems for energy management systems and energy audits as well as by fostering collaborative approaches between companies operating either in the same value chain or in physical proximity. Synergies with relevant EU projects and initiatives such as the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN) are encouraged. </p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals are expected to focus on <u>one</u> of the two scopes below. The scope addressed should be specified in the proposal's introduction. In case a proposal addresses elements of more than one scope, this should be justified.</p><p><strong>Scope A: Green Leap Forward for businesses </strong></p><p>Under the EED recast, energy management systems will become a default obligation for the energy-intensive enterprises, including SMEs, that exceed 85TJ of average annual energy consumption over the past 3 years. Otherwise, they will be subject to an energy audit if their average annual energy consumption exceeds 10TJ over the past three years. The implementation of energy audit recommendations is not mandatory, however they shall result in a concrete and feasible Action Plan, provided by the enterprise and transmitted to the management of the enterprise.</p><p>Applicants under this scope shall strengthen collaboration between Member States on energy audits and energy management systems, with a view to facilitating a harmonised approach and the implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency measures.</p><p>Proposals are expected to primarily define a common approach for the identification of enterprises falling under the scope of Article 11 of the EED recast based on their energy consumption. They shall investigate and propose solutions on how to approach businesses near the thresholds and those falling in different thresholds over the last three years before the energy audit obligation.</p><p>Applicants shall propose measures that can encourage businesses with an average annual consumption between 10TJ and 85TJ of energy towards an energy management system, and businesses with an average annual consumption of less than 10TJ of energy to undergo an energy audit and implement at least one highly cost-effective recommendation.</p><p>Furthermore, applicants shall develop a template for the Action Plan resulting from the energy audit. The Action Plan shall identify measures to implement each audit recommendation, including the potentials for the cost-effective use or production of renewable energy. In addition to energy savings and estimated costs, the template shall include a clear methodology for quantifying and valorising the non-energy benefits triggered by the implementation of the recommended measures. In this regard, applicants shall facilitate the uptake of such template and methodology in relevant international and European standards as well as national policy frameworks by involving relevant stakeholders, such as standardisation bodies and national authorities responsible for the implementation of Article 11 of the EED recast.</p><p>Digitalisation, eco-labelling of businesses, follow-up systems for checks on the implementation of measures, benchmarking mechanisms between companies and exploitability of energy data could also be addressed.</p><p><strong>Scope B: Fostering energy cooperation among companies</strong></p><p>Proposals under this scope should foster the market uptake of energy efficiency measures and the use of renewable energy (and heat pumps where relevant), through the establishment of collaborative approaches among companies. Applicants can focus on developing collaborative approaches, namely between large and small companies operating in the same value chain, or on energy cooperation among companies in physical proximity (region, cluster, industrial park/site).</p><p><em>Energy cooperation</em> and <em>collaborative approaches</em> refers to, for example, companies working in the same value chain and holding business relations. The value chains addressed can operate at any level (from local to European, and international when relevant). It can also refer to companies in physical proximity (region, cluster, industrial park/site) sharing energy related assets (e.g. renewable energy generation, energy networks, energy storage), sharing energy services, implementing energy exchanges (e.g. recovery and use of waste heat from industrial and manufacturing processes) or being involved in energy communities. Clustering of companies can also facilitate better access to finance, ESCO contracts and power purchase agreements (e.g. aggregators).</p><p>Proposals are expected to carry out activities aiming at triggering interest, awareness, knowledge and know-how on the multiple benefits achievable from collaborative approaches. Some examples of these benefits are operating costs reduction, mitigation of energy-related risks, easier access to finance or stronger value proposition (e.g. more environmental friendly products/services). Proposals should also work on removing barriers that hinder energy cooperation, e.g. organisational (coordination, trust, responsibilities, data management, risk sharing), legal or social.</p><p>Furthermore, proposals should facilitate the establishment of concrete cooperation initiatives, including but not limited to identifying, investigating and validating economically viable business models (based on concrete interaction with participating companies), proving the relevance of a collaborative approach in terms of value creation for each involved actor (e.g. buyers/suppliers/final users) as well as in addressing the untapped potential of energy efficiency and renewables at each step of the process (e.g. upstream to downstream in the case of value chains).</p><p>The proposed activities should be focused on engaging businesses in energy cooperation activities; the involvement of additional relevant stakeholders (e.g. industrial organisations, multipliers, financial players, ESCOs, public authorities) should be envisaged to ensure the success and the sustainability of the developed collaborative approach.</p><p>The proposed approaches should demonstrate a high degree of replicability and proposals should include a clear action plan to communicate experiences, critical success factors and results towards relevant energy cooperation actors and stakeholders across the EU.</p><p>Additionally, benchmarking and monitoring mechanisms, focusing on the energy use at value chain, or at cluster or industrial park/site level, could be developed to support the formulation of policy/regulatory recommendations aiming at speeding up the clean energy transition of the business sector towards the EU's 2030 and 2050 climate and energy objectives.</p><p>For all Scopes, proposals must be submitted by <strong>at least 3 applicants</strong> (beneficiaries; not affiliated entities) <strong>from 3 different eligible countries.</strong></p><p>For all Scopes, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives under Scopes A and B to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>Proposals should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts. </p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic should demonstrate how they will contribute to, depending on the scope: </p><ul><li>Improved quality of energy audits. </li><li>Harmonisation of energy audit frameworks and replication of best practices across participating countries. </li><li>Improved uptake of the recommendations of energy audits. </li><li>Implementation of EU legislation (in particular Energy Efficiency Directive and Renewable Energy Directive) addressing the business sector. </li><li>Viable business models for energy cooperation between companies ready to be rolled out on the market. </li><li>Deployment of energy related infrastructure, energy services, and/or energy exchanges contributing to the clean energy transition of businesses. </li></ul><p>Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project. </p><p>The indicators for this topic include: </p><ul><li>Number of companies benefitting from direct support. </li><li>Implementation rate of energy audit recommendations resulting from the proposed activities. </li><li>Number of energy auditors using improved energy audit methodologies. </li><li>Number of national/regional ecosystems supported for energy management systems and energy audits. </li><li>Number of companies implementing energy cooperation approaches. </li><li>Number of relevant stakeholders approached and mobilised at local, national and European level on energy cooperation approaches as defined per scope B. </li></ul><p>Proposals should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme: </p><ul><li>Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. </li><li>Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. </li><li>Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).</li><li>Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/year).</li><li>Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).</li></ul> <p>EC Communication of 01 February 2023 <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/41514677-9598-4d89-a572-abe21cb037f4_en?filename=COM_2023_62_2_EN_ACT_A%20Green%20Deal%20Industrial%20Plan%20for%20the%20Net-Zero%20Age.pdf"">A Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net-Zero Age', COM(2023) 62 final</a></p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2023_231_R_0001"">Directive (EU) 2023/1791 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 September 2023 on energy efficiency and amending Regulation (EU) 2023/955 (recast)</a>;</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302413"">Directive (EU) 2023/2413 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 October 2023 as regards the promotion of energy from renewable sources.</a></p><p>E.g. projects related to the clean energy transition of companies funded under Horizon 2020 Energy Efficiency (Coordination and Support Actions) and LIFE-CET.</p><p>E.g. projects related to the clean energy transition of companies funded under Horizon 2020 Energy Efficiency (Coordination and Support Actions) and LIFE-CET.</p>",,,,,

This is particularly needed for small and medium municipalities, rural and isolated areas, and carbon-intensive regions - which might also benefit from previous successful experience and know-how of frontrunners on similar challenges.</p><p>Delivering the energy transition in a holistic manner requires LRAs to put in place an integrated approach to implement sustainable energy actions, ensuring a strong political commitment, the allocation of clear responsibilities and the identification of appropriate resources and financing opportunities. This could be supported by robust and long-lasting organisational structures, with the aim of mainstreaming the carbon neutrality goal within all relevant sectors (energy production and consumption, buildings, district heating and cooling, mobility and transport, land-use, waste, water, health, etc.), mutually reinforcing sectoral policies and accelerating on the implementation. These new or existing structures could include, for instance, multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral teams within the LRAs and should facilitate timely and relevant dialogue and collaboration with other governance levels and key stakeholders.</p><p>Actions should consider potential synergies and cooperation with complementary EU initiatives addressing the role of LRAs in the clean energy transition, notably the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, the Clean Energy for EU Islands Initiative , the Horizon Europe Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission , ManagEnergy , BUILD UP Skills <em>,</em> and other potentially relevant initiatives. Existing technical assistance and private financing support initiatives such as the European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) Facility , LIFE CET Project Development Assistance (PDA), Smart Cities Marketplace , the EU City Facility should also be taken into account in view of accessing dedicated support for financing the implementation of sustainable energy actions foreseen under the local and regional CET plans.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Actions should provide technical support to a significant number of LRAs, depending on the targeted context, and build their capacities to deliver and implement ambitious short and medium-term CET plans and strategies for 2030 - with a potential to pave the way for the 2050 carbon neutrality goal - in coherence with the EU energy and climate targets and relevant policies and initiatives.</p><p>The focus should be on delivering the right mix of activities that will build/increase lasting technical, legal, financial, administrative and social innovation skills among LRAs with a clear aim to initiate the implementation of sustainable energy actions with an integrated approach in their constituencies.</p><p>Proposals should address one or more of the following bullet points, provided the proposed activities are relevant and coherent. Addressing more than one point does not necessarily increase the relevance of the proposal.</p><ul><li>Deliver extensive and in-depth capacity building programmes for policy-makers and public officers on the implementation of CET plans and actions. Capacity buildings programmes should be of scale, ambitious in terms of number of trained participants and volume and depth of the training offer, with lasting effects and tailored to specific needs and national languages, as appropriate.</li><li>Develop and pilot blueprints and integrated approaches that help municipalities develop and streamline actionable heating and cooling plans which align with the carbon neutrality goal and other sectoral policies. Bundle efforts at regional or other appropriate levels to provide support services for municipalities on this theme. Facilitate dialogue with relevant stakeholders, citizens and various governance levels including national authorities.</li><li>Establish and/or enhance organisational structures to mainstream the carbon neutrality goal and coordinate the implementation and monitoring of integrated clean energy transition plans and facilitate effective exchanges among different governance levels and active engagement of public and private stakeholders, including citizens and/or communities.</li></ul><p>Proposals must be submitted by<strong> at least 3 applicants </strong>(beneficiaries; not affiliated entities)<strong> from 3 different eligible countries.</strong></p><p>The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.75 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately.

LIFE-2024-CET-OSS,One-Stop-Shops - Integrated services for clean energy transition in buildings and businesses,LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,7000000,7000000,,46900460,46900380LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>As highlighted in the ""Renovation Wave"" initiative of the European Green Deal and in the REPowerEU Plan, there is pressing need to increase the number of ambitious building renovations across the EU and to better integrate the switch to efficient renewable-based heating and cooling as an integral part of building renovations. Businesses are one of the key contributors to the clean energy transition. However, many homeowners, building owners or small businesses lack the skills and capacity to set-up, implement and finance complex and ambitious clean energy transition projects. In addition, many project developers face high implementation costs, given the relatively small size of the investments and the lack of turnkey solutions, and have limited access to adequate and attractive financing solutions on the market.</p><p>This topic aims at supporting the creation or replication of One-Stop-Shops, proposing integrated services for clean energy transition in buildings and businesses.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic (depending on the specific scope) are expected to tackle, but are not limited to, the following aspects:</p><p>1. Improve market conditions and develop integrated building renovation service offers to:</p><ul><li>Reduce complexity, simplify decision making and stimulate demand for investment in energy performance improvements and decarbonisation.</li><li>Connect all relevant actors in the value chain (e.g. construction companies, architects, engineers, urban planners, financers, etc.).</li><li>Streamline access to various support measures, especially where there is support for specific target groups (e.g. energy poor households).</li><li>Improve awareness and trust towards such integrated services, through clear accountability, quality assurance and/or dedicated consumer protection policies.</li><li>Develop a robust pipeline of investments in building renovations, able to increase interest and participation from financial institutions and exploit synergies on the market, for instance via the development of dedicated financial products for building renovations mediated by One-Stop-Shops.</li></ul><p>2. Provide methods and support:</p><ul><li>Implemented, operationalise and test integrated services.</li><li>Build expertise and organisational innovations needed for project development.</li><li>Reduce costs and time on-site through standardised approaches (e.g. optimised business processes, standardised contractual arrangements, branding of the proposed services, district approaches, etc.).</li><li>Ensure cost effectiveness and price transparency of services provided to final beneficiaries.</li></ul><p>3. Aim at a self-sustained business model taking into account that:</p><ul><li>Integration of services can be developed through dedicated operators and/or through an improved co-ordination between existing local actors.</li><li>The prospect of economically viable business models is expected, targeting self-sustainability in the medium to long term, i.e. ultimately running without subsidies to cover running costs.</li></ul><p>4. Communicate results:</p><ul><li>Disseminate innovative solutions (e.g. organisational and contractual), suited to the targeted contexts.</li><li>Help improve legal and regulatory environments. communicating project results to competent authorities and bodies.</li><li>Demonstrate a high degree of replicability and include a clear action plan to communicate experiences and results towards potential replicators across the EU.</li></ul><p>Proposals should be well integrated in their local and national context, making best use of what is locally available, notably in terms of local market conditions and public support schemes, and contribute to develop partnerships between local authorities and the relevant market players, in the construction, heating and cooling, and wider energy sectors. The targeted territories and/or sector should be clearly identified and justified, notably segmenting and quantifying the potential target users, and a first detailed concept of the services should be presented in the proposal.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Based on the generic approach and common objectives presented above, proposals submitted under this topic are expected to focus on one of the three specific scopes below. The scope addressed should be specified in the introduction of the proposal. Although this does not exclude the possibility of addressing, in addition, some aspects of the other scopes, proposals must be fully clear on what the core focus of the approach is, and who the main final beneficiaries will be.</p><p><strong>Scope A: Integrated Home Renovation Services</strong></p><p>Under Scope A, actions should clearly focus on the energy efficient renovation of existing single or multi-family buildings in the private residential sector. Actions in ""complex buildings"" (e.g. coexistence of owner-occupied and rented housing; coexistence of private and social housing; coexistence of housing and business premises, typically on the ground floor; etc.) may be included in this scope. Specific approaches to deal with subsets of the residential sector (e.g. focus on condominiums, focus on energy poor households, etc.) are also welcome, as long as the main focus is on private non-professional homeowners (including homeowners' associations in the condominium sector).</p><p>Beyond the common objectives presented above, the proposals presented under this scope should meet the following specific objectives:</p><p>The services developed under Scope A should cover the whole ""customer journey"" of the homeowners aiming to renovate their home. Dedicated structures (legal entities or consortia of organisations) should provide integrated home renovation services, with the explicit intention of delivering services that belong in the competitive sector. In particular, proposals are expected to provide proactive support to homeowners ranging from technical design, obtention of permits, selection of qualified professionals, contracting of works, structuring and/or provision of finance (e.g. loans), to the supervision of contractors to carry out the renovation works and quality assurance. Those services can be implemented by public or private entities, either on a not-for-profit or for-profit basis. Proposals addressing only the provision of generic information and diagnosis, and/or limited to internet platforms without on-site interaction are <strong>not</strong> within the scope. Proposals covering regions with low development of integrated home renovation services to date will be given higher priority.</p><p><strong>Scope B: Integrated services for private rental housing energy upgrade</strong></p><p>Under Scope B, actions should clearly focus on the energy performance improvement of existing buildings owned by private professional entities operating under private law, with a core focus on rental housing. Examples of stakeholders that could be targeted by the services developed under Scope B are, among others: housing companies, housing cooperatives, real-estate investors, property managers (on behalf of multi-owner households or real estate investors), building administrators, non-profit organisations, etc.</p><p>Beyond the common objectives presented above, the proposals presented under this scope should meet the following specific objectives:</p><p>The type of integrated solutions developed must be particularly tailored to the specificities of rental housing in the local context, especially from a real estate portfolio management and asset valuation perspective. Services developed under Scope B should not be limited to first level information and generic diagnosis, but should also address: the development of strategic partnerships with construction companies and/or financial institutions (notably in the context of the EU taxonomy regulation, see 2020/852/EU); the development of dedicated financial and/or fiscal schemes; the development of a sustainable business model. Proposals should also pay particular attention to governance issues, e.g. developing a framework to facilitate decisions and conflict resolution among co-owners, or developing a framework so that tenants can participate in decisions and partly share risks and benefits, etc. Proposals addressing only the provision of generic information and diagnosis, and/or limited to internet platforms without on-site interaction are not within the scope.</p><p><strong>Proposals under Scopes A and B may be submitted by a single applicant from a single eligible country</strong>.</p><p><strong>For Scopes A and B</strong>, the Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of up to EUR 1.5 million would allow the specific objectives to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.</p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>Proposals submitted under this topic should present the concrete results which will be delivered by the activities, and demonstrate how these results will contribute to the topic-specific impacts. This demonstration should include a detailed analysis of the starting point and a set of well-substantiated assumptions, and establish clear causality links between the results and the expected impacts.</p><p>Proposals should demonstrate how they will contribute (depending on the specific scope) to:</p><ul><li>Integrated services implemented, operational and tested at the end of the action. Projects should necessarily set up and launch the services on a pilot phase, although upscale may happen after project completion.</li><li>Strong and trustworthy partnerships with local actors (e.g. SMEs, architects, engineers, ESCOs, financial institutions, chambers of commerce, professional federations and networks, local and regional authorities, energy agencies, NGOs).</li><li>Prospect of economically viable business models, in the medium to long-term running without the need for public subsidies to cover running costs.</li><li>Increased awareness and trust of end-users through clear accountability, quality assurance and/or dedicated consumer protection mechanisms.</li><li>Data and guidance made publicly available in order to facilitate replication of the approach by other market actors. Evidence that the value of the services offered is recognised by the market.</li></ul><p>Proposals should quantify their results and impacts using the indicators provided for the topic, when they are relevant for the proposed activities. They should also propose indicators which are specific to the proposed activities. Proposals are not expected to address all the listed impacts and indicators. The results and impacts should be quantified for the end of the project and for 5 years after the end of the project.</p><p>The indicators for this topic include (depending on the specific scope):</p><ul><li>Number of initial contacts (households, private companies) made by the integrated service provider.</li><li>Number of investment projects effectively implemented (number of housing units).</li><li>Average conversion rate of initial contacts into effective investments, demonstrating the value of the services offered.</li><li>Investments in building energy renovation triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).</li><li>Average percentage of energy savings per investment project.</li></ul><p>All proposals submitted under this topic should also quantify their impacts related to the following common indicators for the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme:</p><ul><li>Primary energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. </li><li>Final energy savings triggered by the project in GWh/year. </li><li>Renewable energy generation triggered by the project (in GWh/year).</li><li>Reduction of greenhouse gases emissions (in tCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/year).</li></ul><p>Investments in sustainable energy (energy efficiency and renewable energy) triggered by the project (cumulative, in million Euro).</p>",,,,,
LIFE-2024-CET-ENERPOV,Alleviating household energy poverty in Europe,LIFE-PJG LIFE Project Grants,LIFE Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-04-18T00:00:00,2024-09-19T17:00:00,,6000000,6000000,,46900460,46900390LIFEProjectGrants1713398400000,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>In recent years, European households have continued to spend an increasing share of income on energy, leading to higher rates of energy poverty and negatively affecting living conditions, well-being and health. Most recent estimates suggest that 9.3% of Europeans are unable to keep their homes adequately warm. Following the recent surges in energy prices, the number of energy poor households overburdened by their energy costs is likely to be on the rise. These higher prices, combined with low incomes and poor energy efficiency of buildings and appliances, are root causes of energy poverty. In addition to its causal multidimensionality, the phenomenon cuts across different policy sectors beyond energy, such as health, housing and social policy, requiring coordinated, holistic efforts at all governance levels, and involving different sectoral actors. While increasing the uptake of building renovation measures can bring significant long-term benefits to energy poor households, energy efficiency measures at the household level and increased use of renewable energy are also key tools in addressing energy poverty and can lead to lower energy bills and improved living conditions.</p><p>The European Green Deal sets out to ensure an energy transition that is socially just and inclusive. In accordance with the Fit for 55 package, and in particular the revision of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), Member States shall implement energy efficiency improvement measures as a priority among people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing. These households should be prioritised in the implementation of energy savings obligations, with the option of requiring obligated parties to achieve a share of their energy savings obligation among vulnerable customers and to work together with local authorities to do so. In addition, the EED (recast) underlines the need to address the split incentive dilemma and remove barriers to energy efficiency measures in multi-owner properties. To ensure more coordinated action on energy poverty, an EC Recommendation on Energy Poverty and accompanying Staff Working Document further set out a series of measures and policies that can be adopted.</p><p>In this context, efforts should focus on offering support to overcome barriers to the uptake of renovation measures in multi-apartment buildings requiring coordinated action amongst homeowners, as well as supporting relevant actors, including public authorities, in designing longer-term strategies and coordination frameworks to mitigate energy poverty at different governance levels, including dedicated financing schemes specifically addressing energy performance improvements for energy poor households. As obligated parties under energy efficiency obligation schemes have potentially at their disposal the necessary data and means to identify energy poverty and vulnerability among their customers, supporting the obligated parties is needed in order to spread such schemes across the EU.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Actions should contribute to actively alleviating energy poverty and build on the tools, indicators and resources of existing initiatives, such as the Energy Poverty Advisory Hub or the energy poverty pillar of Covenant of Mayors</p><p>The proposed action should cover maximum <strong><u>two</u></strong> of the following bullet points:</p><ul><li>Support the renovation of private multi-apartment buildings with energy poor residents, with a special focus on reinforcing and adapting the governance and decision-making structures of building management and homeowners or tenants associations, tackling related regulatory framework barriers (e.g. property and/or rental laws), split incentives (where relevant), and setting up and coordinating relevant support services. The renovation actions supported should take into account the ability of residents to remain in their homes to avoid gentrification.</li><li>Support national authorities in their obligation to empower and protect energy poor households by implementing the relevant provisions of the EED (recast). <p>This support should help analyse the national policy mix, and combine and pull the different energy poverty-related provisions together to allow for the effective and coherent application of measures at the national level. In doing so, the action should also support relevant authorities to evaluate the impact of different implementation options, taking into account the specific national needs and context on energy poverty.</p></li><li>Actions should facilitate the delivery of capacity-building for national, regional and/or local authorities and societal intermediaries, <strong>and</strong> support these actors in setting up long-term, cross-sectoral coordination structures to tackle energy poverty. Such structures could include setting up national energy poverty observatories. The actors involved are expected to represent all relevant sectors (e.g. energy, social, health, and housing) to ensure a holistic participatory approach to the alleviation of energy poverty in the long term and to improve social cohesion. This capacity-building should ultimately lead to the relevant actors co-designing and rolling out integrated interventions and support schemes for the benefit of energy poor households; however, it is not expected that such interventions or support schemes are delivered as part of the action.</li><li>Support obligated parties in setting up and testing schemes for energy efficiency improvement measures for the benefit of people affected by energy poverty, vulnerable customers, people in low-income households and, where applicable, people living in social housing under the energy efficiency obligation schemes of the EED (recast), including, where applicable, working together with local authorities or municipalities, and/or relevant networks such as the Covenant of Mayors. It is expected that obligated parties, in particular, are either directly involved or their support is clearly demonstrated in the proposal.</li></ul><p><em>For actions addressing building renovation actions without a clear focus on energy poor households, please refer to </em><em>LIFE-2024-CET-BETTERRENO</em><em>.</em></p><p><em>F</em><em>or actions addressing policy support without a focus on energy poverty, please refer to call topic </em><em>LIFE-2024-CET-POLICY.</em></p><p>The proposed actions should take into account multiple benefits from the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy measures for the different energy poor target groups, such as improved health, comfort, air quality, better social inclusion etc. Specific attention could be paid to particular groups which are more at risk of being affected by energy poverty or more susceptible to the adverse impacts of energy poverty, taking into account gender, where relevant.</p><p>The proposed actions should involve local authorities and intermediaries such as consumer or social organisations, energy companies, healthcare providers, homeowners or tenants associations, energy communities, as relevant.</p><p>Proposals should justify the need for the development of any tools, databases or platforms, considering their added value compared to existing ones.

In addition, actual energy consumption data would inform on the one hand future reviews of ecodesign and energy labelling rules, while providing added value for preparatory studies. On the other hand, it would also contribute to improving the ecodesign impact accounting model utilised for reporting the impacts of these rules. </p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals should set-up and implement in-situ measurement campaigns to capture the actual energy consumption, or energy efficiency where relevant, in EU households and to better understand the determinants of energy use for the selected products.

In order to meet the required level of investments, it is necessary to progressively maximise the mobilisation of private capital, using public funds as a catalyst, and to put in place an enabling regulatory framework. This has been at the heart of the works of the Energy Efficiency Financial Institutions Group (EEFIG) and will remain a central objective of the recently established European Energy Efficiency Financing Coalition. In addition, the revised Energy Efficiency Directive and Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aim to increase the cost-effectiveness of public funding and the mobilisation of private investments in energy efficiency measures, including by promoting innovative financing mechanisms. National Energy and Climate Plans provide a solid framework for Member States to evaluate and report on investment needs and gaps to achieve their 2030 national energy and climate targets, including regarding the mobilisation of private investments. The Smart Cities Marketplace offers an investor matchmaking platform for investments in clean energy, ICT solutions and sustainable mobility.</p><p>While significant public sector expenditure is allocated to leverage private finance for energy efficiency and small-scale renewables (e.g. through the InvestEU facility), most private investors still view this type of investments as risky, complex and/or insufficiently profitable. This is due to the limited availability of investment opportunities which comply with the requirements of financial institutions in terms of size, scale, standardisation and transaction costs. There is a need to set up and roll-out private financing schemes which can be expanded and/or replicated at scale, and contribute to the national strategies to achieve the 2030 energy efficiency targets and the building renovation policy objectives. These schemes have to be adapted to the specificities of energy efficiency investment profiles, as well as those of small-scale renewables, in buildings, SMEs, district heating and other relevant sectors.</p><p>The financing schemes can be initiated by private sector stakeholders or local and regional authorities, as well as other types of actors.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals should clearly focus on tailored, market-oriented solutions to crowd in private finance at scale for sustainable energy investments, understood as investments in energy efficiency and/or small-scale renewable energy sources and storage.</p><p>Proposals should set-up innovative financing schemes leveraging private finance for sustainable energy investments, with a dedicated and clear focus on energy efficiency, in at least 1 eligible country with a clear ambition and effort towards expansion in additional eligible countries. The financing scheme should be operational by the end of the project, whereas the related investments may be implemented after project completion.</p><p>The financing schemes can involve, for example, but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Equity, debt, mezzanine financing, potentially combined with non-reimbursable grants ('blending?).</li><li>Local or regional investment funds, including blended financing. Guarantees, risk-sharing, insurances or other de-risking instruments.</li><li>Energy services such as energy performance contracting, efficiency as a service, and variants thereof, if used to finance the investments.</li><li>On-bill, on-tax and building-based financing, where the debt is attached to the energy meter or the building rather than the household or company.</li><li>Schemes complementing, with a dedicated financing component, already existing local and regional technical assistance facilities, in particular integrated home renovation services.</li><li>Schemes targeting the secondary market, including refinancing mechanisms, specialised securitisation vehicles and green bond schemes.</li><li>Local investment structures, including citizen financing (e.g. crowdfunding) for energy efficiency.</li><li>Market-based instruments relevant for sustainable energy (e.g. carbon finance instruments, energy efficiency obligations, etc.).</li><li>Brokering, aggregation or clearing houses, which facilitate matching of demand and supply of sustainable energy finance.</li></ul><p>Proposals should take into account all the following elements:</p><ul><li>Establish an innovative, operational financing scheme for energy efficiency and/or integrated renewables in at least 1 eligible country.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Creating, enriching and refining annotated bibliographies</li><li>Documenting the results of fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological excavations or other collection processes and studies</li></ul><p><strong>Creating, enriching and refining annotated bibliographies</strong></p><p>A crucial task in both education and professional duties within cultural heritage is compiling bibliographies. This time-consuming activity entails gathering relevant literature on a cultural heritage object, entering bibliographic references in a list, assessing each document, and producing notes that are subsequently saved in the bibliography. This work has a value of its own, not only as part of the papers or reports created. Bibliographies therefore ought to be kept on the ECCCH, made accessible, and further enriched, refined and extended by collaborative and supervised efforts.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should make sure that the ECCCH offers tools that automate much of the tedious tasks, and support cooperative work and re-use. Existing tools and bibliographic frameworks should be evaluated and when appropriate built upon. The tools to be developed should offer significant added value to its users beyond what is currently available, and should be developed based on the data model of the ECCCH, gathering data from and incorporating data in the ECCCH. These tools may, to the extent feasible, include functionality to parse and enrich data from for instance retrodigitised sources not readily machine readable. Given a topic or a specific heritage object and/or a small initial set of papers selected by the user, enhanced AI technologies working on text or/and on images should be able to retrieve related works, evaluate the fit of a given paper with the subject of the research, and produce a preliminary bibliography. The authoring system should support the creation, editing, and annotation of bibliographies. It should be possible to define with whom the results are shared (e.g. with a restricted group of professionals or with all users).</p><p><strong>Documenting the results of fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological excavations or other collection processes and studies</strong></p><p>Fieldwork such as archaeological or paleontological exploration and research typically produce large amounts of different kinds of data, such as survey documentation and documents presenting, narrating and interpreting the findings, photographic data, 3D models, drawings, maps and geographic information system data. At a later stage, most of the findings become assets for cultural heritage institutions such as museums. Such activities (excavation, study, etc.), thus, are a crucial phase of the musealisation process. Moreover, most countries enforce legal obligations regarding the archiving of data produced by excavations, as well as periodic reports.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should offer a set of tools that makes the ECCCH a valuable resource for the community involved in such excavations and studies, using an extensible data model based on semantic technology, as well as a repository for the produced data, together with appropriate data visualisation and analysis instruments. Regulated reporting and archiving obligations in different countries should be analysed, and to the extent possible semi-automatised.</p><p>Ontologies and vocabularies should be extended as needed to define the data structures and relationships between different data, in view of achieving interoperability. Repositories from different institutions and countries should be inter-operable and inter-connected. The semantic information layer should make it possible for AI technologies to access and ""learn"" from the archive. An extension to the ECCCH 3D browser should provide an interactive and visual interface to excavation data, and to the related findings.</p><p>Also, citation capabilities should be integrated, to facilitate publication, sharing and reuse of data. Authoring tools should provide a way for the user to build ""narratives"" starting from the archival data.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>In particular, in order to exploit potential synergies, proposals may consider, where appropriate, to build on the work of the projects funded under the topics HORIZON-INFRA-2021-EOSC-01-04 and HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-03, especially concerning Science Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) as flexible tools to monitor and track events of science linked to provenance, publishing, citation, data processing, data and software usage, as well as service consumption.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.</p><p>Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.</p><p>The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.</p><p>Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.</p><p>The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.</p><p>Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.</p> <p>'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.</p><p>'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.</p><p>""Narratives"" in this context means all documents that use, as their building blocks, the data entities contained in the archive, such as periodic reports, formulation of new interpretations or confutation/discussion of the already existing ones, preparation of scientific papers and publications, set-up of teaching/didactic material, schemes and graphs.</p><p>This by no means imply that partners from such projects need to be part of the consortium.</p>",,"<p>Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[<sup></sup>The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en"">https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en</a>]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.</p><p>The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[<sup></sup>Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? (ECCCH).</p><p>An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[<sup></sup>European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv�nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014</a>]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.</p><p>The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[<sup></sup>See further <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces</a>]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.</p><p>Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:</p><ul><li>The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[<sup></sup>In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.</li><li>The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.</li><li>Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.</li><li>To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.</li><li>The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: <ul><li>digital twins of heritage objects,</li><li>digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,</li><li>digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role.</li> </ul></li><li>The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.</li><li>An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.</li><li>The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.</li><li>The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe.

The focus should be exclusively on adolescent and young adult (AYA, age range 15-39) cancer patients and survivors.</p><p>Each year, more than 150,000 AYA cancers are diagnosed in the EU, and over 1.2 million worldwide. About 300,000 AYA patients live with or beyond cancer in the EU; the majority experience late-effects due to their cancer treatment, including chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, organ and skin alterations, cosmetic sequelae, fertility problems, cognitive and functional impairment, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Survivors may also be at increased risk of second cancers due to the long-term effects of radiation and chemotherapy. The negative impact on education and employment of AYA survivors and in general the financial burden borne by them is also commonly observed.</p><p>Late effects are particularly challenging for AYA cancer survivors, who often experience them during a critical phase of their lives. Late effects are also challenging for caregivers.

It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong> and to accelerate their transformation to become <strong>climate resilient. </strong>By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

The CVD risk has been acknowledged by WHO's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.4 which aims to reduce heart disease rates by one-third by 2030<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>. Trends in the EU27 and the UK from 1961 to 2018 show a decline in the share of the total population living in rural areas, while towns and cities experienced a smooth and constant population increase. Europe's level of urbanisation was 75% in 2022<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> and is expected to increase to approximately 83.7% in 2050<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. In cities, CVD risks are amplified by factors like pollution, scarcity of green spaces and stressful lifestyles. The trend towards urbanisation often leads to significant healthcare disparities and worsening of CVD outcomes especially among underserved and disadvantaged communities. Thus, an improvement of the management of CVD in cities would be of significant benefit for the great majority of the European citizens living in an urban context.</p><p>The focus of this topic is on identifying and creating scalable models, interventions, and practices to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of CVD management based on existing (e.g. <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.novartisfoundation.org/transforming-population-health/cardio4cities"">Cardio4Cities</a>) <strong><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37040342/"">[2]</a></strong>or new pilots in up to 5 cities, to build evidence for replication across Europe in different socio-economic conditions.

The identified solutions for improvement should be based on data-driven insights to identify multi-sectorial interventions that improve the management of CVD risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and prevent these risks from developing. They should also consider the entire continuum of care (detect, treat, control). The work on performance indicators including harmonisation is key to set a baseline from which improvements can be made.

These adaptive tools are meant to address challenges arising from the acceleration of technological/scientific advances and the mechanisms intended to regulate them. It offers customisation in terms of how a regulatory framework can be applied, combined with appropriate safeguards.</p><p>Regulatory sandboxes, first tested in the fintech sector (2015), are starting to transform the traditional methods used by regulatory agencies in the health sector to accompany the development of safe, efficacious, and high-quality health technologies<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>, which, due to their level of novelty, challenge the current regulatory framework. The mechanism enables breakthrough developments and the testing of alternative regulatory approaches for disruptive innovations for medicinal products, related platforms and their combinations, including where appropriate medical and digital technologies. Regulatory sandboxes are mentioned as important future-proofing elements in the legislative proposal<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> of the European Commission on the general pharmaceutical legislation. The European Commission's communication to boost biotechnology and biomanufacturing in the EU further promotes the establishment of regulatory sandboxes that allow the testing of novel solutions in a controlled environment for a limited amount of time under the supervision of regulators as a way of quickly bringing more of them to the market<sup><strong>3</strong></sup>. Regulatory sandboxes are not featured in the medical devices and <em>in vitro</em> diagnostics regulations (MDR and IVDR)<sup><strong>4</strong></sup>, but the artificial intelligence (AI) Act<sup><strong>5</strong></sup> creates an opportunity for regulatory sandboxes focused on case studies for AI-enabled medical devices. Regulatory sandboxes entail a shared learning objective for innovators (finding a pathway and getting regulatory predictability) and regulators (understanding the technology and defining how best to regulate it). The mechanism helps to inform future regulation through experimentation and evidence generation and minimises the risks of regulating ex-ante innovative and novel approaches prematurely or inappropriately. For the same reasons regulatory sandboxes also potentially facilitate the more efficient or rapid subsequent adaptation of the legislation either through translation into an adapted regulatory framework and/or through recommendations when the time comes for revising existing or developing new legislation.</p><p>Regulatory sandboxes should be able to experiment and draw on several relevant healthcare innovation related frameworks other than pharmaceutical products (i.e. medical devices, <em>in-vitro</em> diagnostics, AI, digital health technologies, and substances of human origin among others). Due to their anticipatory and adaptive nature, regulatory sandboxes are well placed to address gaps and complexity within and across regulatory frameworks. Indeed, as the number of drug and device combinations increases, and technology integration becomes the norm rather than an exception in healthcare innovation R&amp;D, manufacturing and healthcare delivery, the current siloed technology-specific frameworks may not provide a clear path forward. To that end, when considering an innovation, it is important to consider all relevant legislative frameworks including MDR and IVDR, the Clinical Trials Regulation<sup><strong>6</strong></sup>, the General Product Safety Regulation<sup><strong>7</strong></sup> and AI ACT among others.</p><p>Although still new to the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector, there are a few examples of regulatory sandboxes such as the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/about-health-canada/activities-responsibilities/strategies-initiatives/health-products-food-regulatory-modernization/advanced-therapeutic-products.html"">Sante Canada sandbox for advanced therapeutic products</a> or the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.moh.gov.sg/home/our-healthcare-system/licensing-experimentation-and-adaptation-programme-(leap)---a-moh-regulatory-sandbox"">Singapore sandbox to test telemedicine</a>.

The topic should also enable the development of a cross-sectoral community of stakeholders including pharma and medical device companies, regulators, and health technology assessment bodies (HTAs), among other stakeholders.</p><p>To fulfil this aim, the proposal should:</p><p><strong>1. Scan the horizon for potential sandbox candidates including how sandboxes provide an additional tool to existing frameworks, and use the examples identified to model the process.</strong></p><p>To this end, a key objective is to identify a number of healthcare innovation case studies to better understand how a regulatory sandbox could be used to solve further-defined challenges at an existing regulation level and inform recommendations for end-to-end operations. These cases could draw from the past, present and from horizon scanning activities (the EMA's work in this area already provides a hint<sup><strong>8</strong></sup>) to anticipate future innovations, looking across their development value chain.</p><p><strong>2. Analyse how regulatory sandboxes can drive science and health technology innovation in an evolving environment.</strong></p><p>The proposal should do this by:</p><ul><li>anticipating consequences for health technology development under a regulatory sandbox mechanism, acknowledging its time-limited scope and the consequences (considering the technical particularities of healthcare innovation) for other downstream activities e.g., standardisation, health technology assessment;</li><li>proactively identifying any guardrails and mitigation measures.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Develop recommendations for end-to-end operations of regulatory sandboxes to inform healthcare innovation developers, regulators and downstream decision makers. </strong></p><p>The proposal should do this by:</p><ul><li>mapping out conceptual elements and operationalisation features of future sandbox mechanisms based on existing experiences in other fields such as governance, conditions fostering dialogue and collaboration, access to the right type of expertise, support, regulatory customisation, sharing/communicating lessons learned and their translation via the appropriate frameworks into new standards, among other elements to be further defined;</li><li>modelling how to operationalise the sandbox(es) (including governance, operations, principles) and how they could be used in healthcare innovation development and evaluation in conjunction with existing regulatory mechanisms to advance innovation at European and national levels.</li></ul><p>Part of the topic entails modelling a regulatory sandbox. The proposal should therefore consider good practices for designing and evaluating the necessary operating models to ensure the robustness and future applicability of the output of the project.</p><p>The project outcomes could also offer directions for the translation of the resulting recommendations into digital tools and systems deemed necessary for the functioning of regulatory sandboxes (e.g. ensuring collaboration between different health authorities' triage mechanisms, horizon scanning, fitness check evaluations), as relevant.</p><p>When developing a comprehensive and shared understanding of the value of regulatory sandboxes, applicants will have to explore key aspects across the life-cycle of healthcare innovations with the objective of accompanying their ultimate adoption, which could include as appropriate R&amp;D, regulatory authorities, HTA bodies, payers, governments, clinicians and patients. Ethical considerations would also have to be considered as some innovations could trigger questions in this field.A shared objective should include to develop a regulatory strategy and interaction plan for generating appropriate evidence, enabling engagement across all the different decision makers in a timely manner (e.g. national competent authorities, EMA and the respective Innovation Task Force, qualification advice) and identifying aspects that can be leveraged by existing regulatory tools, as well as the limiting aspects and the flexibilities that would be required under a regulatory sandbox to achieve the timely development and access of healthcare innovations.</p><p><sub><sup><strong>1 </strong></sup>'health technology' means a medicinal product, a medical device or medical and surgical procedures as well as measures for disease prevention, diagnosis or treatment used in healthcare.</sub></p><p><sub><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and establishing rules governing the European Medicines Agency, amending Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 and Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52023PC0193"">Chapter IX Regulatory Sandbox (Articles 113-115)</a></sub></p><p><sub><sup><strong>3</strong></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/47554adc-dffc-411b-8cd6-b52417514cb3_en"">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/document/download/47554adc-dffc-411b-8cd6-b52417514cb3_en</a></sub></p><p><sub><sup><strong>4 </strong></sup>Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.</sub></p><p><sub><sup><strong>5 </strong></sup>Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act).</sub></p><p><sub><sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on clinical trials on medicinal products for human use.</sub></p><p><sub><sup><strong>7 </strong></sup>Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 on general product safety.</sub></p><p><sub><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> Health horizons: Future trends and technologies from the European Medicines Agency's horizon scanning collaborations: <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2022.1064003/full"">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.1064003</a>.</sub></p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>The action under this topic is expected to achieve the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Meaningful contributions to the successful implementation of regulatory sandboxes through developing a comprehensive and shared understanding of their use and value among key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem;</li><li>Support the future-proofing of the EU regulatory framework by design, enabling the efficient implementation of regulatory sandboxes where and when appropriate, and thus helping to make Europe more attractive as place of innovation;</li><li>Enhancing and enabling the cooperation of key healthcare stakeholders, including patients, clinicians, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and academics, with regulators in developing a competitive and innovation-friendly landscape;</li><li>Fostering interaction with regulators to develop healthcare solutions when it is not possible to develop them within the current framework.</li></ul><p>The action will also contribute to a number of European policies/initiatives, which include:</p><ul><li>the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/pharmaceutical-strategy-europe_en"">European Commission's Pharmaceutical Strategy</a><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://health.ec.europa.eu/medicinal-products/pharmaceutical-strategy-europe_en""> for Europe</a>, </u>specifically the pillar on competitiveness, innovation and sustainability;</li><li>related measures under the ongoing revision of the Pharmaceutical legislation;</li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/support-policy-making/shaping-eu-research-and-innovation-policy/new-european-innovation-agenda_en"">the European Commission innovation agenda</a> (published in 2022) flagship initiative '<em>Enabling innovation through experimentation spaces and public procurement</em>?

They can measure the status of a patient's health in ways that may be related to, but often differ from, COAs. For example, DHTs may measure activity intensity but not specific activities. Likewise, DHT-derived measures may detect changes in patient-centred outcomes - such as function - earlier than a patient may notice such a change. For patient-centred DHT-derived measures (i.e., DHT-derived measures that capture how a patient feels and functions) to be useful as endpoints in clinical studies, they must not only be technically validated, but also demonstrate that they measure functions, activities, symptoms, and other impacts of disease and treatment that are important to patients and measure changes in these outcomes that are meaningful to patients.</p><p>PPI, COAs, and DHT-derived measures are different, but complementary, types of patient-centred data. Because these measures are complementary, using these measures in combination will provide a more robust view of the benefits of therapies measured using DHT-derived endpoints from the patient perspective. Combining these complementary measures is necessary to demonstrate the utility of using DHT-derived measures as clinical study endpoints that reflect the value of treatment benefits to patients. Specifically, using these measures in combination may contribute to determining what constitutes a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in patient-centred DHT-derived endpoints from the patient perspective in clinical studies of therapies to treat chronic diseases. For the purpose of this project, a chronic disease is defined as a long-term health condition that may not have a cure.</p><p>However, despite recent increases in the use of PPI, COAs, and patient-centred DHT-derived measures, there is no unifying framework for understanding the relationships among these measures, nor how they can be used in combination to demonstrate meaningful, patient-centred benefits of therapies for chronic diseases in clinical studies.</p><p>Therefore, uncertainties exist regarding the utility of these measures either alone or in tandem, and the meaningfulness to patients of patient-centred DHT-derived measures when used as clinical study endpoints in the development of therapeutic products (including, but not limited to, pharmaceutical products, combination products, and therapeutic devices) for the treatment of chronic diseases.</p><p>The topic aims to develop a unified framework and consensus-based recommendations for using multiple types of patient-centred information to support the use of DHT-derived endpoints to demonstrate therapeutic benefit. This will ensure that therapies addressing patients' needs are approved for use and reimbursed at levels that reflect the value of the therapies to patients.</p><p>To fulfil this aim, the action funded under this topic must:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Develop a framework for using PPI, COAs, and DHT-derived measures in combination for the development, acceptance and implementation of patient-centred DHT-derived clinical-study endpoints in clinical studies of potential treatments for chronic diseases.</p><p>The framework will be designed to ensure that PPI, COAs, and patient-centred DHT-derived measures used in combination will be accepted as reliable evidence to support the use of DHT-derived clinical study endpoints in the evaluation of the clinical and economic benefit of therapeutic drugs and technologies.</p><p>The framework must:</p><ul><li>include recommendations for using the three types of patient-centred data in addition to or in combination with traditional clinical-study endpoints to provide evidence of the patient-centred benefits of therapeutic drugs and technologies;</li><li>describe the potential relationships among COAs, patient-centred DHT-derived endpoints and other common types of clinical study endpoints;</li><li>identify and address issues related to how and under which circumstances data from PPI and COAs can be used to determine what constitutes a MCID in a patient-centred DHT-derived clinical-study endpoint from the patient perspective;</li><li>identify and address issues related to whether and how data from PPI, COAs, and patient-centred DHT-derived measures can be pooled, including the need for new techniques (including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large language models) to jointly analyse pooled data from the different types of measures;</li><li>address issues related to diversity in patient populations (e.g., disease type, disease stage, health literacy, cultural factors, etc.) on the use and results of PPI, COAs, and DHT-derived measures and the ethical and equity implications of patient diversity on the interpretation and utility of patient-centred measures of therapeutic benefit.</li></ul><p><strong>2. </strong>Develop recommendations for:</p><ul><li>using quantitative PPI to better understand COA data by demonstrating the relative importance of domains, items, and scores (and changes therein) within a COA instrument and relative to other commonly used endpoints (including endpoints included in relevant core outcomes sets) in clinical studies within the same therapeutic area;</li><li>understanding the relationships between COA data and patient-centred DHT-derived endpoints in diverse therapeutic areas;</li><li>using DHTs (e.g., apps, smart personal devices, smart drug-delivery devices, therapeutic medical technologies, etc.) to collect PPI and COA data;</li><li>using quantitative PPI, COAs, and patient-centred DHT-derived measures in combination to demonstrate the importance to patients of what is being measured by DHTs and determining what constitutes a MCID in a patient-centred, DHT-derived clinical-study endpoint.</li></ul><p><strong>3.</strong> Conduct at least four use cases to provide evidence to support the framework and recommendations.</p><p>Each use case should address one or more recommendations and all recommendations should be supported by one or more case studies.

Attention should be given also onto those cancers with a 5-year overall survival less than 50% from time of diagnosis and as well as to those relevant to paediatric cancers. It relies on scientific evidence and European, international or, where relevant, national guidelines.</li><li>The selection of the information provided to the users should be based on explicit and robust criteria and be transparent.</li><li>Provide a validated workflow for reviewing, selecting and timely updating the knowledge base when new clinical information and scientific evidence arise. The development and implementation of human centric AI-based tools may facilitate the reviewing, selecting and updating process.</li><li>An AI-based virtual assistant is implemented in the portal to interact with users and improve their experience by delivering information tailored to user cultural background, individual (clinical) circumstances, needs, preferences and/or expectations. This virtual assistant should be designed and tested in real-world patient populations for acceptability and value provided. Language should be non-technical and using lay terms.</li><li>All the developed IT-solutions and workflows should be open source and made available. The involvement of AI-researchers, clinicians, epidemiologists, guideline developers, service design specialists and patient organisation representatives are envisaged.</li><li>The pilot ECPDC information portal should also include other information that may be relevant to cancer patients and survivors and their families such as options to cross-border health care, participation to clinical research, psychosocial and legal support options, guidance and support for returning to study or to work, financial issues and survivors' rights.</li><li>To ensure an efficient and useful digital platform for patients, the pilot ECPDC information portal should be tested and validated by an appropriate number of cancer patients and survivors of different cancer types and age groups. Solutions to identified challenges should be provided and implemented. The action will also identify gaps in information relevant to patients and inform policy decisions.</li><li>A feasibility assessment of linking the pilot ECPDC information portal to the Knowledge Centre on Cancer, including operational solutions and sustainability, should be provided.</li><li>Regular monitoring, supervision and evaluation by KPIs should be conducted in order to ensure patient benefit.</li></ul><p>Due consideration should be given to initiatives such as: EU-CAYAS-NET; ERN PaedCan and other relevant EU initiatives. Successful applicants will be asked to liaise with these and other initiatives where applicable.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p><p>The Commission will facilitate coordination. Therefore, successful proposals will be asked to join the 'Quality of Life' cluster for the Mission on Cancer established in 2023 and should include a budget for networking, attendance at meetings, and potential joint activities without the prerequisite to give details of these at this stage. Examples: organising joint workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities with projects funded under other clusters and pillars of Horizon Europe, or other EU programmes, as appropriate.

This action provides a unique opportunity to cities in Member States and Associated Countries to take centre stage in implementing this vision. It allows them to bring together their citizens and R&amp;I communities to showcase the contribution of science in addressing the needs of citizens and its contribution to improving the wellbeing of citizens on a sustainable planet together with economic prosperity. The call topic invites a small group of cities to jointly design and implement a vibrant and engaging year-long programme of activities under the label 'Science comes to town 2026? with impact at local, regional and European level. The programme should connect local R&amp;I communities with a broad group of stakeholders and, most importantly, citizens around the topic of science and its role in society.</p><p><u>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes</u>:</p><ul><li>A year-long programme of diverse events and activities with a robust concept and brand, jointly developed and organised by a group of cities, promoting R&amp;I in Europe and fostering dialogue and exchange on science and its role in society.</li><li>Improved communication of science to the public through regular activities showcasing the latest developments and results in R&amp;I and their relevance to citizens and their lives, and through experimentation with innovative ways of connecting citizens and scientists, involving different age and social groups at local, regional and European level.</li><li>Enhanced discussion and debate on the future of science and R&amp;I policy in Europe, with emphasis on inclusive and participatory approaches, involving all relevant stakeholders within and outside the EU (e.g., researchers, research funders, policy-makers, publishers, citizens, civil society organisations).</li><li>Improved appeal of younger generations to careers in R&amp;I (in academia, industry or starting own business) through organising European-wide science competitions, including the European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) and the European Union Contest for early-career researchers (EU TalentOn), as well as other similar initiatives.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The new European Research Area (ERA) has the engagement of citizens, local communities and civil society at its core, seeking greater societal impact and increased trust in science. This action supports ERA Policy Agenda (2022-2024) action 14 - 'Bring science closer to citizens' through broad and inclusive engagement of all relevant stakeholders in a range of activities with a view to increasing the understanding, acceptance, uptake and impact of R&amp;I in society.</p><p>The action supports a consortium involving cities to host a coordinated joint 1-year programme with focus on connecting citizens and scientists in the participating cities and beyond, including the following:</p><ul><li>A year-long programme of various events and activities, such as lectures, workshops, exhibitions, competitions or prizes, in the spirit of the European Capital of Culture or the European Green Capital, that highlights the contribution of science to society and the results of R&amp;I projects supported by national/regional/EU funds, including the Horizon Europe programme.</li></ul><p>In addition, the programme of activities must include the following two components:</p><ul><li>EUCYS 2026, the European Union Contest for Young Scientists, an annual science competition for 14- to 20-year-olds that brings together first prize winners of national science contests for pre-Higher Education Institution school science projects to compete for prizes and awards. The contestants are judged by a jury of eminent scientists selected by the European Commission. The jury award 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> monetary prizes as well as other prestigious prizes donated to the contest by international research organisations and other similar bodies. The EU Contest takes place each year in a different location. The organisation of the contest is based on the General Guidelines on the organisation of the European Union Contest for Young Scientists and its Annex 1 - Rules of the contest. These are updated annually by the European Commission. The participating city that the proposal designates as host for EUCYS 2026 must provide as part of the proposal the commitment from its respective National EUCYS Organiser to run the 2026 competition as part of the project.</li><li>EU TalentOn 2026, the European Union Contest for Early Career Researchers, is a biennial science competition for 21- to 35-year-olds that brings together at least 100 early-career researchers to work on scientific solutions to societal challenges. The objective is to promote careers in research, facilitate cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration among early-career researchers, and to promote entrepreneurship and opportunities in academia and industry. The researchers are divided into small teams, which should be gender-balanced and be as much as possible geographically and socially inclusive, to compete for prizes and awards. The teams are mentored by experts from academia, industry and SMEs. Specific challenges are determined through a consultation with stakeholders in the field and are based on broader policy priorities.</li></ul><p>The programmed activities should target a wide population of European citizens with impact at local, regional and European level, and involve participants of different ages and across social groups and actors (students, researchers, citizens, policymakers, business and third sector organisations).</p><p>Proposals should develop and test the overall concept and brand of 'Science comes to town? with a view to future editions. Proposals are invited to experiment with new interactive and engaging formats across the programmed activities. In this context, special emphasis is placed on exploring and supporting citizen science as an important dimension of open science and as a way to promote science education and various forms of public engagement with science. The programme should take place in the participating cities, but proposers are encouraged to design and implement outreach activities that reach communities beyond the ones in the cities directly participating. Wherever possible, synergies should be sought with the European Researchers' Night, Europe's largest science communication and promotion event which brings together over 1,5 million visitors across Europe every year; as well as the Researchers at School initiative, both funded under the Marie Sk?odowska-Curie Actions.</p><p>The programme of activities must take place in at least 3 cities of 3 different Members States and/or Associated Countries, with the majority being in Member States. The consortium can comprise different types of legal entities that can represent the host cities and/or join them in designing and implementing the activities. Applicants must provide with their proposal commitment letters from the public authorities of the selected cities (city council or similar). The inclusion of local partners that provide the link to science, research and innovation is strongly encouraged.</p><p>Applicants must submit as part of their proposal the overall concept for the annual programme of activities, including the vision for content (focus and scope of activities), outreach strategy, and contribution to long-term vision for the cities. The concept has to distinguish between:</p><p>a) events, including EUCYS and TalentOn, that will be funded partially or fully by the Union contribution;</p><p>b) activities, such as the overall coordination and communication activities, that will be funded partially or fully by the Union contribution;</p><p>c) activities and events that will be financed by the participating cities; sponsorship and other resources (activities not funded by the Union contribution).</p><p>The consortium has to quantify in their proposal their commitment to mobilise substantial resources beyond the Union contribution. Monetary or in-kind sponsorships are encouraged to support and broaden the programmed activities, and further increase the impact of the action. Already established activities of the participating cities and other partners are encouraged to be included in the programme, but are excluded from funding under this action. The consortium has to report on the implementation of the activities and events not financed by the Union contribution, but not the related costs.</p><p>If participating cities wish to further expand the collaboration by engaging with other cities, e.g., with satellite events, they can consider to include them as partners without declaring costs in order to limit the administrative effort for them.</p><p>Priority activity for the successful applicants will be to co-design the detailed draft programme of activities. This will be a deliverable, due not later than 3 months before the formal launch of the 'Science comes to town 2026?, subject to the approval of the Granting Authority.</p><p>This action allows for the provision of financial support to third parties in the form of prizes to the total amount of:</p><ul><li>EU TalentOn: ?80,000</li><li>EUCYS: ?70 000</li></ul><p>The amount awarded to individuals must not exceed ?60 000.</p><p>The expected duration of the project is between 24 and 30 months.</p> <p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/eucys_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/eucys_en</a>.</p><p><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eu-talenton_en"">https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/eu-talenton_en</a>.</p><p>https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/msca-citizens</p>",,"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Horizon Europe has a new level of ambition - to maximise the impact of the European Union's research and innovation funding for European science, the economy and the wider society. It marks a paradigm change in the design of the European R&amp;I framework programmes (FP) from an activity-driven to an impact-driven programme. Coupled to this ambition is the relaunch of the European Research Area (ERA) as described in the Commission Communication 'A new ERA for Research and Innovation? (COM/2020/628 final of 30.09.2020).</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the importance of R&amp;I cooperation to provide solutions to society's most demanding needs. With the priority on delivering Europe's recovery as well as on the green and digital twin transitions, a new level of ambition, linking R&amp;I better with the economy, and with education and training, is needed to match these challenges and put scientific knowledge to work.</p><p>The new ERA calls for deepening existing priorities and creating new initiatives by strengthening the mobility of researchers and the free flow of knowledge and technology, to improve access to excellence, boost market uptake and prioritise investment and reform. Working together has been the philosophy of the ERA since its launch; however, the green and digital transitions and the COVID recovery call for more and closer cooperation between the Commission, the Member States and stakeholders. They require the setting of new priorities, launching ambitious joint initiatives and developing common approaches between policies.</p><p>To address these requirements, Destination 3 of part 11 of the Horizon Europe work programme will support efforts to reform and enhance the European R&amp;I system. Destination 3 is built around four strands corresponding to the four objectives set out in the ERA Communication:</p><ol> <li>Prioritising investments and reforms in research and innovation;</li><li>Improving access to excellence, progressing towards excellence across the whole EU and striving for stronger research and innovation systems;</li><li>Translating R&amp;I results into the economy to meet the digital and green transition objectives, and boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies;</li><li>Deepening the ERA, to further progress the free circulation of knowledge and to ensure an upgraded, efficient and effective R&amp;I system.</li></ol><p>The principle of excellence, meaning that the best researchers with the best ideas that offer the best solutions to the societal challenges obtain funding, remains the cornerstone for all investments under the ERA.</p><p><em>Strand 1</em> recognises the importance of prioritising investments and reforms to accelerate the green and digital transformation and to increase competitiveness as well as the speed and depth of the recovery. It offers support for policy-makers and addresses the need for better analysis and evidence, including simplifying and facilitating the inter-play between national and European R&amp;I systems.</p><p><em>Strand 2</em> addresses the need to improve access to excellence and to increase the performance of R&amp;I systems, building on dedicated Horizon Europe measures as well as complementarities with smart specialisation strategies under the Cohesion Policy.</p><p><em>Strand 3</em> focuses on the importance of translating R&amp;I results into the economy. R&amp;I policies should aim to boost the resilience and competitiveness of our economies and societies.</p><p><em>Strand 4</em> addresses the challenge of deepening the ERA and includes Open Science, Higher Education and Researchers, Citizen Science, Science Education, Gender and Ethics. It aims at underpinning a new ERA benefitting from knowledge creation, circulation and use. This empowers higher education institutions and research organisations to embrace a transformative process; where a highly skilled workforce can circulate freely; and where research outputs are shared; where gender equality is assured; where the outcomes of R&amp;I are understood, trusted and increasingly used, by educated informed scientists and citizens to the benefit of society.</p><p><strong>Expected impact: </strong></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impacts, focussing on those that are most relevant to the respective topic:</p><ol> <li>Reform and enhance of the European R&amp;I system;</li><li>Prioritisation of investments and reforms, accomplish the recovery and the twin transitions;</li><li>Improved access to excellence;</li><li>High quality scientific production and stronger translation of R&amp;I results into the economy;</li><li>Deepen the ERA;</li><li>Coordinated national and regional R&amp;I programmes by pooling national resources and contributing to the alignment of national research and innovation policies;</li><li>Improved knowledge for policy making about the networking patterns of research support staff and research management;</li><li>Synergies between research &amp; innovation and higher education policies and programmes;</li><li>Modernised higher education sector, adressing higher education, research, and innovation;</li><li>Increased number of interconnected knowledge ecosystems, strong in knowledge creation, circulation and use;</li><li>Researchers benefitting from attractive careers;</li><li>Inclusive gender equality is promoted in the European research and innovation system;</li><li>A more open and inclusive research and innovation system;</li><li>Increased capacity in the EU R&amp;I system to conduct open science and to set it as a <em>modus operandi</em> of modern science;</li><li>Increased engagement of citizens with research and innovation;</li><li>Increased alignment of strategic research with societal needs, expectations and values;</li><li>Identify synergies between second and third level education, and between education and business;</li><li>Increased trust in science and R&amp;I outcomes, and greater two-way communication between science and society;</li><li>Knowledge and a highly skilled workforce circulate freely;</li><li>Improved capacities within the EU R&amp;I system to conduct open science.</li></ol>",,,

Gains from major breakthroughs in key capacity digital technological areas (e.g. artificial intelligence, data analytics, virtual worlds, photonics, quantum, cloud and edge computing, and others) cannot materialise if there are not enough people with adequate knowledge to develop, deploy and use those digital technologies and their related applications. Evidence from the Structured Dialogue on digital education and skills with Member States shows that a majority of Member States expressed concerns about the shortage of ICT specialists<sup>1</sup>. Even in Member States that are digital frontrunners, there is a persistent shortage of people able to develop and deploy key digital technologies<sup>2</sup>. There also is a significant increase in the demand for professionals combining sectoral knowledge with digital skills enabling the use of digital solutions for specific business cases. This is for example the case of employees in the manufacturing sector able to use augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) tools to repair engines remotely, software developers and engineers with specific automotive expertise, or professionals in industrial sectors that are key to the green transition who are increasingly relying on advanced digital technologies in the development of renewable energy or clean and smart mobility solutions. These profiles can be referred to as users of advanced digital technologies and they are crucial to enable and support the digitalisation of traditional industrial sectors from agriculture and finance to manufacturing, automotive and medicine, and are key to achieve the twin green and digital transition.</p><p>Looking at the related education offer, the 2022 JRC report shows that the offer of specialised education programme in AI, cybersecurity, HPC and data science has slightly improved in the EU 27, in particular in AI, where the number of Master programmes has increased by 20% compared to the previous year. However, it remains lower than in the United States. For cybersecurity the United Kingdom alone continue to offer as many programmes as all EU Member States together<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The actions in the skills pillar therefore aim at tackling this challenge, while triggering a new way of delivering these programmes, building partnerships between academia, businesses and research across the EU.</p><p><sup>1 </sup><em>SWD (2023) 205 final: COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT accompanying the documents: Proposal for a Council Recommendation on the key enabling factors for successful digital education and training and Proposal for a Council Recommendation on improving the provision of digital skills in education and training {COM(2023) 205 final}</em></p><p><sup>2 </sup><em>For example, over 70% of enterprises looking for ICT specialists in the Netherlands, Finland and Luxembourg found it extremely difficult to recruit ICT specialists.

The call of 2023 built on the experience of the first work programme<sup>5</sup>, addressing the latest initiatives to support the development and deployment of key digital skills and capacities in digital technology areas, such as AI, data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, as well as other inter-, trans- or multi-disciplinary areas, and their applications in strategic sectors. The call of 2024 will support the development and deployment of key digital skills in selected digital areas: virtual worlds, edge computing, quantum computing, photonics, and robotics and automatization. The call will also support interdisciplinary programmes that will target the acquisition of advanced green digital skills (e.g. in the area of AI, data analytics, virtual/augmented reality, robotics, cloud computing, Internet of Things, machine learning, etc.) in selected strategic sectors: agriculture, transport, renewable energy, waste management, as well as the acquisition of advanced digital skills for government and public sector. In the selected digital areas and strategic sectors there is a high demand for ICT specialists (and is expected to further grow), but at the same time the offer of education programmes for these areas/sectors is limited, what will hinder their potential for economic uptake and growth. The call should also support possible cooperation in the context of ongoing international cooperation related to digital topics (e.g. digital partnerships, trade and technology councils, policy dialogues, Talent Growth Task Force), e.g. by supporting students from those countries with financial support (e.g. via scholarships, fee waivers, or others) to participate in the education programmes including promoting female students participation. The proposals should clearly identify one digital area or one strategic sector as the main focus of their work and the challenges addressed. It is expected to fund at least the highest-ranking proposal from each above listed digital area or strategic sector providing that all thresholds are attain and within the limits of the budget available for this topic.</p><p>Projects financed under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and complementarities with actions on technology deployment supported by other pillars of the programme as well as links and synergies with programmes and initiatives like Erasmus+, European Universities Alliances, Erasmus+ Alliances for Innovation, European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs), the EIT Campus, the Deep Tech Talent Initiative and its possible follow-up initiatives, as well as the Large Scale Partnerships under the Pact for Skills.</p><p>The primary objective of this topic is to support the design and deliver a higher degree education programme(s) (at ISCED levels 6 (Bachelor's or equivalent level), 7 (Master's or equivalent level) or equivalent in 2023 and at ISCED levels 6, 7, 8 (doctoral or equivalent level) in 2024 - hereafter education programmes and to develop related self-standing modules, in selected key digital areas and for the acquisition of advanced digital skills in specific strategic sectors. Besides the design and delivery of new educational programmes and self-standing modules, the selected projects can cover activities to attract qualified teaching staff, scholarships for students, the purchase or leasing costs for equipment, and different activities to establish partnership between academia, industry and research centers. The selected projects will also bring a clear EU added-value to the proposed education activities (such as cross-border collaborations, networks and exchange of ideas).</p><p><sup>4 </sup><em>Previous calls prioritised key digital areas were: Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, Cloud computing, Cybersecurity, Data, Extended reality, Internet of Things, Microelectronics, Photonics, Quantum, Robotics.</em></p><p><sup>5 </sup><em>List of selected projects from previous DIGITAL programme calls are and will be available on the Funding and Tenders portal (i.e. DIGITAL-2021-SKILLS-01-SPECIALISED and DIGITAL-2022-SKILLS-03-SPECIALISED-EDU).</em></p> <span>Expected Impact</span>:<p>Deliverables:</p><ul><li>Consortia of higher education institutions, research organisations and businesses and other stakeholders design and deliver education programmes and self-standing modules in the area of advanced digital skills for developers and users of advanced digital technologies.</li><li>Higher education institutions are upgraded with digital solutions, equipment and infrastructure, with a special focus on interoperability of IT systems.</li><li>Students are supported with scholarships (for participating in education programmes and internships), or via other financial and support measures.</li><li>Structural and sustainable partnerships between members of the consortium are established.</li></ul>",,,,,

(see 2.3.2), the main objective of this action is to consolidate existing results and move towards an ecosystem of mature and networked LDTs across the EU to help cities and communities achieve economies of scale when developing their data platform and LDT services.</p><p>EU cities and communities are evolving towards digital communities at a different pace and this topic is proposing three complementary activities to help them achieve economies of scale when adopting data, LDT and AI-based solutions. Previous WP supported the creation of an EU data space for smart communities (and its validation via pilots) and action 2.3.2 pioneers innovative services using 'Citiverse' technology. Under the WP 2021-22, the Commission has also launched procurement actions to support the development of a LDT toolbox in the EU. However, more effort is needed to create a pan-European ecosystem of digital twins that can connect and scale up towards a future 'EU CitiVerse?. To achieve the approach is to support the development of open source LDT solutions based on common needs of EU cities and communities (both urban and rural), to connect them and to enrich them with additional innovative services. In order to address the different maturity level of cities and communities, this action will help (1) connect and further develop the already existing LDTs, (2) gain a critical mass of smart communities' data sets, as well as (3) deploy, test, and add more complex AI-based elements to the LDT toolbox, addressing the needs of digitally advanced smart communities.</p><p>These and future actions regarding LDTs are contributing to the effective implementation of a Multi Country Project (MCP) in the area of Connected Public Administration.</p><p>The action is divided in three objectives, each to be achieved through a separate work strand:</p><ul><li>Objective 1: <strong>Technical inter-connection of existing LDTs:</strong> Connecting data platforms and LDTs from cities and communities that already have a LDT in place, in order to create an EU 'federation? of LDTs. Reinforced interoperability through the aggregation of LDTs at a larger scale (cross sectors, cross cities, and cross borders) will help to scale up the EU common data sets and open-source solutions. It will also facilitate the way for less advanced cities and communities who wish to join the existing EU LDT ecosystem.</li><li>Objective 2: <strong>Creation of LDTs based on common needs:</strong> Developing open-source pilots of LDTs services, based on shared needs of cities and communities that already have a local data platform and/or a LDT and want to expand them with new real-life use case services. These services should aim to improve decision-making processes and citizen interaction; reduce risks, costs and downtime; enhance resilience and sustainability of LDT platforms and enable new value creation.</li><li>Objective 3: <strong>Adding new complex AI-based tools to the LDTs toolbox</strong>: Complementing the EU LDT toolbox launched under WP2021-22 with additional complex AI-based and innovative services (e.g., for adaptable multi-sector considerations, advanced simulation and modelling approaches including bottom-up self-organised models). The AI services should be developed and tested within existing cities/communities and be transferable to other contexts.</li></ul><p>These objectives will be implemented through three work strands by a single project that will provide cascading funding to the third parties through a single call.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The selected proposal will manage a community of projects selected by cascading funding mechanism. The work of these projects will be implemented through three main work strands:</p><ul><li>Work strand 1: Connect existing LDTs at EU level and lay down the foundations of an EU LDT ecosystem. When connecting LDTs, and their related data sets, projects should align with the smart cloud-to-edge middleware platform Simpl to achieve interoperability and make use of horizontal services available under the Digital Europe programme such as the Smart Communities dataspace blueprint, the EU data cloud infrastructure and the EU LDT toolbox.</li><li>Work strand 2: Launch new pilot LDT services based on common needs of cities and communities to enhance interoperability and collaboration. The services should be tested in real-life conditions and expand the EU LDT ecosystem by making use of and contributing to the development of the EU LDT toolbox catalogue. The pilots should include at least the following activities:</li></ul><ol> <li>designing real life use cases based on open and interoperable data sets across sectors. The use of these data sets should follow requirements of the data space for smart cities and communities' blueprint;</li><li>building and deploying the pilot services on LDT platforms at city/community level with real use case data;</li><li>defining roadmaps for making available the LDT-based services on the EU LDT toolbox catalogue</li></ol><ul><li>Work strand 3: Add new complex AI-based components to the forthcoming EU LDT toolbox to address the needs of cities/communities:</li></ul><ol> <li>Develop and deliver new AI-based services to create simulations, predictive models and forecast in a variety of sectors and use cases amongst which the New European Bauhaus, public services and communities' resilience;</li><li>Develop and deliver solutions for designing, optimising, and testing urban policies in dynamic complex environments with several interwoven sectors (e.g., traffic volume and pollution levels). AI classical optimization may be complemented with self-organised bottom-up solutions that will offer the necessary adaptability and robustness;</li><li>Develop and deliver new complex AI-based services related to citizen's engagement, with or without the use of eXtended Reality technology to address aspects of the New European Bauhaus initiative and implement a sustainable, democratic and citizen-centric CitiVerse.</li></ol><p>To maximize the scale-up and reusability of the new services, these should be designed in such a way that they can be adopted by different maturity levels LDT architectures.</p>",,,,,

Projected climate change, an ageing society and persisting socio-economic inequalities mean that differences in vulnerability and exposure to climate change are likely to continue. In addition, adaptation responses may worsen existing inequalities or even create new ones.</p><p>Vulnerable and marginalised groups are particularly exposed to the impacts of climate change, especially high temperature and flooding. Moreover, nearly half of city hospitals and schools are in areas with strong urban heat island effects, thus exposing their vulnerable users to high temperatures. With approximately 10% of schools and 11% of hospitals across Europe located in potential flood-prone areas, the areas at higher risk of floods tend to have higher proportions of disadvantaged people than areas at lower risk of floods.</p><p>The climate adaptation measures in place do not benefit everyone in society to the same extent. For example, the most vulnerable groups tend to have lower access to green spaces and are least able to pay for flood insurance or flood-proofing measures.</p><p>Proposals should identify, develop, test and demonstrate equitable adaptation actions and solutions, increasing adaptive capacity, reducing vulnerability and risks and addressing specific climate vulnerabilities identified as relevant at regional and local scale, taking into account place-based climate data, socio-economic information, and local governance.</p><p>Proposals should specifically address how the most vulnerable groups in relation to their age, gender, health, socio-economic status or other social vulnerability characteristic would be catered for. This should include how these groups are identified; how they are meaningfully included in the development of the adaptation actions (process); and in what ways they are expected to benefit from these actions (outcome).</p><p>Regional and/or local authorities should be directly involved in the development of equity-oriented policies and measures so as to assure their up-take during the course of the project and their continuous application beyond the end of the project. As a limited capacity and availability for engagement of the target groups might prevent them from directly participating in the consortium, the proposal should include specific considerations on how to ensure that insights from the target group are reflected in the project; how solutions can be co-designed with the target group; and on how the outcomes and results can be used on the ground. Proposals should also leverage the methodologies and approaches toolbox for citizens engagement made available by other projects [in particular CLIMAS and AGORA funded by the Horizon Europe Mission Work Programme], and initiatives [such as the JRC Competence Centre on Participatory and Deliberative Democracy], and by the Missions Implementation Platform.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions / local communities, the proposals should already identify other regions/local communities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating? regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating? regions. Replicating regions are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities in the course of the project but they should at least prepare in the course of the project the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.</p><p>Proposals should build (when relevant) upon existing knowledge and lessons learnt on questions of climate justice, vulnerability and inequality including from other regions in the world. Similarly, they should build on adaptation solutions designed and previously developed from previous projects addressing climate change adaptation, funded by EU and National programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe under their different pillars and clusters), as well as the LIFE programme and also beyond EU. Synergies with other funding sources (EU and national) should be sought, in order to support common approach towards climate adaptation, sustainability, transfer of knowledge and innovative solution and including to identify opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across Europe through other programmes such as the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, the European Regional Development Funds or the Just Transition Fund. Regions with Territorial Just Transition Plans are encouraged to participate in this call to strengthen their climate adaptation capacity, secure the sustainability of regional investments and avoid maladaptation.?</p><p>Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with Mission Implementation Platform and Climate-ADAPT.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will get direct access to participate in the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities. To this extent, proposals should provide for dedicated activities and earmark appropriate resources. In addition, projects will be requested to feed results and contribution to progress towards the objectives of the Mission to the Mission Implementation Platform, as the central Mission action for monitoring, support and visualisation of the Mission progress in Regions in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Regions participating in the projects will also be required to feed their results to the Climate-ADAPT and EEA assessments.

It also confirmed its objectives and the strength of its approach.</p><p><strong>A regional approach</strong></p><p>The Mission wants to mobilise all actors, such as countries, regional and local authorities, research institutes, industry, investors and citizens to create real and lasting <strong>impact</strong> and to accelerate their transformation to become <strong>climate resilient. </strong>By signing the Mission Charter, more than 300 regions, cities and local authorities have committed to working together to transition faster to a climate resilient Europe.</p><p>In line with the Horizon Europe legal basis, all the actions supported by this Work Programme are open to actors from EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, and in particular, regions and local authorities. However, regions and local authorities already engaged in the Mission activities (e.g. Charter Signatories, Community of Practice) have already proven their commitment and motivation to work towards the objectives of the mission and, as such, they provide an ideal test-bed where the testing and demonstration of innovative approaches could take place.</p><p>As confirmed by the survey of regions and local authorities who adhered to the Mission Charter, some regions, cities and local authorities in Europe are well prepared to climate change, others are striving for solutions to address their vulnerabilities. The Mission aims to support as priority less developed regions and local authorities that are more vulnerable to climate impacts and have low adaptive capacity. The mission fosters, -- by the mean of the Mission Implementation Platform and its Community of Practice - the sharing of experiences and lessons learnt from others, accompanying regions and local authorities in finding and possibly reapplying solutions adapted to their climatic situation and socio-economic context.</p><p>The R&amp;I support will be provided in different ways:</p><p>1. Provide general support to European regions, local authorities and communities to better understand, prepare for and manage climate risks and opportunities</p><p>2. Accelerate transformations to climate resilience: cooperate with at least 150 regions, local authorities and communities to accelerate their transformation to a climate resilient future, supporting them in the co-creation of innovation pathways and the testing of solutions</p><p>3. Demonstrate systemic transformations to climate resilience: deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities.</p><p>For 2023, the Mission will focus on supporting regions, local authorities and communities in demonstrating, at real scale and in real life, climate resilience solutions that address one or more of the systems locally identified as key to build climate resilience, and as the most vulnerable to effects of climate change. Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

Effectively adapting to climate change relies on cross-sectoral approaches, looking at the system as a whole, and on the inclusion of a variety of actors.</p><p>Proposals should integrate multi-faceted technological, digital, business, governance and environmental aspects with social innovation into the development of solutions contributing to increase preparedness to changing climate for specific regions, cities or local communities. For example, they should assess and identify management solutions that best minimise and compensate the loss of ecosystem services (e.g., water cycling and cooling that were previously provided by soil and trees) while improving climate preparedness. The proposed solution should address climate risk identified as relevant at regional and local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account place-based data, socio-economic, identity characteristics, local governance and the regional sustainable and smart specialization strategies when available.</p><p>In its approach, the proposed solution should go 'far beyond addressing a specific sector', taking into account and addressing wide-ranging impacts. It should take a systemic approach, looking at the interconnections and interdependencies between them. For example, proposals could explore solutions addressing the interlinkages between climate, water, food, soil, biodiversity loss and others, which form a nexus where resource use and availability rely heavily on one another. Considering the current increasing trend of water scarcity (periods of drought followed by storms and floods, with a decreasing overall annual precipitations) tackling the pollution problem linked to these extreme climate events would be relevant. Another example of systemic approach can relate to the integration of multilevel planning, which integrates spatial and urban planning with the design of different services such as transport, mobility, energy, connectivity in a city. Interesting examples in this sense may come for instance from the New European Bauhaus initiative, which intends to accelerate the green transition by combining sustainability with inclusion and aesthetics/quality of experience.</p><p>Interconnections and interdependencies need to be well understood and are further complicated as amplitude of climate change in the future is uncertain. In the medium and long term, for example, we know that climate change will affect water availability and crop yields with wide-ranging implications and that certain adaptation options (such as broader use of desalination for provision of drinking water to cope with water scarcity) can be energy intensive which compounds the problem of global warming, have local impacts on coastal and marine ecosystems, have side-effects that impact the environment (as is the case of brine from desalination, or water abstractions to produce hydrogen). Furthermore, it is not known to which level those adaption options could be implemented locally based on the relevance of the expected impacts or would be bashed away.</p><p>Proposals should look to how tackle and possibly minimise trade-offs, maximise co-benefits and leverage opportunities a systemic approach offers to address the challenges of a changing climate in the specific local context. In doing this, they should produce state-of-the-art- analysis in a multidisciplinary approach addressing the science-policy nexus; they should go beyond theoretical research and/or theoretical discussions or the pure understanding and quantifying of the links between the different elements and sectors. On the contrary, proposals should turn them into operational and practical insights and tangible solutions experimented on the regional and local grounds, clearly addressing trade-offs and co-benefits, with a view of achieving optimum outcomes. Proposals should also consider how to turn the proposed solutions into new standards so to allow faster uptake at scale.</p><p>In addition, proposals should mobilise and include all value chain actors and pay careful attention to matching innovators and solutions providers with end-users/regions interested in testing and further developing the proposed solutions on the ground; they should also foster the development of business models that can support the sustainability of the proposed solutions.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the required demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities, where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable as sharing common climate change challenges.

Indeed, the Mission will support the innovation still needed to implement the solutions at scale, in the specific environment where the demonstration will take place, and to transform the key systems into a more climate resilient systems, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority.</p><p>For both years, the support will boost and complement the supporting structures already in place for the Mission, to foster the multi-level governance across national, regional and local level and to facilitate exchanges and replication between the different actors. The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

Most promising climate adaptation projects rely on grants and public investments for their development. In many cases, while they benefit the public good, they struggle to prove any profitability and they risk getting abandoned at the end of the project when the initial financing comes to an end.</p><p>The European Investment Bank has shown that climate projects succeeding in securing investments are very rarely only addressing adaptation to climate change and in most of the cases they rather add a climate proofing component to a bigger project (for example, over dimensioning of an urban sewage system to take into account future scenarios of extreme rainfall events). The integration of climate change adaptation and mitigation theoretically provides co-benefits: efficiencies in the project implementation can provide capital savings (e.g., realising a green space for a city provides also water storage capacity in addition to a recreational opportunity); the mitigation component of the project can provide measurable outcomes in shorter timelines, reducing the scientific uncertainty of future climate scenarios. Furthermore, implementation can be faster as benefits can be faster monetized, and social acceptance facilitated.</p><p><strong>Proposals should identify financially valuable cases of climate projects including climate adaptation dimension on top of other benefits</strong>, while safeguarding the principle of do-not significantly harm any environment objective (such as, biodiversity and ecosystems, freshwater etc). They should develop and test solutions, based on technological, social and / or business innovation, that deliver at once an increase of the resilience and adaptation capacity to climate change in the involved regions, cities, local authorities and communities, while also contributing to reduce or neutralise carbon emissions, improve water efficiency and/or safeguard biodiversity. To prove the financial viability of the proposed solutions, proposals should include business and/or investor partners and/or private sector actors (for example from the financial and / or insurance sector) in the consortium, interested in investing in the project (by participating directly in the consortium) as more resilient / less risky / more sustainable and assuring that they will maintaining the solutions in place beyond the duration of the project.</p><p>The proposed solution should address specific climate vulnerabilities identified as relevant at regional and local scale, with tailor-made responses and measures taking into account place-based data, socio-economic, identity characteristics and local governance.</p><p>Under the Mission approach, collaborations to develop and test effective solutions between regions/local authorities/communities facing similar challenges are highly encouraged and considered as a means to secure a larger impact. To this purpose, while the demonstration is expected to take place in at least three regions, the proposals should already identify other regions/local authorities/ communities (sharing common climate challenges), where reapplication of the proposed approach will be suitable. Inclusion already in the proposal of at least three 'replicating? regions/local authorities/communities, interested in reapplying the lessons learnt (totally, partially or with the required adjustments) in their territories is required; this could take the form of inclusion in the consortium of one or more partners providing support for the technical exchanges and the knowledge uptake in the 'replicating? regions. Replicating regions are not expected to also conduct a demonstration or carry out on the ground activities already in the course of the project but they should at least prepare, the theoretical framework for implementing the replication through the lessons exchanged with the demonstration regions.</p><p>Proposals should build (when relevant) upon previous developed or existing knowledge and adaptation solutions, designed and developed from previous projects. Those previous projects and initiatives that address climate change adaptation can be funded by National programmes; EU programmes, in particular the European Union Framework programmes for Research and Innovation (such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe), as well as the LIFE and Cohesion programmes but can also come from beyond the EU. Moreover, proposals should look into opportunities to scale up the solutions demonstrated and to foster their broad deployment across the European Union through the LIFE programme, and its integrated projects in particular, and through the European Regional Development Fund programmes. Projects should also connect to the work of the Climate Resilience Dialogue and link to the EU's sustainable finance agenda and taxonomy work and the use of sustainable investment ratings, when relevant.</p><p>Proposals should include a mechanism and the resources to establish operational links and collaboration with the Mission Implementation Platform and the Climate-ADAPT platform and should also link with projects awarded under the topic HORIZON-MISS-2022-CLIMA-01-02 on 'Unlocking of financial resources for investments into climate resilience?.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic will get direct access to participate in the Mission Community of Practice and to the networking activities supported by the Mission Implementation Platform. These networking and joint activities could, for example, involve the participation in joint workshops, the exchange of knowledge, the development and adoption of best practices, or joint communication activities.

The support will address the improvement of indicators to measure progress of regions and local authorities in their efforts of becoming better prepared and will also address the complexity of cascading and compounding effects of climate change as those can diminish the effectiveness of the measures undertaken. In line with the overall objective of the Mission to support regional and local authorities to accelerate their transformation, support will be oriented towards regions, local authorities and communities demonstrating at real scale and in real life climate resilience solutions, with Nature-Based Solutions to be explored as priority. The demonstration projects would ideally be part of the adaptation roadmaps developed to address the climate risks identified at the local scale and will contribute to the implementation of the National Adaptation Plans and regional adaptation pathway/strategy, where available. In the spirit of the Mission, those projects should also be co-designed, co-developed and co-implemented with the engagement and support of the local stakeholders, such as citizens, businesses and /or social partners.</p><p>Engagement and commitment by the Regions and the local authorities directly in the demonstration activities will ensure the solutions are kept in place after the end of projects. This will contribute to the aim to deliver at least 75 large-scale demonstrations of systemic transformations to climate resilience across European regions, local authorities and communities by 2030, scaling up and fostering large-scale deployment of tested innovative solutions for climate resilience, the enabling of their diffusion and the removal of barriers for their uptake.</p>",,,,

Sustainably managing common-pool resources and the provision of public goods (here taken together 'the Commons') are an important dimension in the EU Missions. Unlike technology development or scientific progress, for societal transitions and missions that relate to environmental and social Commons, scholars consider small-scale multistakeholder activities within a local or regional innovation ecosystem to be crucial for the non-technological innovation processes.</p><p>Such innovation ecosystems for transformative change include non-commercial stakeholders like civil society and administrations.</p><p>Such intensive transdisciplinary interactions are required, for example, for effective spatial planning and community action for increasing resilience to climate change, or for better services of prevention, early detection and care for cancer in vulnerable groups of society. To be effective such transdisciplinary research and innovation actions need a strong scientific lead in its design and operations in order to draw scientifically sound conclusions. The experience gathered and conclusions drawn must be taken up locally to create impact, for example in training courses, in by-laws for land management or in targeted support to entrepreneurship. The topic acknowledges the potential of local and regional collaborative, transdisciplinary action in research and innovation for the EU Missions and the value of sharing of data, innovative approaches, and experience in designing and managing local transdisciplinary research and innovation actions with other regions engaging in the Missions.</p><p>Higher education institutions, universities and research institutes are key players for these actions. They already provide diverse services to stakeholders in their local region, including: lifelong learning courses and applied research that take account of the specific needs and opportunities of businesses and industries; research activities in the social sciences and humanities investigate cultural preferences; start-up ecosystems build around them, complemented by citizens' science; and science outreach activities engage citizens of all ages. At the same time, students and researchers participate in international networks and transfer knowledge to and from the region.</p><p>For these reasons, universities, other higher education institutions and research institutes receive recognition and trust from public administration and public services, civil society, education, the private sector and other diverse stakeholders in their home region for their role as impartial, competent and knowledge-based actors for the co-creation of fair and inclusive innovation processes. This puts them in a good position to undertake collaborative, transdisciplinary research and innovation activities in their local context and enables them to play multiple, important roles in the realisation of the objectives of the Green Deal and the EU Missions.</p><p>Proposals should therefore support transdisciplinary research and innovation activities by one or more higher education institution(s), university(-ies) or research institute(s) together with regional stakeholders in support of the objectives of one of the EU Missions.</p><p>The proposal should aim to implement, for the benefit of a specific location or region in an EU Member States or countries associated to Horizon Europe, a research and innovation action that:</p><ol> <li>concretely contributes to the achievement of the objectives of one of the EU Missions, by creating new knowledge and/or developing and testing innovative approaches in co-creation with regional stakeholders, while not replicating the scientific/technological approach of projects already funded by Horizon Europe in support of the EU Missions<sup></sup>Projects funded by Horizon Europe in support of the five EU Missions are documented either on the Missions' platforms and/or on Cordis (<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://cordis.europa.eu"">https://cordis.europa.eu</a>), the platform for EU research results, using the search via 'Call ID? search string *MISS*. <strong><u>and</u></strong></li><li>engages in concrete transdisciplinary research and innovation activities <strong><u>and</u></strong> in strategy development to bring the Mission to the regional or local level stakeholders that traditionally have more difficulties accessing European level research and innovation support and/or the EU Missions (notably: small and medium sized enterprises; communal, municipal or other public services; citizens, civil society or philanthropy).</li></ol><p>The action provides the opportunity to integrate as partners in the project non-local entities that contribute to the project with special knowledge or capacities otherwise absent in the region. To increase the European added value, projects have to foresee activities active engagement in the learning environments created by the relevant Mission platforms. This should be reflected in the projects' communication and dissemination activities and is considered an integral part of the expected impact of the project.</p><p>Activities should aim to have tangible local or regional impact for one of the EU Missions, arising from the full integration of different academic disciplines in interaction with local stakeholders in the activities on the ground, for example in moderated or supervised experimentation and citizens' science activities in communities, in living labs or in regulatory testbeds.</p><p>Insights created from these experimental activities should be taken up locally by stakeholders, for example in teaching and training activities, or in specific funding schemes for deployment and replication of innovations implemented by philanthropic funders, or commercial or development banks. Methods and results of the projects should be propagated in the wider Mission context to academic and non-academic stakeholders.</p><p>Financial support to third parties may be provided, for example to cover the costs of experimental actions conducted by civil organisations or neighbourhoods, or for a local start-up support centre to provide seed funding for an innovative commercial activity that directly supports the objectives of the Mission.

In short, social innovations are 'innovations that are social in ends and means.? They materialize as new products, services, and models that simultaneously meet social needs more effectively than alternatives and create new social relationships or collaborations. Social innovation involves not only citizens, but also public authorities, business and industry, and academia in the design, development, and execution of innovations. Social innovation is not only good for society, but also enhances society's capacity to act. Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, results in a greater sense of agency and greater buy-in by citizens, industrialists, and public authorities, democratic participation, enhances the resilience of communities, increases the relevance, acceptance, and uptake of innovation, and helps foster lasting changes in individual behaviours, social practices, as well as governance models. In short, social innovation acts as a system changer.</p><p>As such, social innovation processes are relevant to all EU Missions. The Commission expects social innovation to mobilise additional stakeholders and stakeholder communities such as philanthropic funders at European level for the benefit of the EU Missions.</p><p>The availability of philanthropic and other funding for social innovation is highly skewed within EU Member States and Countries associated to Horizon Europe and philanthropic and charitable funders face particular challenges to invest 'cross-border'. The EU wants to contribute to establishing a better funding environment for social innovation in the context of missions across the EU and associated countries by enhancing the networking and experience sharing of funders (notably by the action described in topic HORIZON-MISS-2024-CROSS-01-01) and aims at collaborating to that end with interested funders by establishing long-term partnerships (framework partnership agreement / FPA).</p><p>Article 130(2) of EU Financial regulation provides: 'The purpose of a financial framework partnership agreement shall be to facilitate the achievement of policy objectives of the Union by stabilising the contractual terms of the cooperation.

In a nutshell, social innovations are 'innovations that are social in ends and means.? They materialize as new products, services, and models that simultaneously meet social needs more effectively than alternatives and create new social relationships or collaborations. Social innovation involves not only citizens, but also public authorities, business and industry, as well as academia in the design, development, and execution of innovations. It connects society and innovation. Social innovation is not only good for society, but also enhances society's capacity to act. Social innovation engages and empowers citizens, results in a greater sense of agency, i.e. their ability to take action or to choose what action to take, and greater buy-in by citizens, industrialists, and public authorities, elicits active, democratic participation, enhances the resilience of communities, increases the relevance, acceptance, and uptake of innovation, and helps foster lasting changes in individual behaviours, social practices, and governance models. In short, social innovation acts as a system changer.</p><p>As such, social innovation processes are relevant to all EU Missions mobilising additional stakeholders and stakeholder communities (like philanthropic funders and for- and with-impact investors) for the benefit of the Missions.</p><p>Applicants are also encouraged to build on relevant ongoing activities undertaken by the EU Missions such as Mission Platforms.</p><p>To help EU Missions achieve their objectives, the action should undertake the following activities:</p><ol> <li>create and animate a network of entities interested in scaling up social innovations to advance the EU Missions as well as entities interested in investing in social innovation ventures, for the purpose of raising awareness and facilitating information exchange;</li><li>create a favourable environment to upscale social innovation with the financial support of beneficiaries like entities interested in investing in such social innovation ventures;</li><li>offer advisory services and mentoring for 'social innovators' wishing to expand the geographic scope of their activities within the EU and countries associated to Horizon Europe or interested in taking up social innovation from abroad. Advisory and mentoring may go as far assisting the preparation of upscaling plans and investment proposals, and matchmaking with social innovation funders.</li></ol><p>Applicants should propose convincing cooperation models with the relevant Commission services such as the EU Mission Secretariats to ensure that the project contributes to the objectives of the EU Missions.

Labour intensive manual planning is infeasible within the constraints of available time and resources. The general objective is to develop advanced automated support tools for the generation and evaluation of courses of action (COAs) in an MDO context. The toolset is expected to support wargaming of the candidate COAs to ensure that commanders and staff can assess the plan and options in detail before final decision making.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This call aims to explore technologies, concepts, products, processes and services towards a common simulation framework for wargames/combat simulations with the potential to facilitate reinforcement learning for mission planning and execution support.</p><p>Re-planning and decision-making during mission execution are likely to be challenged in the interconnected, manned-unmanned, automated and high-speed battlespace. In the future, the clear distinction between mission planning and execution is expected to be challenged by exploiting battlespace information and predictive capabilities. Proper support is needed to speed up the OODA-loop to outpace the adversary in the planning phase as well as in the execution phase.</p><p>The development and use of a computer-based decision support system that leverages AI, machine learning, wargames/combat simulations and digital twins of the battlespace has the potential to change the military planning and decision-making concept of operations (CONOPS).</p><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown a huge potential for solving planning problems in civilian applications. However, despite its headline success in video games, strategy games and other planning domains over the last few years, RL is not making similar progresses in the realm of wargames/combat simulations for military operations planning. Videogames leave a lot of margin when it comes to critical (life or death) simulation. Nevertheless, if access to classified data from the field is not possible, videogames data may be used for a proof of concept.<em></em></p><p>Simulation frameworks tailored to particular domains have played a major role in facilitating reinforcement learning in those domains, as witnessed by the impact of e.g., OpenAI Gym and the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).</p><p>A common simulation framework for wargames/combat simulations has the potential of similarly facilitating reinforcement learning-support in mission planning and execution.</p><p>As it is related to EUDIS, this topic aims to support, in addition to the research activities, the creation of an innovation test hub in the field of simulation and training. To achieve this objective, financial support to third parties (cascade funding) (FSTP) is included as part of the grant. This should increase the opportunities for various smaller actors, including those not previously active in the defence sector, to adapt innovative simulation technologies for defence applications and to identify potential business opportunities in the defence sector.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address studies and design of a reinforcement learning environment/testbed or framework for training of AI agents to develop courses of actions in mission planning, including a flexible and open combat simulation framework fit for RL. It must address the need for rapid and user-friendly creation of scenarios, considering commander's objectives and intent, rules of engagement and other mission constraints (e.g., speed, resources, attrition). It must also include studies and design of a combat simulation system (not necessarily the same used for AI agent training) including trained AI agents to support mission planning. For the support to mission execution the scope includes studies and design of a digital twin of the ongoing mission for prediction and decision-making support. The proposal must establish a proof-of-concept demonstrator for verification, validation and demonstration.</p><p>The learning environment, including the combat simulation framework must be flexible and adaptive for different scenarios and domains. It must take advantage of open standards and open-source frameworks both within AI, simulation technologies (including C2-Simulation interoperability) and mission sensor and mission data to the digital twin.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table> <thead> <tr> <td><p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p><p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>(a)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(b)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(c)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(d)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(e)</p></td> <td><p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(f)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(g)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(h)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(i)</p></td> <td><p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul><li>Studies: <ul><li>Define scenarios and use cases;</li><li>Identify general operational needs and requirements, and more specifically, needs and requirements for simulation support in COA development, evaluation and wargaming.

As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. It should be noted, however, that large UAS are always challenging to operate due to their specific needs, e.g., regarding facilities, maintenance and support.</p><p>Anticipated advances in miniaturisation and communication protocols are likely to provide sufficient ground for improvements in the area of small UAS for defence applications and their associated payloads, including weapons, without the stringent need for large UAS. Such activities are embedded in very promising prospects for further industrial and operational development.</p><p>Against this background, this topic aims to have a direct impact on the tactical operational effectiveness of armed forces in multi-domain operations (air, land and maritime). In addition, the outcome of this topic is also expected to improve the intervention capacity of relevant national or European agencies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>In particular, this topic intends to contribute to address the following specific challenges that small UAS are prone to:</p><ul><li>Low UAS signatures and extended operational ranges;</li><li>Operate autonomously and automatic, including with assisted piloting considerations;</li><li>Miniaturisation of sensors and payloads, including potential weapons and communication systems;</li><li>Operational capability and survivability in contested, congested and challenging (e.g., weather) airspace.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address the development of a small UAS with advanced ISTAR capabilities, such as real-time imagery intelligence, and possibly kinetic capabilities, capable of operating in support of the widest possible range of military operations.</p><p>In addition, proposals should address the development of a multi-role approach that explores compatibility between different payloads and configurations, in particular through an Interoperable Modular and Scalable Architecture (IMOSA) approach to allow interchangeability of components and interoperability between different solutions, including a 'plug and play? capability for sensors and possible effectors.</p><p>As the small UAS cannot support sets of different sensors due to weight, space and power limitations, the possibility of standard interfaces should be explored to allow the selection and integration of a variety of specific sensors to be used in different configurations depending on the mission, and to facilitate the use in defence, civil and dual-use configurations.</p><p>In addition, proposals may also address the potential synergy for use by law enforcement and other governmental use.</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists

It is continuously being developed through standardisation activities in 3GPP, and new releases with extended features of the standard are approved approximately every 18 to 24 months.</p><p>To ensure a technological edge in military use of 5G, it is important to capitalise on the continued momentum of new releases and associated features relevant for military operations. In 2016, resilience in civil communication systems was listed by NATO as one of seven baseline requirements that each Member State should measure their level of preparedness. In November 2019, this requirement was updated by NATO Defence Ministers, who stressed the need for reliable communications including 5G.</p><p>To address this statement and ensure a higher degree of robustness and resilience in military operations when operating in the tactical edge, the militaries should be able to exploit and seamlessly interact with civilian infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted services for tactical command and control applications.</p><p>This topic focuses on system level integration and orchestration of 5G technologies for seamless interaction of private military and public 5G networks. Hence, the overall objective is to support the need for an always connected concept enabling military applications to roam securely through a mix of private and public networks. To achieve this, there is a need to study, develop and demonstrate how the military can exploit seamless and uninterrupted transfer of secure applications and services in a coverage area served by a mix of private military and public 5G networks, including BLoS (Beyond Line of Sight) through Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) communication systems integrated in 3GPP standard.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific challenge of this topic is to demonstrate robust and dynamic operational capabilities of 5G connectivity solutions matching the military needs for tactical command and control applications and services.</p><p>The solution should always be connected via a hybrid form of networks, while ensuring secure communications, using tactical networks, private military and public 5G networks and other federation solutions. The use of flexible reach back solutions such as 5G NTN is also necessary to reach shared centralised cloud services.</p><p>Within this context, secure integration of commercial and military hardware, software and services is a fundamental challenge that must be addressed on both a technological and a commercial level.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address the development of either integrated private-public 5G system architectures for military operations, or private military 5G networks, or public 5G services for military applications.</p><p>Moreover, proposals should lead to the development and demonstration of case-agnostic technical products and services, applicable to military operations across all dimensions of warfare.

In recent years, the opportunities offered by Systems-On-a-Chip have become very apparent in many different technology sectors such as telecommunications, military, automotive, financial, medical research, and others.</p><p>Fundamental to this development is the integration of processing hardware, embedded programming software and firmware and high-speed digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital technology with low power consumption technology into a single component.</p><p>There is a need to invest in a European RF-CMOS supply chain and measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations connected to military applications. Building on the learnings from the GaN-supply chain cooperation, and based on the growing demand for integrated circuits, a European supply chain initiative, catalysed by military needs, is likely to become a very important tool for future European prosperity and for ensuring a long-term strategy of non-dependence for critical defence technologies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply and to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies. The action should define strategies for development and ownership of advanced RF-CMOS supply chain in Europe, possibly a European Silicon foundry base aiming for advanced technology nodes for analog (RF) and digital circuits, as well as technologies or methodologies that enable use of other foundries without compromising assurance, where assurance pertains to both availability of the supply chain and its security.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The scope consists of two interacting parts:</p><ul><li>The development of RF-CMOS components and modules connected to current and future military applications, including the requirements for a production supply chain.</li><li>How a non-dependent RF-CMOS European supply chain could be gained, or at least how measures to mitigate the risk of export limitations, high cost for low volume production or other limiting factor for a European supply chain can be implemented. A European supply chain must, but is not limited to, include one or more RF-CMOS fabrication site(s), mask generation, supply of wafers and other important raw materials necessary for advanced RF-CMOS processing. It may also include packaging and testing facilities.</li></ul><p>Proposals must include studies, such as feasibility studies to explore new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions.</p><p>Proposals should identify which components and modules are relevant for future systems and which manufacturing facilities are needed for such components and modules.</p><p>The action should develop a strategy for a European RF-CMOS fine pitch supply chain for manufacturing of high-speed and high-performance functional building blocks (data converters and FPGA) in the next generations of digital AESA Radar, wideband multifunctional RF systems. The nodes for each circuit (analog and digital) could be different to optimise the performance and be assembled with a system in package technology.</p><p>Taking in account the existing European manufacturing facilities and the civil programs such as CHIP JU, proposals should propose a design with a view to ensure:</p><ul><li>The non-dependence for defence systems integrating this RF-CMOS solution.</li><li>The cost efficiency of the solution for low volume quantities (including NRE).</li></ul><p>The proposals must avoid unnecessary duplications with other EU, intergovernmental or NATO

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Digitising dynamic objects, processes and practices</li><li>Monitoring the evolving status of cultural heritage objects over time</li><li>Interacting with, cross-mixing and re-mixing different data types</li></ul><p><strong>Digitisation of dynamic objects, processes and practices</strong></p><p>The main focus of 3D digitisation initiatives in the realm of cultural heritage has thus far been the shape and appearance of static objects. Practical techniques and technologies that enable accurate physical simulations of digitised items are mostly unexplored. Mechanical characteristics like stiffness, flexibility, mass distribution and strength, as well as mechanisms and moving parts are still largely undocumented. However, many heritage objects, including human-made devices, machines or practices, exhibit dynamic behaviours. Making adequate and precise digital models of such items and phenomena would enable more realistic simulations of, for instance, ancient artefacts like tissues, mechanisms, tools or practices, which would facilitate more insightful analysis and understanding.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop new digitisation approaches enabling the correct capture of mechanical and dynamic characteristics of objects and practices.</p><p><strong>Monitoring the evolving status of cultural heritage objects over time</strong></p><p>Monitoring the evolution over time of a heritage object is a key task in many cultural heritage contexts. This involves monitoring very slow phenomena (e.g. changes in the reflection attributes of a painted surface) as well as very rapid ones (for example fractures introduced by an abrupt event, such as damages to a loan artwork while traveling, or to a monument due to a seismic impact). The accurate sampling and detection of such changes occurring over time requires a number of new and integrated technologies: shape &amp; colour sampling, use of networks of sensors displaced in a space, data integration, and software technologies able to make comparisons and to assess the changes. Innovative AI-based solutions may be developed to characterise and detect the changes, subject to the validation of human experts.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop new digitisation approaches enabling an unprecedented capability to monitor the evolution over time of the status of heritage objects.</p><p><strong>Interacting with, cross-mixing and re-mixing different data types</strong></p><p>Mixing and integrating different media and media types in effective ways can expand insight capabilities, and lead to new knowledge generation. Projects funded under this topic should develop innovative tools and methods that give the ECCCH ground-breaking capabilities in this area.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should explore how different media can be combined, using both the space and time axes, and how the creative processes involved can be supported. Such new methods will require studying new interaction modes, enabling the navigation over different media types and spaces (2D, 3D, text, ?), and creating a common cross-media interaction language. Users should easily be able to use multiple media in a coordinated manner, for instance for the visual presentation and analysis of heritage objects (e.g. interconnecting 3D and text to tell the story of an artwork, intermixing the navigation of a 3D space and panoramic images to present both spatial and surface colour/reflection characteristics in an accurate manner, enabling the navigation of datasets which join 3D scanned external surfaces with computer tomography scanned data of the interior, or using 3D and images in the documentation of restoration). The tools and methods developed should allow the representation of non-static heritage, such as industrial heritage with many complex machines and processes. As an alternative to producing full digital models of complex machinery, which may be excessively expensive, different media may be combined to represent the dynamic essence of such assets with less effort, for instance using 3D models for the static characteristics of a machinery and adding video and sound to enhance the dynamic experience.</p><p>The work produced may be implemented as new specific tools, and/or as extensions to the functional libraries included in the core ECCCH platform.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions.

It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people.

They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.</p><p>The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[<sup></sup>Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? (ECCCH).</p><p>An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[<sup></sup>European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv�nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014</a>]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.</p><p>The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[<sup></sup>See further <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces</a>]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.</p><p>Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:</p><ul><li>The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[<sup></sup>In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.</li><li>The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.</li><li>Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.</li><li>To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.</li><li>The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: <ul><li>digital twins of heritage objects,</li><li>digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,</li><li>digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role.</li> </ul></li><li>The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.</li><li>An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.</li><li>The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.</li><li>The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.</li><li>The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives.</li></ul><p>The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.</p><p>All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:</p><ul><li>All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[<sup></sup>]] and the Open Source Initiative[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://opensource.org/licenses"">https://opensource.org/licenses</a>]].</li><li>If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.</li><li>All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.</li><li>All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'</li></ul><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li>The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.</li></ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Metadata enrichment</li><li>Embedding scientific and professional value as well as IP and other associated rights throughout the digital content production chain</li><li>Collaboration- and business models based on the multi-actor value chain</li></ul><p><strong>Metadata enrichment</strong></p><p>The last decades have seen a growing mass of uninterpreted or misinterpreted data related to cultural heritage assets. Innovative methods are needed to achieve a massive production of semantically enriched digital resources in the context of multidisciplinary research and professional activities.</p><p>To make cultural heritage content findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), and facilitate discoverability, digital objects must be tagged with good quality metadata. This raises several issues that need to be considered in the design and use of the ECCCH, such as metadata models for different application domains, vocabularies and ontological structures, multilingualism, efficient interfaces for accessing and managing metadata and paradata, effective implementation and reuse of existing models for heterogeneous applications, as well as sustainable maintenance of metadata as the real world and its conceptualisations evolve over time.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop and test innovative tools for human-driven acquisition, categorisation and annotation of digital objects (e.g. texts, images, 3D models, sounds or videos) combined with new AI-based approaches, resulting in high-quality content and metadata. Methods building on citizen science like approaches may also be considered. The tools should foster the emergence of new collaborative data curation scenarios within a multidisciplinary and multisectoral framework. They should further support innovative data interlinkage between cultural heritage objects and related actors, enabling a semi-automatic mutual enrichment process where data are completed and enhanced by detecting and integrating related sources of knowledge.</p><p><strong>Embedding scientific and professional value as well as IP and other associated rights throughout the digital content production chain</strong></p><p>With the digital transformation of the cultural heritage area, large amounts of digital resources are emerging. However, a considerable part of this data remains inaccessible in private repositories.</p><p>The ECCCH should support the transition from massive production of raw data related to activities on cultural heritage objects, to semantically rich and collectively produced digital resources (digital commons). In this context, a key to encourage data sharing is the adequate control of who may use the material created and/or curated, and of how it will be used.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop innovative tools and methods to turn the massive digitisation effort into an opportunity to record and share not only the digital resources (with basic metadata), but also the methods and processes that led to their creation (such as human skills, technological and cognitive processes, or scientific protocols). The tools should support cultural heritage researchers and professionals to record the key steps of their activities on cultural heritage objects, ranging from the historical knowledge to the conservation, restoration and dissemination areas. The tools should produce data chains able to represent the complex workflows - often composed of combinations of individual skills and collective decisions - that constitute the creation of digital resources, as well as their progressive enrichment, transformation and re-use. This information should be linked to any data type/data element. The data chains should also embed information for managing ownership and property rights, use rights, and effective re-use of digital resources, in order to enable and encourage contribution to and use of shared repositories. These tools should, to the extent appropriate, be able to deal correctly with the different cases of unclear or contested IPR that may be encountered. The full production and enrichment chain of digital resources should be encoded, as an implicit mechanism to unveil the value chains of multi-actor collaborative productions. Block chains or other methods may be used, able to encode a stream of changes, modifications and re-uses of the digital objects.</p><p>In order to encode this information, extensions to the ECCCH data model might be needed. If so, these extensions should be designed in cooperation with the ECCCH main consortium.</p><p><strong>Collaboration- and business models based on the multi-actor value chain</strong></p><p>Such encoded value chains should enable innovative business models in collaboration with for instance cultural and creative industries. For this use, projects funded under this topic should introduce and experiment with collaboration- and business models for the data objects stored in the ECCCH, as well as the required web-based infrastructure to allow commercial collaborations. Such actions should be subject to the explicit authorisation of the owner institutions, and revenues shared with those institutions, based on the IPR information from the data value chains.</p><p>Particularly in the context of sharing and re-use of digital cultural resources, the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as the European Open Science Cloud, might be valuable resources. Developments under these initiatives should be taken into account, as appropriate, in order to explore potential synergies and ensure complementarity.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic may, as appropriate, exploit and contribute to the European Open Science Cloud cross-domain interoperability framework and build on work by previous large-scale projects like PARTHENOS and SSHOC, as well as on data enrichment tools and activities in the context of the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. Furthermore, in order to exploit potential synergies, proposals should consider, when appropriate, to build on the work of the coordination project on the European Open Science Cloud Architecture and Interoperability Framework resulting from topic HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-05. </p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users.

Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Creating, sharing and re-using interactive content</li><li>Analysing, designing and testing interactions with visitors</li></ul><p><strong>Creating, sharing and re-using interactive content</strong></p><p>Cultural heritage institutions regularly produce interactive content; for visitors to facilitate the comprehension of the exhibits on display, to entertain them or for research purposes. The platform used to deploy the content may be a simple interactive presentation device (e.g. a PC, a tablet or a mobile app) or more sophisticated immersive devices (large screens, VR rooms, head-mounted displays, specific interaction languages and related devices, etc.).</p><p>The common practice in creating interactive content at cultural heritage institutions is single theme - single institution - no cooperation. This approach makes production costs high, often prohibitively high, since the content is designed from scratch and presented only to a limited audience.</p><p>The challenge is to popularise and democratise the production and use of interactive content for cultural heritage. Innovation based on the ECCCH should make this possible.</p><p>The tools and methods developed should include an easy-to-use authoring system, designed for a community of users which may not be able to master fully-fledged commercial authoring systems. Resources should be developed to facilitate the creation of content and the adoption of a cooperative approach that enables the reuse of components and previous productions. The tools developed should be capable of supporting the entire value chain, including for instance freelancers and small companies, educational institutions, non-profits, etc.</p><p>The tools should support creation of multimedia content on top of basic components by using digital data in the ECCCH and as appropriate from other platforms, such as the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. Using existing components should reduce the digitisation costs of interactive media productions, since a considerable part of the required models and images will already be available.</p><p>The tools should allow re-using portions of content contributed to the ECCCH by other partners. The ECCCH support for explicit tracking of data (re-)use will be key. Data on provenance and reuse of the digital assets should be acknowledged and maintained.</p><p>The tools should also offer the capability to adapt the presentation to more sophisticated contexts, such as non-immersive systems mixing 3D models with high quality visual interfaces and metadata and videos, virtual reality settings providing a strong immersive experience, or virtual worlds/metaverse environments.</p><p>Produced content should be deployable seamlessly on interactive kiosks in exhibition spaces and on web-based platforms, allowing to break the physical walls of the institution and widening the potential audience. Its metadata should allow the produced content to be shared also on other European platforms and data spaces.</p><p><strong>Analysing, designing and testing interactions with visitors</strong></p><p>A common task in cultural heritage is to evaluate if the design of an exhibition - in a real or digital space - is functional and sufficiently impactful and meaningful for the audience. Common queries may include how people move around, which specific content they pay attention to, if they are able to appreciate the exhibits in a proper manner, which areas are most crowded, which points are of more or less interest, etc.</p><p>Also, designing an exhibition is a complex task encompassing many activities related to the 3D space and visitors' perceptions, such as subdivisions of the exposition space, planning the visiting path, distribution of the exhibits and of didactic materials, lighting setup, etc.</p><p>A 3D representation of the exposition space is a basic resource for both types of actions. While architectural CAD tools may in some cases provide support, these are often prohibitively complex and do not correspond well to the needs of the cultural heritage sector.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods for designing and providing simulated and real data mapping over an exposition. Focus should be on the specific needs of cultural heritage professionals, and on the ease of use.</p><p>The tools should be capable of generating preliminary assessments based on digital mock-ups, and assessments based on real physical spaces. Digital mock-ups of an exposition space could be navigated with interactive or virtual reality equipment, while specific equipment would be needed to gather data on users' navigation and interaction with a real physical space.</p><p>The tools should also allow to design an exposition space, introducing separations, openings and pedestals etc. which allow creating a planned path, and smaller spaces inside larger physical exposition spaces, positioning the exhibits and setting a proper illumination.</p><p>The tools should support collaborative work and sharing of resources and results through the ECCCH.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.</p><p>Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.</p><p>The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.</p><p>Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.</p><p>The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.</p><p>Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.</p> <p>'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.</p><p>'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.</p>",,"<p>Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment.

Concrete applications of these tools and methods should be provided for at least the following uses:</p><ul><li>Supporting the study of cultural heritage objects</li><li>Supporting conservation and restoration works</li></ul><p><strong>Supporting the study of cultural heritage objects</strong></p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods which build on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH to allow cultural heritage professionals and researchers to structure, encode, store and analyse all knowledge needed for the study of a cultural heritage object such as artworks, prints, drawings, etc. Such combined use of multiple types of digital visual and other data available on the ECCCH could revolutionise current methodologies in research, documentation and didactics related to the study of cultural heritage objects. The tools would enable visualisation and measurement, support analysis and documentation of the reasoning process (e.g. via annotations or metadata), and build on highly accurate digital representations of the object (2D, 3D, 4D) stored in the ECCCH. The tools should allow to access, interlink, enhance, enrich and archive all necessary knowledge. Search-by-similarity queries should be possible over the ECCCH, based on innovative AI solutions.</p><p>The focus is not only on documenting and archiving multiple heterogeneous documents, but also on identifying, storing and visualising connections among those assets. The digital twin of the cultural heritage object should be a spatial index for structuring and presenting all this knowledge. A cooperative approach should be enabled, with full control of who can access what.</p><p><strong>Supporting conservation and restoration works</strong></p><p>In the cultural heritage field, many different types of data are typically used to describe and monitor the condition of objects for conservation and restoration purposes, such as survey data, scientific imaging, reports, maps of degradation, photographic collections, historical archives, material sample analyses, etc. Many different professional disciplines are involved in data collection, processing and analysis (e.g. art history, architecture, conservation, materials science and engineering). Data collection, processing and analysis is an extremely complex task, performed both before and during restoration/conservation works.</p><p>For this use, projects funded under this topic should develop tools and methods to collect, manage and use data - with associated knowledge - for conservation and restoration purposes. These tools should build on the digital twins of cultural heritage objects stored in the ECCCH and enable users to structure, encode, store, and analyse all resources needed for conservation assessment, restoration planning, and for documentation of restoration results, within a well-defined and dynamic collaborative framework.</p><p>To cater to the needs of the wide range of professionals involved, the tools should address at least:</p><ul><li>Capture and management of information about material objects (including static and dynamic sensor networks), ensuring continuously updated digital twins in the ECCCH.</li><li>Characterisation of the physical state of artefacts through analysis of material samples, scientific imaging, simulation of behaviours, etc.</li><li>Efficient digital tools to assist users in analysis, diagnosis, and decision making.</li><li>Evaluation and validation of documentation (including examination of diagnostic studies), to establish reproducible protocols for other (future) conservation and restoration efforts.</li><li>Monitoring and archiving the conservation/restoration process over time with a long-term perspective, to prevent unnecessary degradation and plan for future restoration activities.</li></ul><p>AI based methods have the potential to play a key role in developing improved methods for solving research questions or gaining insights about data, such as categorisation, segmentation, recognition, analysis, and understanding. The goal should be to semi-automate work-intensive activities that are common in conservation and restoration.</p><p>With a view to use resources efficiently and go beyond the state of the art, projects funded under this topic should, where appropriate, build on previous existing research, methods and solutions. Proposals should therefore ensure that existing tools and methods and their potential (re-)use are properly examined.</p><p>Ease of use for the target users is of paramount importance. Therefore, tools and methods should be developed in close collaboration with actively involved representative target users. Furthermore, tools and methods should be thoroughly tested and verified with a significant number of users before the end of the project. Financial support to third parties may be used to facilitate the engagement with users. The financial support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants.</p><p>In order to facilitate the access for less well-equipped users, the developed software tools should to the extent possible be accessible online without requiring installation nor special or particularly powerful equipment. Also, the developed software tools should to the extent appropriate be designed to allow use and avoid loss of work in situations with unstable or limited connectivity.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should demonstrate the potential of the developed tools and methods through representative case studies, conducted in collaboration with relevant users. These case studies should cover a significant share of the range of cultural heritage objects, materials and issues that the tools and methods intend to address. The results of these case studies should produce information that can serve as models for promoting the re-use of the tools and methods in other contexts and by other users within, and where appropriate beyond, the ECCCH.</p><p>Proposals should, furthermore, foresee appropriate resources to provide clear information and elaborate targeted training modules for users of the developed tools and methods.</p><p>The tools to be developed should be implemented using the low-level libraries established by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. The tools developed should be compliant with the design of the ECCCH, and should be integrated with the ECCCH before the end of the project, together with proper documentation. All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. If appropriate these tools should be developed with a view to a wider deployment, including in the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage, as well as, when appropriate, for reuse via the European Open Science Cloud. Furthermore, content produced by these tools for the ECCCH should be interoperable for sharing, when appropriate, via the Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage and/or the European Open Science Cloud.</p><p>Proposals should furthermore make provisions to actively participate in the common activities of the ECCCH initiative. In particular, projects funded under this topic should coordinate technical work with projects funded under other call topics of the ECCCH initiative, and contribute to the activities and objectives of the project funded under the topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01. Proposals should include a budget for the attendance to regular joint coordination meetings, and may consider covering the costs of any other joint activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage.</p><p>Projects funded under this topic should moreover set up their project websites under the common ECCCH website, managed by the project funded under topic HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01.</p><p>Furthermore, the Commission expects projects funded under this topic to establish regular coordination mechanisms in order to ensure synchronised planning as well as synergy and/or complementarity of deliverables and outcomes.</p><p>The Commission recommends considering reporting periods of 12 months when elaborating proposals.</p><p>Please also refer to the Destination introduction text to consider some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH.</p> <p>'Cultural heritage professionals and researchers' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including all different professions and disciplines involved in the cultural heritage field, such as curators, conservators, researchers, art managers, educators, etc., that may develop their activities for instance at cultural heritage institutions, research organisations, higher education establishments or in the cultural and creative industries.</p><p>'Cultural heritage objects' should in the context of the ECCCH be interpreted as including any form of cultural heritage that can be represented in a digital format: tangible, intangible, born digital; movable objects, buildings, documents, inscriptions, etc.</p>",,"<p>Europe's rich cultural heritage and strong creative tradition not only reflect our past, but also shape our future. It is by building on this foundation and developing our strengths that we can face the great challenges of our time with confidence, and shape a future based on European values and the respect of human rights. Europe's cultural heritage is well alive because it is the result of the interaction between people and their environment, and above all of the collective effort of EU citizens, who all have the same entitlement to enjoy their human and in particular cultural rights.[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://rm.coe.int/1680083746"">CETS 199 - Council of Europe Framework Convention on the Value of Cultural Heritage for Society (coe.int)</a>]]</p><p>Convinced that cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries are an important part of the ""social"" dimension of democracy and sustainability, the Horizon Europe calls under this destination invite suggestions for policies and practices to address, at all levels of action, current challenges and provide innovative responses. Europe's wealth of monuments and sites and its creative diversity of traditions, crafts, arts, architecture, literature, languages, theatre, films, games and music is a unique asset. It enriches our lives, fosters social and cultural cohesion and contributes to a sense of belonging. It also underpins an economy generating more employment than the automotive industry and a similar trade balance as food, drinks and tobacco combined. Many of Europe's multinationals build their international success on the European heritage and creativity. At the same time, the sector is nurturing large numbers of dynamic small and micro enterprises, creating employment not the least for young people and women, while deploying their creativity not only to generate income but also to contribute to social and cultural sustainability, well-being and projecting European values at home and abroad.</p><p>This destination adopts a people-centred perspective and places cultural heritage and the cultural and creative industries at the very heart of the European economy and its sustainable development. European R&amp;I activities under this destination will support and strengthen European cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries essentially under three areas:</p><p>Green: Europe's cultural heritage and its cultural and creative industries need to share their responsibilities for adapting to the consequences of climate change, and mobilise their resources to support European citizens and societies for an inclusive, socially and culturally sustainable climate transition. A participatory approach to European cultural heritage and digital transformations in the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage will guide new endeavours.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, supporting the cultural and creative industries to turn the challenges of the climate transition into opportunities, and become drivers of an inclusive societal transition. R&amp;I actions will foment the development of new environmentally friendly technologies and methods to manage, restore and preserve cultural heritage, with a view to making Europe a world leader in sustainable management of cultural heritage. R&amp;I will also strengthen our capacity to manage anthropogenic threats. Support to the New European Bauhaus initiative is part of this area, integrating the core New European Bauhaus values of sustainability, inclusion and aesthetics.</p><p>Digital: The digital transition promises enormous opportunities for Europe's cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries, but also serious challenges. It is important to ensure that, through the digitisation, EU citizens benefit from cultural heritage and be enabled to contribute to its enrichment. Digitisation should also provide new training opportunities on creative industries for young citizens in less populated areas.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will focus on, for example, innovative approaches to empower the cultural and creative industries, including its many micro enterprises, to reap the benefits of using digital technologies, creating more appealing and valuable products, services and experiences for its users. R&amp;I actions will deepen our knowledge on what, how and why digitised and digital cultural heritage may be exploited, reaping the benefits while avoiding the many pitfalls, and creating societal value. Collaborative platforms for cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries will be supported. A dedicated call, namely HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01, will support the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform for European cultural heritage institutions. Such platforms will strengthen the collaboration and co-creation among cultural heritage institutions and with other stakeholders in the cultural heritage domain, widen access for citizens and strengthen research. Please consider below some key characteristics and specific conditions of the call. Also, cooperation between different actors within the cultural and creative industries and between the CCIs and other economic sectors and industries will be strengthened, creating new market opportunities for CCI stakeholders.</p><p>Innovative: To an ever greater degree, creative and cultural aspects drive socio-ecological innovation, participatory democratic processes and economic growth. Successful new digital and physical products and services need to be appealing and attractive, adapted to cultural particularities. Similarly, societal transformations such as the green and digital transitions depend on behavioural changes, which are largely based on changes in lifestyle, culture and perceptions. In such processes, the human is at the centre, and cultural heritage, the arts and the cultural and creative industries are key.</p><p>R&amp;I actions will cover a variety of subjects, such as strengthening the innovation capacity of the cultural and creative industries, and their capability to act as innovation engines. Actions will focus both on cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries holistically, as an innovation ecosystem, and on specific CCI sectors such as music, filmmaking and video games. Actions will also foment innovation in cultural tourism, as well as explore innovative connections between cultural expressions and democracy and politics. Actions will also support the development of new innovative technologies and methods to restore, preserve and manage cultural heritage, as well as reinforce the role of Europe's cultural heritage in promoting European values among EU citizens and abroad.</p><p>The innovation ecosystems created and nurtured by the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), in particular the KIC 'EIT Culture and Creativity?, may contribute to innovation actions under this destination, and should as appropriate be considered.</p><p>In line with the Commission priorities, R&amp;I actions under this Destination will help promote the European way of life, contribute to achieving the Green Deal goals and support an economy that works for people. They will contribute to the New European Bauhaus[[<sup></sup>The New European Bauhaus initiative was launched by European Commission President von der Leyen in her State of the European Union speech autumn 2020. More information here: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en"">https://europa.eu/new-european-bauhaus/index_en</a>]] initiative, to reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to building a stronger, more participatory and crisis-resilient society and economy. They will support the realisation of the full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative industries as drivers of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging.</p><p>The topics under the calls HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 and HORIZON-CL2-2024-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01 aim at supporting the establishment of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space, including a cloud platform, and contribute to the vision and objectives of the Commission[[<sup></sup>Recommendation (EU) 2021/1970 of 10 Nov 2021 on a common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. ]]. For the purpose of these calls, the collaborative space will be referred to as the 'European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage? (ECCCH).</p><p>An ex-ante impact assessment for the ECCCH was carried out between December 2021 and March 2022 by eight renowned independent experts contracted by the Commission[[<sup></sup>European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation, Brunet, P., De Luca, L., Hyv�nen, E., et al., Report on a European collaborative cloud for cultural heritage : ex - ante impact assessment, 2022, <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014"">https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/64014</a>]]. This ex-ante impact assessment examined and described the needs of a digital European cultural heritage collaborative space from the perspective of the foreseen users (cultural heritage institutions, researchers, cultural and creative industries, etc.) and of European societies, thoroughly reviewed existing initiatives that might satisfy parts of these needs, and outlined the most important aspects to consider in implementing such a collaborative space.</p><p>The conclusion of the ex-ante impact assessment is that the ECCCH is highly important to Europe's cultural heritage institutions and to European societies. In order to address the urgent evolving needs of Europe's cultural heritage sector in the digital age for specifically adapted collaborative spaces, the European Union will ramp up its investments through the ECCCH, and also the common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage (the Data Space)[[<sup></sup>See further <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces"">https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/staff-working-document-data-spaces</a>]] funded under the Digital Europe programme. The topics under the ECCCH calls are based on the conclusions and recommendations of the experts' ex-ante impact assessment.</p><p>Some key characteristics of the vision for the ECCCH include:</p><ul><li>The ECCCH will be addressed to professionals[[<sup></sup>In the context of the ECCCH calls, 'professionals' should be understood as the wide and interdisciplinary group of people working with cultural heritage in a professional or semi-professional way, researchers as well as people working with related activities such as within the cultural and creative industries.]]. It will enable an unprecedented level of lasting collaboration and co-creation between public and private players that will generate new realms of research, knowledge and creation of societal value.</li><li>The basic ECCCH platform will provide easy to use tools for the most important needs.</li><li>Active user communities that contribute to training and support, as well as common data models, guidelines and libraries for developing tools (including support for Graphical User interfaces (GUI) and visualisation), will ensure that also less well-equipped institutions will draw the full benefit of the ECCCH.</li><li>To enhance collaboration and co-creation, IPR rights of the digital objects stored in the ECCCH and produced by ECCCH-based collaboration will be fully recorded and traceable. Guidelines for the use of IPR rights, such as rights statements provided by RightsStatements.org should be used where appropriate. This will enable new business models in the intersection between cultural heritage and cultural and creative industries.</li><li>The long-term sustainability of data and data formats is one of the underlying principles of the ECCCH. The ECCCH will tackle these challenges through its architecture and basic functionalities. The design and architecture of the ECCCH is based on three principles: <ul><li>digital twins of heritage objects,</li><li>digital continuum, tracing all interactions with heritage objects and related data objects,</li><li>digital ecosystem, open to all stakeholders, professions and activities to interact with each other and with the digital heritage objects, ultimately leading towards a new generation of multidimensional, interconnected and knowledge-enhanced heritage data forming digital commons, where the ECCCH will play a key role.</li> </ul></li><li>The architecture of the ECCCH will ensure an evolutionary design, which will allow the adaption and incorporation of new technologies and tools and to fulfil new user requirements, while discontinuing less used tools.</li><li>An open Application Programming Interface will allow new functionality to be developed and incorporated in the ECCCH by different initiatives, and encourage interoperability.</li><li>The ECCCH will be open and inclusive, both in terms of the users of the platform and the connections to other related initiatives/platforms such as the Data Space.</li><li>The ECCCH should build on the wealth of existing knowledge, technologies and work processes in Europe. It should draw on previous experience and best practice. The ECCCH and the Data Space should complement each other towards the common vision.</li><li>The ECCCH should ensure, through its Governance body, the engagement of a wide range of appropriate representatives from Member States and Associated Countries, as well as from related EU initiatives.</li></ul><p>The ECCCH will thus be a genuine collaboration platform, which brings together a wide array of professions, researchers and technologies for museums and other cultural heritage institutions. It will include and develop interactive tools for research, curation, restoration, preservation and for reaching out to citizens and cultural and creative industries, properly protect and manage IPR and allow commercial as well as non-commercial collaboration with a wide range of players.</p><p>All topics under the ECCCH calls are subject to the following conditions:</p><ul><li>All software developed should be open source, licensed under a CC0 public domain dedication or under an open source license as recommended by the Free Software Foundation[[<sup></sup>]] and the Open Source Initiative[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://opensource.org/licenses"">https://opensource.org/licenses</a>]].</li><li>If the use of fully open source software would require disproportional efforts or significantly diminish the quality or performance of the software, and if suitable non open source function libraries exists, such libraries may be used provided that a full user license free of charge for an unlimited period of time is granted to the consortium responsible for the ECCCH as well as to all users of the ECCCH.</li><li>All software and other related deliverables should be compliant with the data model and the software development guidelines elaborated by the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'.</li><li>All projects funded should participate in concertation activities with the project funded under topic 'HORIZON-CL2-2023-HERITAGE-ECCCH-01-01'</li></ul><p><u>Expected impacts:</u></p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan:</p><ul><li>The full potential of cultural heritage, arts and cultural and creative sectors as a driver of sustainable innovation and a European sense of belonging is realised through a continuous engagement with society, citizens and economic sectors as well as through better protection, restoration and promotion of cultural heritage.</li></ul><p>Legal entities established in China are not eligible to participate in Innovation Actions in any capacity.

It aims to develop and deploy approaches that bring actors, markets, frameworks and innovative solutions together to increase the attractiveness of building performance up-grades and to reduce the administrative, logistic and financial burden that still goes along with (deep) retrofitting of buildings. The topic also aims to address the need for quality data to make verification and financing more robust and to help deploy services that valorise building energy efficiency and smartness. Proposals should, where appropriate, explore synergies, while linking to, building on, complementing or promoting the market uptake of results from projects funded under other EU programmes, notably Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe. </p><p>Proposals are expected to focus on <u>one</u> of the two scopes (A or B) established below. In their introduction, proposals should clearly identify one scope against which the proposal shall be evaluated. In case a proposal addresses elements of more than one scope, this should be duly justified. </p> <span>Scope</span>:<p><strong>Scope A: Facilitating large-scale deep renovation</strong><strong></strong></p><p>Actions under Scope A should stimulate volume and demand of deep renovation, by aggregating demand and deploying business models for district level deep renovation projects, by rolling out tools such as building renovation passports or by improving coordination of small and medium actors in the supply chain.</p><p>The topic welcomes action in all markets regardless of their readiness or maturity, and in particular in less mature markets.</p><p>Proposals should explain and adapt the proposed activities to the context in which they will be acting.</p><p>Applicants are referred to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive which provides legal definitions for concepts such as 'deep renovation?, 'staged deep renovation? or 'zero emissions building?. Besides energy efficiency upgrades and the switch to sustainable energy sources, proposals should consider Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) and comfort aspects.</p><p>Proposals should address at least one of the following areas/aspects:</p><ol> <li>Remove market barriers and stimulate the development of business models for the implementation of large-scale deep renovation projects, e.g. at district or neighbourhood level. Proposals should make the whole renovation process easier and more attractive for all those involved, from construction stakeholders and investors to building owners and occupants. Proposals should facilitate demand mobilisation and aggregation and the links between supply and demand, e.g. interaction between building owners, managers and suppliers. Proposals should not focus on technology and/or material development, but on rolling-out market-ready technology and packages and targeting building segments or typologies that would allow for a fast and large-scale deployment. Proposals can also address standardisation of building renovation solutions and circularity-related aspects where relevant. Proposals can address the roll out of materials and solutions that improve energy efficiency and wellbeing in buildings, including industrialised prefabrication and modular solutions or other solutions, considering also circular and bio-based materials. Proposals should seek to reduce construction costs, time on site for renovations, to reduce material use and the impact of potential supply-side disruptions, to improve carbon footprint and whole life cycle emissions, and to increase circularity. On top of technical solutions, business models, financing solutions, performance guarantees, design and procurement processes should be taken into account.</li><li>Roll out renovation passports for buildings. This is a tool introduced by the recast of the EPBD, to equip building owners planning a staged renovation of their buildings. Renovation passports provide a clear strategy for staged renovation with the objective to transform the building into a zero-emission building by 2050, helping owners and investors plan the best timing and scope for the interventions, and linking to finance and funding schemes. As indicated in the revised EPBD, Member States will have to introduce a scheme of renovation passports, in order to give their citizens access to the use of this tool. Therefore, proposals should follow the evolutions in the territories where they will be working and align with the EU and national frameworks where available. The interrelation of this tool with other building related instruments should be considered, i.e. energy performance certificates and digital building logbooks. Proposals should also coordinate with existing support and funding schemes and one-stop-shops or renovation support services for homeowners in their area of action.</li><li>Remove barriers linked to the lack of coordination between the different actors and trades involved in the supply side of renovation works (in particular SMEs and individual craftspeople), and the capacity needed in the sector to deliver the 'Renovation Wave? objectives. Actions should incentivise collaboration and result in the establishment of partnerships and consortia able to deliver business models and long-lasting collaboration models between MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) which effectively reach the building and homeowners and enable deep renovations with guarantees (including the switch to efficient renewable-based heating and cooling), reducing risks and transaction costs for companies. This could include standardising contractual aspects, e.g. liabilities in case of low quality work, putting together different trades and/or training them to deliver joint quotes and work together on projects for deep renovation, ensuring a more robust information sharing between companies, showcasing integrated offers for deep renovations to potential customers, etc. These activities could be linked to the services provided by one stop shops for renovation, marketplaces, or other facilitation structures. Proposals should also integrate aspects related to quality and guarantees, giving confidence to present and future customers, including for example potential linkage of performance guarantees to payments and procedures for post-completion evaluation of works to integrate lessons learnt. Proposals should ensure uptake of the results in the targeted local, regional and/or national markets, and for the sub-sector of the building stock tackled, for example through the involvement of professional organisations/associations and/or other relevant stakeholders.</li></ol><p><strong>Scope B: Buildings energy data and services </strong><strong></strong></p><p>Actions are expected to improve the availability, quality and accuracy of buildings data and the access to these for multiple usages and parties including financial institutions and data aggregators; they are moreover expected to explore and foster the use of data for the development and financing of services that enhance the energy performance of buildings and the efficiency of the system.

It should also be noted that the innovation uptake process starts before the R&amp;I cycle is triggered, and it is not finalised with the successful termination of a research project. Therefore, the uptake challenge extends beyond the realm of R&amp;I. However, from within R&amp;I it is possible, if not to materialise the uptake in every case, at least to pave the way towards its materialisation.</p><p>To that aim, there is a need to create a favourable environment that is designed with the main purpose of increasing the impact of security R&amp;I, that is visible and recognisable to those interested in contributing to this aim, and which provides bespoke tools that serve to tackle the factors that hinder innovation uptake.</p><p>The SSRI Destination has therefore been designed with this purpose to serve equally to all the expected impacts of Cluster 3. Research applied in this domain will contribute to increasing the impact of the work carried out in the EU security Research and Innovation ecosystem as a whole and to contribute to its core values, namely: i) Ensuring that security R&amp;I maintains the focus on the potential final use of its outcomes; ii) Contributing to a forward-looking planning of EU security capabilities; iii) Ensuring the development of security technologies that are socially acceptable; iv) Paving the way to the industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and deployment of successful R&amp;I outcomes; and v) Safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>While the other Destinations of this Horizon Europe Cluster 3 Work Programme offer research and innovation activities to develop solutions to address specific security threats or capability needs, the SSRI Destination will trigger actions that will help bringing these and other developments closer to the market, thus contributing to the measures facilitating the uptake of innovation described in the Commission staff working document on security research. Those actions will help developers (including industry, research organisations and academia) to accelerate product development and improve the valorisation of their research investment. They will also support buyers and users in materialising the uptake of innovation and further develop their security capabilities.</p><p>In addition, the SSRI Destination will offer an open environment to create knowledge and value through research in matters (including technology, but also social sciences and humanities) that are not exclusive of only one security area, but cross-cutting to the whole Cluster. This will contribute to reducing thematic fragmentation, bringing closer together the actors from different security domains, and expanding the market beyond traditional thematic silos.</p><p>Finally, SSRI will allow the allocation of resources to the development of tools and methods to reinforce the innovation cycle itself from a process standpoint, thus increasing its effectiveness, efficiency and impact. This Destination will contribute to the development of the tailored analytical capacity required for the adoption of capability-driven approaches, in line with the provisions of the Action Plan on synergies between civil, defence and aerospace industries[[COM(2021) 70.]] and with the measures set out in the Commission staff working document on security research aimed at fostering a forward-looking capability-driven approach in security.</p><p>In order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following impacts:</p><ul><li>A more effective and efficient evidence and knowledge-based development of EU civil security capabilities built on a stronger, more systematic and analysis-intensive security research and innovation cycle;</li><li>Increased cooperation between demand and supply market actors, including with actors from other domains, fosters swift industrialisation, commercialisation, adoption and deployment of successful outcomes of security research and reinforces the competitiveness and resilience of EU security technology and industrial base and safeguards the security of supply of EU-products in critical security areas;</li><li>R&amp;I-enabled knowledge and value in cross-cutting matters reduces sector specific bias and breaks thematic silos that impede the proliferation of common security solutions. </li></ul><p>Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.</p>",,,

Technological developments in areas like machine learning for analytics, user interfaces as well as storage applications have the potential to improve related capabilities.</p><p>Modern urban environments and interconnected infrastructures create constantly big amounts of data. In addition, other sources can be exploited to support the identification and analysis of risks to infrastructures. Therefore, research on enhanced risk anticipation through real-time data analysis has the potential to lead to useful tools to enhance preparedness (contingency plans, scenario-based exercises, allocation of resources, etc.).</p><p>Resilience of smart cities is marked by a set of specific requirements taking into account most notably aspects from the integration considering user centred approaches as well as social and ethical aspects of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), AI/ Machine Learning approaches for real-time data analytics, ensuring transparency, sufficient knowledge and their operational challenges in this area.</p><p>While the availability of larger amounts of data from different sources offers potential to improve the identification of possible risks to infrastructures, it also increases the demand for fast and resilient analytical tools. There is a need to filter information to identify data that is relevant as an indicator for risks and - given the large number of different forms of cyber-attacks or intrusions - also a need to prioritise and decide according to the degree of danger they present. This implies the need for matching data in the appropriate context and verifying the source with a view of ensuring that only relevant data is analysed, thus avoiding false results. Faster identification and localisation of hazardous agents and contaminants inside the infrastructure networks is a key to allow for quick response, inform and involve citizens and residents as well as avoid large-scale damage of any incident. Such identification capabilities can be deployed as part of the infrastructure and integrate with the systems public authorities use to make sure information is available as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop methods for better cooperation between different actors to ensure a common understanding and interpretation of data and to provide interactive tools for exchange and visualisation for decision support. Cooperation between different public and private actors is essential in this regard.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related innovation activities.</p> <span>Specific Topic Conditions</span>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.</p></p>",,"<p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway to contributing to the following expected impact of the Horizon Europe Strategic Plan 2021-2024:<em>'[?] resilience and autonomy of physical and digital infrastructures are enhanced and vital societal functions are ensured, thanks to more powerful prevention, preparedness and response, a better understanding of related human, societal and technological aspects, and the development of cutting-edge capabilities for [?] infrastructure operators [?]?</em></p><p>More specifically, proposals should contribute to the achievement of one or more of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Ensured resilience of large-scale interconnected systems infrastructures and the entities that operate them in in case of complex attacks, pandemics, natural and human-made disasters, or the impacts of climate change;</li><li>Upgraded systems for resilience of the operators and the protection of critical infrastructure to enable rapid, effective, safe and secure response and without substantial human intervention to complex threats and challenges, and better assess risks ensuring resilience and open strategic autonomy of European infrastructures;</li><li>Resilient and secure smart cities are protected using the knowledge derived from the protection of critical infrastructures and systems that are characterised by growing complexity.</li></ul><p>The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022.</p><p>Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other international events.</p>",,,

These methods have proven very effective in understanding offender behaviour and interaction of online service providers, and have ultimately facilitated the shutting down of communication channels used by these offenders, as well as their prosecution. An increasingly important need for Police Authorities' activity in these spaces is the ability to effectively infiltrate particularly dangerous online groups of offenders, while making sure that the evidence obtained will be admissible in court. EU values and fundamental rights shall stay in the core of any future measures. Research in this area should tackle legislative frameworks to collecting evidence in online, including undercover, investigations of child sexual abuse, leading to guidelines and manuals that would make the capability available across the EU to target these offenders more effectively. The results of this research topic (training, manuals guidelines) should be shared among all European Police Authorities, notably via CEPOL, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding under this topic. The successful proposal should build on the publicly available achievements and findings of related previous national or EU-funded projects as well as create synergies with similar on-going security research projects from the Calls 2021-2022 on Fighting Crime and Terrorism in the area of digital forensics and countering child sexual abuse, in order to avoid duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact.</p><p>Since the use of undercover agents online could be beneficial in other crime areas too, particularly in counter terrorism, analysis of possibilities for the developed approaches to be adapted to these other crime areas would be welcome.

Part of the complexity of these phenomena lies in the fact that there is neither a single pathway to radicalisation nor a single terrorist profile. Support of extremists is an effect of individual clusters of psychological, personal, social, economic and political reasons. From a gender perspective, women's radicalisation and involvement in violent extremist groups remain relatively under-researched, poorly understood and possibly characterized by misconceptions about women's exclusion from decision-making processes, as well as their significant underrepresentation in bodies countering the phenomena. In situations of conflict and violence, women are often seen as passive, victims, subordinate and maternal, while these could be assumptions reinforcing gender stereotypes. In order to improve understandings of radicalization and gender we need to study how and why gender norms appear as an increasingly contested area of politics with strong mobilizing power. What role gender norms and equality policies play in stabilizing and destabilizing social and political order, and how ideas and norms about gender equality make people react, mobilize and engage politically, at present, in the past and in the future. The entry point for prevention and de-radicalisation efforts are local communities, which are both stakeholders and partners of the law enforcement in this process. Activities aimed at youngsters and adults have to be gender sensitive, and research has to deliver tailored advice and solutions adequately, and proportionately addressing all critical issues.</p><p>Community policing with its multidisciplinary approach seeks the cooperation of local communities and the broad range of public authorities in its efforts of building safe environments. However, those efforts should recognise not only cultural, social and economic diversity of the milieus, but as mentioned above also be gender sensitive.

They support the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' dealing with urgent soil health challenges (see in particular specific objectives 1 to 6 and 8 in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf"">Mission implementation plan</a>). Activities should thereby contribute to meeting the European Green Deal ambitions and targets, such as those related to food and nutrition security, climate, biodiversity, environment and rural areas .</p><p>Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:</p><ul><li>Increased capacities for participatory, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary R&amp;I across EU Member States and Horizon Europe Associated Countries, allowing for effective cooperation and collaboration among research, practice and policy to co-create and test solutions for soil health.</li><li>Enhancement of soil health in rural or urban areas where living labs are deployed, based on an established monitoring framework.</li><li>Practice-oriented knowledge and tools are more easily available to land managers and contribute to an enhanced consideration and uptake of effective solutions for soil health and related ecosystem services across territories and sectors, in regions where the selected living labs are operating.</li><li>Policy makers in the EU and Associated Countries are more aware of local needs and differences with regard to soil health and can use this knowledge to design more effective policies.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>While more research is needed to restore and maintain healthy soils in the EU and Associated Countries, an important barrier still encountered to accelerate the transition towards a climate-neutral and 'green? European Union is the gap between science and practice, between knowledge and implementation. The Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' proposes a novel approach to research and innovation in the area of soil health, including the implementation of living labs. Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition towards healthy soils by developing solutions in a co-creative manner and involving actors in real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact.</p><p>Nowadays, there exist various definitions and conceptualizations of living labs. However, three components are recognizable within the now well-established living labs research concept, which include (a) co-creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out in real-life settings and (c) involving the end-users . For the purpose of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe', soil health living labs are defined as 'user-centred, place-based and transdisciplinary research and innovation ecosystems, which involve land managers, scientists and other relevant partners in systemic research and co-design, testing, monitoring and evaluation of solutions, in real-life settings, to improve their effectiveness for soil health and accelerate adoption?.</p><p>Living labs are thus collaborations between multiple actors that operate and undertake experiments on several sites at regional or sub-regional level . Individual sites could be, e.g., farms, forest stands, urban green or industrial areas, enterprises and other locations, where the work is carried out and monitored under real-life conditions.</p><p>Lighthouses, in contrast, are defined as 'places for demonstration of solutions, training and communication that are exemplary in their performance in terms of soil health improvement?. They are individual, local sites (one farm, one forest exploitation, one industrial site, one urban city green area, etc.) that either can be part of a living lab or be situated outside a living lab.</p><p>According to the Mission Implementation Plan, living labs involve actors from different backgrounds, disciplines and/or sectors and are composed of 10 to 20 experimental sites. However, depending on the specific context (e.g., the land use(s), the soil health challenge(s) addressed), applicants can propose living labs with fewer experimental sites. By working together on themes of common interest, the various actors involved in a living lab will be able to replicate actions and solutions, compare results, exchange good practices, validate methodologies and benefit from cross-fertilisation within a local/regional setting. While normally projects run for four years, the duration of soil health living labs may vary and be longer depending on the focus of the work and the soil health challenge(s) addressed.</p><p>More specifically, each of the funded projects should:</p><ul><li>Support the setup of four to five living labs (or more, as applicable to the land use(s) and purpose of the project) to work together on one or more soil health challenge(s), addressing the same or several land use types. The living labs should be located in at least three different Member States and/or Associated Countries. Proposals should describe the rationale for cooperation across the various living labs and explain how the work undertaken will contribute to one or more of the Mission's specific objectives . Proposals should present a realistic combination of a limited selection of variables (e.g., number of soil health challenges addressed, pedo-climatic conditions, land uses, Mission objectives addressed). Living labs exclusively focused on urban areas are excluded from this topic as a dedicated topic is opened in this work programme.</li><li>Establish, based on the projects' goals and objectives, a detailed work plan with the activities to be undertaken in the living labs in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring the co-design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted solutions for the selected soil health challenge(s). Seek practical solutions to the identified problems related to the selected soil health challenge(s), taking into account the relevant drivers and pressures. Proposed solutions should be adapted to the different environmental, socio-economic and cultural contexts in which the living labs are operating. Moreover, activities should address challenges to the scaling up and the transferability of solutions. Living labs working in the area of agriculture are expected to promote sustainable practices, applied across a range of farming systems and benefit both conventional and organic farming. Living labs working on forestry, peat and natural areas are expected to address sustainable management for healthy soils in conjunction with productive biomass and other ecosystem services.</li><li>Establish for each living lab a baseline for the selected soil health challenge(s), in order to allow for an accurate assessment of the conditions and changes of soils in the different sites over time and for monitoring of progress towards the objectives of the respective living labs and the project overall. As appropriate, make use of the set of soil health indicators presented in the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/soil_mission_implementation_plan_final_for_publication.pdf"">Soil Mission Implementation Plan</a> and the descriptors of the proposal for a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en"">Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience</a>.</li><li>Monitor and carry out an assessment of the effects of the developed innovative practices or introduced solutions on soil health and related ecosystem services. This should include a demonstration of the viability (e.g., technical, economic) of the proposed solutions and quantification of the impact of the tested practices and/or solutions on relevant soil health indicators.</li><li>Identify sites that demonstrate high performance in terms of their actions and results on soil health improvement and that may be converted into lighthouses.</li><li>Propose strategies (e.g., financial, organisational) to ensure long-term sustainability and continuity, impact and ambition of the established living labs beyond the Horizon Europe funding, including the identification of possible business models and actions involving local authorities, business communities, SMEs, investors, entrepreneurs including co-funding schemes.</li></ul><p>In line with the nature of living labs, proposals must implement the multi-actor approach. The list of actors will vary depending on features specific to each living lab and can involve different types of actors such as researchers, landowners or land managers, industry (e.g., SMEs), public administrations, representatives of civil society (e.g., consumers, environmental NGOs). Care should be taken to describe the capabilities and roles of the different partners involved, depending on their area of expertise. For example, while some partners may lead the conceptual work and coordinate the work within and across living labs, others may focus on carrying-out experiments, providing advice, testing and validating innovative solutions, or be involved in outreach activities.</p><p>To encourage and facilitate the involvement of different types of actors in the living labs, applicants are reminded of the different types of participation possible under Horizon Europe. This includes not only beneficiaries (or their affiliated entities) but also associated partners, third parties giving in-kind contributions, subcontractors and recipients of financial support to third parties .</p><p>Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of actors in one or more of the living labs can be provided through calls or, if duly justified, without a call for proposals. Applicants are advised to consult the standard conditions set out in Annex B of the General Annexes including those that apply to FSTP.</p><p>Applicants are reminded they can benefit from the services of <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101090738"">NATI00NS</a>, the project dedicated to support potential applicants to the living labs topics.</p><p>In order to increase impact and sustainability, applicants are encouraged to explore and test new (or combination with existing) funding schemes and financial instruments, either public or private (including, for example and for agricultural land, Common Agricultural Policy eco-schemes), involving, where relevant, the finance providers such as public authorities or financial institutions and investors.</p><p>Projects should cooperate and benefit from the services of SOILL, the dedicated 'Living Lab Support Structure' established to provide tailor made advice to participants of living labs and lighthouses in their day-to-day operations, as well as enforce the monitoring of their activities in a systematic way, reporting on the main outcomes and experiences . Proposals should include dedicated tasks and appropriate resources to collaborate with SOILL as well as with other projects relevant to the chosen soil health challenge(s), funded either under the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe' or under other parts and pillars of Horizon Europe or other EU programmes, as appropriate. For the latter these would include networking, attendance to meetings and organisation of joint activities (e.g., workshops, establishing best practices, joint communication or citizen engagement activities).

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[<sup></sup>In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/""><u>https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/</u></a>]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.</p><p>To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.</p><p>To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.</p><p>Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).</p><p>The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en</a>]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.</li><li>Land managers[[<sup></sup>The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.</li><li>A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.</li><li>'Soil literacy?, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.</li><li>More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.</li><li>The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).</li><li>The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[<u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en""><u><u><u>https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en</u></u></u></a></u>]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices.</li></ul><p>Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[<u></u><u><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ejpsoil.eu/"">https://ejpsoil.eu/</a></u></u>]]).</p><p><u>Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:</u></p><p>Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.</p><p>The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[<sup></sup>An'(end-) user? of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:</p><ul><li>How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.</li><li>How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.</li><li>How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.</li><li>How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.</li><li>How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.</li><li>How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.</li></ul><p>In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[<sup></sup>For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en"">https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en</a>]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format</a>]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[<sup></sup>The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format</a>]].</p><p>For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en</a>]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.</p><p>Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups</a>]], is strongly recommended.</p>",,,,

They are relevant for all types of space applications such as navigation, Earth observation, science and defence. Technology deployed on space antennas may find applications also in the civil, terrestrial market.</p><p>A number of challenges and considerations affect current deployable antennas for space applications, hereunder the following:</p><ul><li>the Union's dependency on third countries for specific materials and technologies relevant for antennas, especially large deployable antennas with a diameter at or above 5 meters. That is particularly critical as this technology is also affected by third country export restrictions that are limiting the unrestricted access of Union space industry and therefore that industry's ability to support Union sovereignty.</li><li>the need for the space sector to rely on space qualified technology with high level of quality, reliability, robustness, suitability to space harsh environment demonstrated by in-orbit space demonstration and validation. This approach has an important impact on the final technology cost and time to market.</li></ul><p><u>Expected Outcome</u>: The expected outcomes of this pilot project will allow EU to reduce the dependencies from non-EU countries for the critical space technologies relevant to reflectors and deployable antennas and accelerate time to market. The identification of novel non-dependent materials, techniques to re-use parts, materials from end-of-life assets and antennas for assembly and manufacturing on orbit will contribute to increase EU sovereignty and allow unrestricted access to key, critical space technologies.</p><p>The pilot project is expected to contribute to the above-mentioned challenges and considerations. This will contribute to developing, deploying global space-based services applications and data and contribute to fostering the EU's space sector competitiveness.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The areas of R&amp;I, which needs to be addressed to tackle the above-mentioned expected outcomes are:</p><ul><li>the development of novel techniques and manufacturing technologies for deployable antennas. This shall include efforts in the development of low-cost (e.g. re-usable and commercial off-the-shelf) and short manufacturing-time reflector moulds that are also compatible with larger diameters, at or above 5 meters;</li><li>the replacement of materials needed from outside the Union by developing novel materials and surfaces to ensure equivalent current performance or improved levels in terms of losses, depolarization, bandwidth, efficiency of reflector antennas. That includes paving the way for high data rate transmission by means of antennas operating in frequency bands higher to Ka-Band up to Q/V-Band as well as developing and testing novel materials for demonstrating quality and performance up to technology readiness level 4;</li><li>the identification of methods to retrieve the useful materials or components from end-of-life antennas for reuse in the assembly or manufacturing of new hardware on orbit;</li><li>the definition of concepts for on-orbit assembly of large antennas or re-use of antennas from end-of-life satellites on new assets and the evaluation of trade-offs of various architectures relevant for Earth Observation, Telecom. This shall include the process verification steps (e.g., with support of simulations) related to the assembly process, assuring the necessary level of quality and performance.</li></ul><p>Proposal should address all areas.</p><p>Proposals are expected to promote cooperation between different actors (industry, SMEs and research institutions) and consider opportunities to quickly turn technological innovation into commercial use in space.</p><p>Proposals under this topic should explore synergies and be complementary to already funded actions in the context of technology development at component level as well as developments in the scope of the co-Programmed European Partnership on Globally Competitive Space Systems ('Space Partnership'). In particular, it is expected that projects make use of existing European technologies and/or building blocks at component level contributing to European non-dependence and strengthen competitiveness.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[<sup></sup>In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/""><u>https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/</u></a>]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.</p><p>To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.</p><p>To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.</p><p>Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).</p><p>The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en</a>]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.</li><li>Land managers[[<sup></sup>The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.</li><li>A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.</li><li>'Soil literacy?, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.</li><li>More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.</li><li>The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).</li><li>The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[<u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en""><u><u><u>https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en</u></u></u></a></u>]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices.</li></ul><p>Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[<u></u><u><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ejpsoil.eu/"">https://ejpsoil.eu/</a></u></u>]]).</p><p><u>Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:</u></p><p>Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.</p><p>The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[<sup></sup>An'(end-) user? of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:</p><ul><li>How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.</li><li>How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.</li><li>How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.</li><li>How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.</li><li>How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.</li><li>How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.</li></ul><p>In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[<sup></sup>For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en"">https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en</a>]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format</a>]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[<sup></sup>The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format</a>]].</p><p>For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en</a>]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.</p><p>Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups</a>]], is strongly recommended.</p>",,,,

Notably, the interplay between soil fauna, soil microbial community, soil chemistry, and plant immune responses can be enhanced to harness the potential of soil ecosystem to defend against pathogens, pests and other detrimental organisms and to promote plant health and productivity. By managing soil ecosystems to enhance soil health through farming practices (e.g., crop rotation, use of microbiome solutions, etc.), it is possible to support plant defences, suppress diseases, improve nutrient availability and enhance plant resilience to various stressors.

Healthy soils provide food, clean water, habitats for biodiversity and other important services while contributing to climate resilience[[<sup></sup>In line with the Mission's implementation plan, soil health is defined as ""the continued capacity of soils to support ecosystem services"".]]. We take these services for granted, but in fact, soils are a scarce and a threatened resource, all over Europe and beyond. It is estimated that around 60 of soils in the EU are unhealthy[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/""><u>https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/esdacviewer/euso-dashboard/</u></a>]], mainly because of unsustainable management practices. The effects of climate change are putting further pressure on this key resource. The Mission supports Europe's path to sustainable soil management as part of the wider green transition, in urban as well as rural areas. The Mission's goal is to establish 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030 for the benefit of food, people, nature and climate.</p><p>To reach its goal and objectives, the Mission foresees actions across territories and sectors. It aims at having wide-reaching impact on practices in agriculture, forestry, the food sector and other industries (e.g. biobased and waste) as well as on land use planning in rural and urban areas. The Mission will also tap into the expertise from international partners and contribute to soil health globally.</p><p>To be successful, the Mission requires that stakeholders along the whole agri-food chain, including farmers, other land managers, industries, consumers, public authorities, spatial planners, research and civil society at large, acknowledge the value of soils and actively contribute to soil-friendly practices, including through consumer choices.</p><p>Many of the actions to address soil health have a direct impact on some of the goals of the other EU Missions: carbon sequestration and storage in soils support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and changes in soil structure influence water-retention capacity (Climate Adaptation Mission and Ocean and Waters Mission); targeted nutrient management will lead to improvements in water quality (Ocean and Waters Mission); soils are the foundation of green urban infrastructure and nature-based solutions, e.g. for urban flood protection (Climate-neutral Cities Mission); a reduction in soil pollution reduces the risk of cancer (Cancer Mission).</p><p>The Mission implementation plan specifies the goal and objectives as well as the mode for implementation of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe: 100 living labs and lighthouses to lead the transition towards healthy soils by 2030'[[<sup></sup><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en"">https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/implementation-plans-eu-missions_en</a>]]. Proposals for topics under Work Programme 2023-2024 of this Mission will be part of a wider portfolio of Mission activities. They will contribute to the Mission's goal and objectives, and more specifically to several of the following impacts:</p><ul><li>Increased knowledge on soils and the underlying soil processes is widely available to a range of stakeholders and the wider public, and is used to further inform science, practices and policies to reduce pressures on soils.</li><li>Land managers[[<sup></sup>The term ""land manager"" includes farmers, foresters, urban and spatial planners and other decision-makers in the public or private domain with regard to land use and rural areas.]], industries, businesses, consumers and society at large work together, in particular through Living Labs, to take effective action on soil health across sectors and land uses.</li><li>A wide range of innovations - adapted to local conditions - are in place to address the manifold pressures on soils and improve soil conditions, thus contributing to the specific objectives of the Mission 'A Soil Deal for Europe'.</li><li>'Soil literacy?, awareness and societal engagement, and appreciation of the vital functions of soils is increased, including awareness on the links between healthy soils, nutritious and safe food and a healthy environment.</li><li>More sustainable methods for soil management are applied and contribute to healthy oceans and water, and climate adaptation on land.</li><li>The successful implementation of the Mission supports several EU policy and international commitments ranging from land degradation neutrality, food and nutrition security to biodiversity (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, United Nations Convention on Biodiversity, European Green Deal including the New Soil Strategy or the Long-term Vision for the EU's rural areas and the Common Agricultural Policy).</li><li>The Mission supports the proposal for a Directive on Soil Monitoring and Resilience (Soil Monitoring Law[[<u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en""><u><u><u>https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-directive-soil-monitoring-and-resilience_en</u></u></u></a></u>]]). The Mission is recognised as a key instrument for the implementation of the Directive, and in particular the living labs and activities supporting soil monitoring, soil education and citizens engagement. The Mission Soil will also contribute to the definition of sustainable soil management practices.</li></ul><p>Projects under these calls are expected to liaise closely with the Mission Secretariat and actively contribute to the development of the European Soil Observatory (EUSO), hosted by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). To this end, several topics provide the opportunity to establish formal collaborations with the JRC. Proposals are also encouraged to build on existing research results and best practices (for instance from the EJP Soil projects[[<u></u><u><u><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ejpsoil.eu/"">https://ejpsoil.eu/</a></u></u>]]).</p><p><u>Specific requirements for multi-actor projects:</u></p><p>Proposals submitted for topics requesting to follow the multi-actor approach should meet all requirements listed below.</p><p>The multi-actor approach described here, which is a form of responsible research and innovation, aims to make the research and innovation process and its outcomes more reliable, demand-driven, shared and relevant to society. A multi-actor project ensures the genuine and sufficient involvement of a targeted array of actors, which serves the objectives of the topic. For instance, actors could include but not be limited to: researchers, farmers, foresters and representatives of their professional associations, advisors, land managers and owners, spatial planners, food and bioeconomy businesses, consumer associations, local communities, educators, cultural and creative industries, citizens, civil society organisations including NGOs, and government representatives. The choice of the key actors participating in projects will depend on the objectives of the call topic and the proposals. The actors are essentially the (end-) users[[<sup></sup>An'(end-) user? of project result is a person who is him/herself putting the project results into practice.]] of the project results backed up by any other useful intermediaries and actors who can contribute with further expertise and innovative ideas relevant to the topic's objectives and support communication and dissemination. The genuine and sufficient involvement of different actors should take place over the whole course of the project: from participation in development, planning and experiments to implementation, dissemination of results and a possible demonstration phase. Building blocks for the project proposal are expected to come from science as well as from practice: it is a 'co-creation' process. (End-) users and practitioners are to be involved, not as a study-object, but to use their practical and local knowledge and/or entrepreneurial skills to develop solutions and create 'co-ownership' of results. This will contribute and speed up the acceptance and up-take of new ideas, approaches, and solutions developed in the project. Therefore, a multi-actor project proposal must describe:</p><ul><li>How the proposed objectives and planning are targeting the needs/problems/challenges and opportunities of the (end-)users of the project results.</li><li>How the description of the project concept and in particular the composition of the consortium reflects a balanced choice of relevant key actors who have complementary types of knowledge (scientific, practical etc.), and will ensure a broad implementation of project results which should be ready for practice.</li><li>How the project intends to include existing practices and tacit knowledge. This should be illustrated in the proposals with a sufficient number of high-quality knowledge exchange activities indicating the precise and active roles of the different non-scientific actors in the work. The cross-fertilisation of skills, competencies and ideas between actors should generate innovative findings and solutions that are more likely to be applied on a broad scale.</li><li>How the project will facilitate the multi-actor engagement process by making use of the most appropriate methods and expertise.</li><li>How the project will result in practical and ready to use knowledge, approaches, tools or products, that are easily understandable and freely accessible.</li><li>How outputs ready for practice will feed into the existing dissemination channels most consulted by the (end-) users of the project results in the countries and regions.</li></ul><p>In addition, to ensure EU-wide communication in all areas related to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) specific objectives[[<sup></sup>For areas covered by the CAP specific objectives see Article 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2021/2115 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021 establishing rules on support for strategic plans to be drawn up by Member States under the common agricultural policy (CAP Strategic Plans) and financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2021.435.01.0001.01.ENG]], in particular agriculture, forestry and rural development, and the EU CAP Network - European Innovation Partnership 'Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability' (EIP-AGRI)[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en"">https://eu-cap-network.ec.europa.eu/index_en</a>]], this knowledge must also be summarised in an appropriate number of 'practice abstracts'[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format</a>]] in the common EIP-AGRI format[[<sup></sup>The EIP common format for ""practice abstracts"" is available at: <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/eip-agri-common-format</a>]].</p><p>For areas falling outside the EIP-AGRI[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en</a>]] and CAP specific objectives remit, other similarly effective solutions ensuring dissemination at EU level should be sought.</p><p>Where applicable, involvement of interactive innovation groups, such as EIP-AGRI Operational Groups funded under Rural Development Programmes[[<sup></sup>see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups"">https://ec.europa.eu/eip/agriculture/en/about/operational-groups</a>]], is strongly recommended.</p>",,,,

This is particularly acute in the event of disruption in the transport, power, water supply and communication sectors in highly populated and industrialised areas, or when such events raise the likelihood of cascading effects with severe impacts on communities and the economy that are hard or impossible to predict. The main focus on NaTech risks lies on a thorough understanding of the vulnerability of industrial sites and critical infrastructure, and the potential impact natural hazards can have on such technological resources. This entails the identification of both physical (safety of building facilities and structures) and operational vulnerabilities, often addressing multi-hazard conditions. Innovative methods are required for analysing worst-case scenarios, and informing decision-makers about the crosscutting and shared responses to different crises given available resources.</p><p>Research involving multiple fields of expertise, including spatial information (to be specified), is also required to improve hi-tech capacities for operational response systems to better cope with natural and/or technological disasters occurring in Europe (and in overseas territories) in an integrated manner.

Facilitation of travel across external EU borders went and is further going through remarkable developments thanks to subsequent technological generations, and updated procedures and regulatory frameworks. From automated border control gates to 'no-gate? solutions, and to 'seamless travel?; from secure documents, to digitalised travel documents, and to 'dematerialised travel documents? and 'digital wallets?. All to ease border crossing for travellers, while maintaining border security against illicit or irregular crossings and protecting fundamental rights. This topic aims at exploring and developing enhanced capabilities for securely managing digitalised travel documents used for travel across external borders.</p><p>The proposed solution should be compatible with planned or possible future EU highly digitalised travel documents formats and travel facilitation systems, and with applicable ICAO current and upcoming schemes. The proposed solutions should be compatible or interoperable with relevant existing digitalised travel documents systems.

This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities.

Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.</p><p>Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research &amp;

This reliance spans both the early stages of the production process, for example in agricultural mulch, through to the latter stages in which food and beverages are packaged to enable food transportation, preservation, hygiene and safety, increasing the lifespan of foods and contributing to safety of foods and the retention of their nutritional content.</p><p>Plastic's low cost, durability, and linear use with low levels of recycling is the source of numerous environmental challenges that impact whole ecosystems particularly at the end of life. These environmental impacts are further accentuated by coating agents and formulation additives that deliver a range of functional properties. These additives can in turn leach out into the surrounding environment including air, water, food or animal and human body tissues, in particular during biodegradation.</p><p>This Pathfinder Challenge aims to support ambitious interdisciplinary research that will lead to the development and production of sustainable nature inspired alternatives for food packaging and agricultural production such as, but not limited to, greenhouse and mulch films. These materials must have a reduced environmental impact, through design and production, while delivering the functional characteristics of plastics.</p><p>Proposals should look to bring forward ideas that span the product lifecycle from the development of novel sustainable materials, their design and production through to end of life, while maximising the time and extent of use.

These alternatives shall be circular, safe and sustainable by design and allow for reusability, recyclability and full biodegradability. They must look to address one or more of the current uses of plastics in the food system (e.g.,agricultural mulch, food packaging), and utilise bio-based sources and raw materials such as:</p><ul><li>polymers extracted from nature (e.g.,cellulose, chitin, lignin, keratin)</li><li>natural polymers (e.g.,microbial, fungal and plant materials), or</li><li>synthetic polymers from biobased materials.</li></ul><p>Attention should also be paid to consider regulatory aspects in the development and incorporation of chemical additives that can deliver high sanitary standards for contact with food. The additives must be formulated in a way to meet set of biodegradability criteria and the assessment of the ability of the products to fully biodegrade in natural soil and aquatic environments across the EU.</p><p>All projects must demonstrate at least preliminary evidence of an improved cradle-to-gate and cradle-to-grave lifecycle assessment, when compared to fossil carbon derived plastics and current additives. This lifecycle assessment must take account of environmental, social and economic considerations. The resulting materials and associated processes must over their lifecycle:</p><ul><li>Reduce energy consumption and the carbon footprint</li><li>Reduce water consumption and associated environmental footprint</li><li>Enhance biodegradability, compostability or reusability</li></ul><p>They must also include one or more enhanced functional characteristics for use in the food value chain while minimising or potentially eliminating the harmful effects with a view to:</p><ul><li>increasing shelf life and retaining the nutritional properties of packaged food, and</li><li>enhancing the productivity and functionality of agricultural films</li></ul><p>This could include the use of smart functionalities in responding to environmental conditions and the use of biodegradable electronic features.</p><p>Projects with strong capacity for use beyond food and agriculture (e.g.,packaging for pharmaceuticals) will also be encouraged and prioritised.</p><p>Irrespective of starting point, the resulting outputs of the projects must be shown to be effective for their intended application with, at the very least, a lab-based demonstrator i.e., reach TRL 4 or above.</p><p><strong>Expected outcomes and impacts:</strong></p><p>The projects selected under this Challenge are expected to collectively provide a portfolio of environmentally friendly materials and use cases informed by availability , efficiency and end functionality. Further, funded projects will be expected to work together to develop a robust approach to measure the lifecycle impacts i.e., the environmental, social and economic consideration of the funded projects.</p><p>The successful implementation of these Challenge projects will lead to a paradigm shift in the food and agriculture sector. It will in the medium-term lead to the development of a new group of nature-inspired materials that are commercially viable, environmentally sound and support moves towards a more circular, resource efficient and environmentally sustainable economy. These will help the sector reduce pollution in soils, sediment, inland water and oceans, and decrease contamination of food, animal and human tissues with micro and nano plastic particles and leeched additives.</p>",,,,,

However, these inputs are not always merged into common command-and-control (C2) systems that can inform rapid decision-making.</p><p>The proposed solution(s) should allow improved interoperability (at both back-end and front-end levels), independently of the supplier of the equipment, and ideally interchangeability that enables exchange of information among authorities that use different systems. Compatibility and integration with other information sharing environments, including the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE) is essential in order to support the cross-sectoral and cross-border exchange of information.</p><p>The proposed solution(s) can include the design of open architecture C2 systems, including open standards for APIs and bias-free data models.</p><p>The proposed solution(s) should enable simultaneous connection of different sensors (or of different data, or of different assets, depending by the module) by different suppliers, the flexible tasking and monitoring of surveillance assets like RPAS, and the visualization and manipulation of the data in a single user interface in a seamless way. This will support practitioners to exploit their technology stack in an agnostic way.</p><p>The proposed solution(s) should allow for seamless connectivity between C2 systems from different authorities, and at different coordination levels; include cybersecurity measures and information access segregation capabilities; include concepts of operation, standard operating procedures and common lexicon for joint operations using interoperable systems through the proposed solution(s).</p><p>While the project will mainly focus on enabling capabilities through interoperability and interchangeability, proposals that in the process aim at advancing certain technological components, and integrating them into the solution, are welcome.</p><p>Assuming the project delivers on its goals, EU and Member States authorities should plan to take up the results of the research when compatible with applicable legislation using the financial support of the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI).</p><p>Improving energy efficiency and environmental impact aspects of new security technologies for this capability (e.g. low environmental footprint, low emissions, circular economy aspects and/or self-sustained equipment) would be desirable.</p><p>Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research projects include (non-prescriptive and non-exhaustive): open architecture; user interface and experience; artificial intelligence; UxV; wide-area and long-endurance RPAS and integrated, wide-area RPAS cooperative tasking and management; remote sensors (such as LIDAR or FMCW) on UxVs; vessels-as-sensors; advanced mesh connectivity; automated analysis of abnormal or non-cooperative vessels' behaviour; Virtual and Augmented Reality; standardized mission data models for RPAS tasking and monitoring, ; and/or over-the-horizon detection technologies.</p><p>Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes projects on security research. Proposals should also clearly demonstrate how they aim to complement and avoid overlaps with actions undertaken in the European Defence Fund and its precursors (the European Defence Industrial Development Programme (EDIDP) and the Preparatory Action on Defence research (PADR)), based on the information publicly available and while maintaining a focus on civilian applications only.</p><p>Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and EU level, should the research deliver on its goals.</p><p>Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to address the priorities of the European Border and Coast Guard and of its Agency (Frontex). This should start from the definition of requirements and the design phase of their work, including basing on the EBCG Capability Roadmap when available; and on the engagement with the Agency during the implementation of the project. This perspective should be considered and planned when drafting proposals. Proposals should foresee that Frontex will observe projects' pilots and demonstrations, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of innovations for the border and coast guard community.</p><p>Synergies within civil security can be an asset, for example with Disaster-Resilient Society and Fighting Crime and Terrorism.</p> <p><em>See for instance: </em></p><p><em>- relevant work programmes of the EDF (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf_en""><em>https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf_en</em></a><em>) and of the DEP (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital""><em>https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital</em></a><em>) </em></p><p><em>And information on ongoing projects of:</em></p><p><em>- the EDF (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/edf""><em>https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/edf</em></a><em>) </em></p><p><em>- the DEP (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital""><em>https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital</em></a><em>); </em></p><p><em>Visit the following links for more information on past projects of the:</em></p><p><em>- EDF (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-results;programCode=EDF""><em>https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/projects-results;programCode=EDF</em></a><em>)</em></p><p><em>- EDIDP (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-industrial-development-programme-edidp_en""><em>https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-industrial-development-programme-edidp_en</em></a><em>)</em></p><p><em>- PADR (</em><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/preparatory-action-defence-research-padr_en""><em>https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/preparatory-action-defence-research-padr_en</em></a><em>).</em></p>",,"<p>This Destination addresses, among other, objectives identified by the <strong>Security Union Strategy</strong>[[COM(2020) 795 final.]]<strong></strong>as well as the border management and security dimensions of the <strong>New Pact on Migration and Asylum</strong>[[COM(2020) 609 final.]]<strong></strong>and the<strong> Strategy on the Schengen Area</strong>[[COM(2021) 277 final.]]<strong>.</strong> As such, topics included under the Destination aim at ensuring strong European land, air and sea external borders. This includes: developing strong capabilities for checks at external borders hence safeguarding the integrity and functioning of the Schengen area without controls at the internal borders; compensating the absence of intra-EU border checks; being capable to carry out systematic border checks, including identity, health and security checks as necessary, while facilitating the travel of bona fide travellers and respecting rights and possible vulnerabilities of individuals; providing integrated and continuous border surveillance, situational awareness and analysis support; combating identity and document frauds; supporting future technology for the European Border and Coast Guard; supporting the interoperability and performance of EU data exchange and analysis; supporting better risk detection, incident response and crime prevention; improving European preparedness to, and management of, future rapidly evolving changes; and updating our maritime security management including migration, trafficking as well as search and rescue capabilities. The capabilities built by research and innovation in this Destination would clearly be relevant to be better prepared for potential future challenges to European internal security and crises as the ones in Ukraine in 2022. Furthermore, this Destination will contribute to safeguarding the open strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty of the EU in critical security areas by contributing to a more competitive and resilient EU security technology and industrial base.</p><p>Taking into account the central role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) in defining capability requirements, and proposing the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard to be approved by the Frontex Management Board, and in addition to the contribution from the Member States, the Agency will be closely associated with, and will assist Member States and the European Commission in drawing up and implementing relevant research and innovation activities. Research should follow the indications of the long-term components of the capability roadmap of the European Border and Coast Guard once adopted (expected in 2023).</p><p>The European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (eu-LISA) may also assist the European Commission on relevant research and innovation activities and specific topics.</p><p>Research should also consider how future management of borders can develop protection of human rights, and how it can facilitate protection of refugees.</p><p>This research will also contribute to the implementation of the European Border Surveillance System (EUROSUR) and the development of tools and methods for Integrated Border Management.</p><p>Regarding maritime security, the topics under this Destination will also support the implementation of the relevant actions under the capability development, research and innovation area of the EU Maritime Security Action Plan[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf"">https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/2018-06-26-eumss-revised-action-plan_en.pdf</a>]], and the Joint Communication on a Stronger EU Engagement for a Peaceful, Sustainable and Prosperous Arctic[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN"">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52021JC0027&amp;from=EN</a>]]. Research activities will therefore enable better security and management of EU maritime borders, maritime critical infrastructures, maritime activities and transport, contributing as well to a better performance and cooperation on coast guard functions. Research and innovation in the area of maritime security will also support the development of future capabilities for the protection of sea harbours and related sea lines of communication including entry/exit routes. The objective of maritime security research activities in this regard covers prevention, preparedness and response to expected and unexpected events including anthropogenic and natural disasters, accidents, climate change as well as threats such as terrorism and piracy, cyber, hybrid and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) ones. The EU Maritime Security Research Agenda lays down in this regard specific areas to address, including cybersecurity, interoperability and information sharing, autonomous systems, networking and communication systems and multi-purpose platforms. Specific EU maritime security legislation[[Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security, Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on enhancing port security.]] also emphasises maritime passenger transport, and the threats to passengers. Innovative and more efficient capabilities for the security of maritime passenger transport could therefore also be a useful area of research.</p><p>Regarding security in the movements of goods across external borders, research will address requirements identified by the European Commission and EU customs authorities and should contribute to capabilities for detecting illegal activities both at external border crossing points and through the supply chain. EU customs authorities face increasing volumes of commerce, trade and traffic of goods, as well as having a range of tasks to fulfil besides security. International smuggling has the potential to become more sophisticated and/or increase in the coming years and decades, and could be facilitated by cybercrime. Criminal networks may exploit potential weaknesses of global supply chains, transport and logistics to pursue illicit trade and other crimes. At the same time, threats and hazards that may need to be detected in the flow of goods are very diverse and often need different sensors and technologies to be detected (from chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological and explosive material to drugs, firearms, money, waste, trafficked wildlife, cultural goods, etc.). Hence, customs need innovation to enable detection and to ensure security without at the same time disrupting or unnecessarily hampering trade flows. Capabilities built through research will contribute to the implementation of the EU Customs Union action plan to reinforce customs risk management and effective controls. Capabilities include those on threat detection; automated controls and detection that reduce the need to open or stop containers, packages, baggage or cargo; decision support; portability of control solutions; and technologies to track cross-border illicit trade.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this Destination, additional eligibility conditions have been defined with regard to the active involvement of relevant security practitioners or end-users.</p><p>Successful proposals under this Destination are invited to cooperate with other EC-chaired or funded initiatives in the relevant domains, such as the Networks of Practitioners projects funded under H2020 Secure Societies work programmes, the Knowledge Networks for Security Research &amp;

In particular, it is essential for Member States' armed forces to provide combat units with increased engagement capabilities without being spotted and with a high level of success and survivability.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) engagement is the capability of firing at a target not directly seen by the effector, based on information given by a remote sensor. The Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) capability offers tactical advantages, as mobile units acquire an increased engagement capability with higher kill probability and without being spotted by the adversary.</p><p>To succeed in a BLOS-firing mission, reconnaissance, intelligence, and adequate preparations is likely essential. A technical system design (i.e., incorporating command and control, mobility, survivability, lethality, intelligence and endurance) for BLOS must be versatile against future alterations pending an evolving hostile threat. A BLOS system design therefore needs to be future-proof regarding robustness and security to motivate investments in resources and funds for the anticipated period of life.</p><p>In this context, some requirements are becoming increasingly important: provide the land and coastal combat units with an increased engagement capability and with a very high degree of success and survivability; discriminate between threats that are not always clearly identified and visible before firing; defeat targets that may mask or unmask at the last moment; avoid widespread collateral damage; providing conditions for a high level of survivability by low exposure as well as reachability with precision strikes over an area.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address:</p><ul><li>the development of innovative technologies of interest to improve the performance of the capability;</li><li>the update of BLOS collaborative close combat architecture for the integration of new technologies / capabilities;</li><li>the development of effect management functions for BLOS capability;</li><li>the development or the integration of a BLOS battlefield training system for collaborative training indoor, outdoor and being able to use force on force;</li><li>the development of a common interface concept for dismounted system integration in light and medium vehicles and system compatibility with, but not limited to, ring mounted version;</li><li>the demonstration of a BLOS collaborative engagement that: <ul><li>should include firing from a dismounted version (possibly mounted on a light vehicle);</li><li>may include firing from a BLOS system integrated into a battlefield vehicle (deployed in a tactical situation).</li> </ul></li></ul><p><strong><em>Types of

This type of battlefield, previously purely oil-based from cradle to grave, to integrate energy management technologies, buffer storage resources and a camp/weapon system interface in a constrained and contested tactical environment, is in need of a comprehensive review of its energy production and distribution. It requires the implementation of a coherent and efficient energy network, from the energy production systems at operational level to the soldiers at tactical level, through all the layers of the distribution systems.</p><p>In parallel, the EU defence sector has to start its digital and green energy transition to contribute to the EU net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050 and to anticipate growing energy costs linked to the vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies becoming increasingly scarce and disputed.</p><p>This development entails major risks for military activities. The multiplication of low-carbon energy sources and the risk of more complex logistics are an additional challenge for manoeuvres. It is also an opportunity to meet the growing demand for future weapons systems, platforms and devices.</p><p>An energy-independent and energy efficient deployable military camp, as part of the future electric battlefield, is the first step towards an operational and tactical integrated energy supply chain. It serves as a starting point, hub for innovative electric energy generation and efficient distribution throughout all levels. This includes initial definitions of interface between the stationary components (operational level) and the mobile components (tactical level) of the electric battlefield.</p><p>As the role of the military camps, as an energy provider has been emphasised, scaling-up of its technological bricks (energy generation, storage and distribution) needs to be amplified while covering a wide range of operational scenarios.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>The specific objective of this topic is to substitute the fossil fuel dependency reduction in military deployable camps (support and mobility) without any drop of operational performances, in a context of increasing electrical energy demand in the battlefield. Moreover, investigation on the return of experience of the demonstration stage, should include specifications of a whole concept of energy independent and efficient deployable camps. Furthermore, the ability to support the diminution of their fossil fuel consumptions while maintaining operational performances, avoiding logistics, security burden and reducing logistics footprint should be validated.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address a full-scale operational demonstrator of a deployable camp fulfilling interoperability between inter-allied armies and NATO, with a modular and easily deployable energy system and adaptable energy mix.</p><p>Proposals must pursue the feasibility study of different technologies to answer to the identified needs of the Member States and EDF Associated Countries while ensuring the interoperability of systems and taking into consideration opportunities such as autonomy or resilience. As innovative solutions evolve rapidly, the proposals should update results generated through the latest research in this domain. In addition, proposals should demonstrate the effectiveness of logistics and maintenance in different scenarios (e.g., Host Nation Support, Contractor Support to Operations or by military themselves).</p><p>Proposals must design and produce the solutions (production, storage and management modules, including control and command interfaces, communication protocols, and operational simulation and planning systems). In order to ensure their safe use, functional tests must be performed before the demonstration stage.</p><p>Proposals must address physical experiment of the most critical technological modules deployed in military camps, especially the most vulnerable ones toward harsh environmental conditions and demanding operational scenarios, including resilience against electronic warfare, cyber-attacks and electromagnetic pulse.</p><p>Proposals must split the demonstration of the technological modules in different locations hosted by several Member States in different representative environment (cold/warm weather, dust, number of occupants, deployment duration, type of mission, etc.). In addition, the proposals must validate a wide range of operational use cases and assess the adaptability of the technology for the deployment in different scenarios. Adding up, they should ensure testing, validation and qualification of the overall concept through simulation activities in real military context including in harsh conditions. Furthermore, the ability of the energy architectures and protocols endorsed to operate in civil-based (non-rugged) solutions should be demonstrated. The demonstration should cover the simulation and planning tools.</p><p>The focus must be on military use-cases, taking into account specific harsh military environment (cold/heat/dust), different deployments and conflict intensities (including the shift from low-intensity conflict to high-intensity warfare), different deployed infrastructures, different life-time phases of the camp (storage, building, operation and redeployment phase) and military heavy constraints (logistic, maintenance, training, risk management, unmanned).</p><p><strong><em>Types of activities</em></strong></p><p>The following table lists the types of activities which are eligible for this topic, and whether they are mandatory or optional <em>(see Article 10(3) EDF Regulation)</em>:</p><table> <thead> <tr> <td><p><strong>Types of activities</strong></p><p>(art 10(3) EDF Regulation)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Eligible?</strong></p></td> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><p>(a)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to create, underpin and improve knowledge, products and technologies<em>, </em>including disruptive technologies, which can achieve significant effects in the area of defence (<strong>generating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>No</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(b)</p></td> <td><p>Activities that aim to increase interoperability and resilience, including secured production and exchange of data, to master critical defence technologies, to strengthen the security of supply or to enable the effective exploitation of results for defence products and technologies (<strong>integrating knowledge</strong>)</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(c)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Studies</strong>, such as feasibility studies to explore the feasibility of new or upgraded products, technologies, processes, services and solutions</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(d)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Design</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology as well as the definition of the technical specifications on which such a design has been developed, including any partial test for risk reduction in an industrial or representative environment</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(e)</p></td> <td><p><strong>System prototyping</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(f)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Testing</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(g)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Qualification</strong> of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(mandatory)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(h)</p></td> <td><p><strong>Certification </strong>of a defence product, tangible or intangible component or technology</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>(i)</p></td> <td><p>Development of technologies or assets <strong>increasing efficiency</strong> across the life cycle of defence products and technologies</p></td> <td><p>Yes(optional)</p></td> </tr> </tbody></table><p>Accordingly, the proposals must cover at least the following tasks as part of mandatory activities:</p><ul><li>Studies: <ul><li>Study activities must build on ongoing, completed civil-based and military research and follow as well new solutions available on the market (hydrogen/synthetic fuels, non-fossil fuels from renewable sources, smart grid, microgrids, self-healing power systems, etc.) to validate the feasibility of deploying such solutions in operations areas.

As with all such systems, there is a lack of key requirements and an overall development and sustainability frameworks that meets the real needs of defence users at the tactical level in the EU Member States and EDF Associated Countries. It should be noted, however, that large UAS are always challenging to operate due to their specific needs, e.g., regarding facilities, maintenance and support.</p><p>Anticipated advances in miniaturisation and communication protocols are likely to provide sufficient ground for improvements in the area of small UAS for defence applications and their associated payloads, including weapons, without the stringent need for large UAS. Such activities are embedded in very promising prospects for further industrial and operational development.</p><p>Against this background, this topic aims to have a direct impact on the tactical operational effectiveness of armed forces in multi-domain operations (air, land and maritime). In addition, the outcome of this topic is also expected to improve the intervention capacity of relevant national or European agencies.</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>In

Architecture (IMOSA) approach to allow interchangeability of components and interoperability between different solutions, including a 'plug and play? capability for sensors and possible effectors.</p><p>As the small UAS cannot support sets of different sensors due to weight, space and power limitations, the possibility of standard interfaces should be explored to allow the selection and integration of a variety of specific sensors to be used in different configurations depending on the mission, and to facilitate the use in defence, civil and dual-use configurations.</p><p>In

EDF-2024-DA-SPACE-EPW-STEP,Secure waveform for satellite communications,EDF-DA EDF Development Actions,EDF Action Grant Budget-Based,single-stage,2024-06-19T22:00:00,2024-11-04T23:00:00,,25000000,25000000,,46905574,46905526TOPICSen,"<span>Objective</span>:<p>In today's military applications supported by satellite communications, security, information assurance and link efficiency are inextricably linked. Military operations are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms. At the same time, security threats are becoming more apparent, raising concerns that nations, terrorist groups, criminals and individual hackers can jam, interrupt and endanger military operations.</p><p>In satellite communications, most individual nations cannot generate significant capabilities by themselves. Instead, European nations can generate increased capabilities through cooperation and collaboration. Several pooling and sharing initiatives have already been kicked off in the European defence context to face challenges related to the fragmentation of supply and demand, the assured secure access to satellite communications and the changing environment.</p><p>The complexity of dispersed military operations translates into requirements to have access to complex global satellite communication networks with a mix of different satellite constellations, networks and services to support a wide variety of military applications. Security and resilience are key features of today's military satellite networks and are paired with efficiency to cope with the increased data demand of bandwidth hungry services such as ISR and situational awareness, the growing use of on-the-move applications, and the need for seamless end-user experience during operations. However, military satellite communication networks with these wide-ranging requirements face an increased risk of ill-intentioned acts and cyber-attacks such as jamming, signal spoofing and interception attempts.</p><p>A key element to tackle this security challenge is the implementation of a protected, resilient and secure satellite communication waveform for fully transparent, processed transparent and the new generation processed interactive transponders, which at the same time responds to the operational requirements and allows for interoperability during joint operations with allies.</p><p>The great majority of Member States do not have independent access to secure satellite communication waveforms, although they also engage in military operations in a national or multinational (EU, NATO, UN peacekeeping, etc.) context. The investment for developing a protected waveform cannot be carried out by a single nation alone and requires a multinational development approach in a European context with the aim to establish a European Protected Waveform (EPW).</p><p><strong><em>Specific objective</em></strong></p><p>This topic aims specifically at further developing a European interoperable protected waveform for satellite military communications that can be used by different EU nations individually or together in a joint operational context (EU, NATO, multi-nation missions). Such European Protected Waveform (EPW) should in particular target efficiency, security, affordability and interoperability of satellite communications. The EPW should be license-based and flexibly adapted according to the application, service or platform (fixed, on-the-move or on-the-pause) during peacetime or in operations.</p><p>Next to the waveform, related technologies should be developed to increase the security and resilience (via integrated multi-layered approach) and adopt the EPW on on-board processing satellites as well as to cater for next-generation technologies.</p><p>The targeted development should therefore be undertaken with five key considerations in mind:</p><p><u>1/ European autonomy and cooperation between Member States </u></p><p>The EPW should be capable of increasing the autonomy of Europe and of reducing the dependence on non-European satellite communication technologies for military operations with mission critical and sensitive information. At the same time, it should allow for interoperability between EU nations in a joint operational context to support the exchange of mission critical information and improve the efficiency of the operations.</p><p><u>2/ Affordable and efficient satellite services </u></p><p>The EPW should be affordable and include the latest efficiency satellite communication waveform, networking and equipment technologies to save OPEX (reduce bandwidth costs, require less resources for planning) and CAPEX (reduce equipment cost) compared to current existing expensive (proprietary) military satellite modems. The EPW should include already available innovative Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) satellite communication technologies (e.g., DVB-S2X waveform standard) in combination with the latest security and resilience technologies. There should no longer be a trade-off between the efficiency of the waveform and security. As such, high throughput demands should be achieved even with small satellite terminals using a limited amount of satellite bandwidth.</p><p><u>3/ Flexibility and scalability </u></p><p>The EPW should be portable on different modems with different form factors (board, modem, terminal), different platforms (fixed, on-the-move, on-the-pause) and be used across multiple types of satellite communication networks, different types of satellite constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, HEO, high-throughput satellites, spot beams, regional and global beams), transponders (fully transparent-, processed transparent- and processed interactive, including software defined radio ones) and different network architectures (VSAT, point-to-point, mesh). At the same time, the EPW should be operational in different satellite frequency bands (at least C-band, X-band, Ku-band and Ka-band) and exchange, broadcast, multicast, unicast or relay a large range of satellite services and applications, including those requiring low latency, from low to very high data rates.</p><p><u>4/ Innovation </u></p><p>The EPW development should not just be a copy and paste of existing waveform solutions, licenses and technologies. The EPW proposal should be ambitious and innovative, combining the individual strengths of different nations and different members in the European satellite communication industry. The EPW programme should be open to support future requirements and capabilities needed.</p><p><u>5/ Security and resilience </u></p><p>The main feature of the EPW should be the increase in protection and resilience of the waveform to ensure secure information exchange over satellite for mission critical communications. Based on different threat analysis and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) definitions, the EPW development should focus on building satellite links that are resistant to electronic- and cyber-attacks, such as jamming, signal spoofing, eavesdropping and interception attempts. In addition, satellite link outages caused by rain fade, atmospheric and extra-atmospheric (relevant space weather events) conditions, or on-the-move communication challenges should be reduced to a minimum. The EPW activity should investigate how different security levels can be offered towards different military end users depending on their security requirements, their daily operations and the budgets available.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Proposals must address system prototyping of the baseband equipment (satellite modem), the on-board satellite active transponder and ancillary systems, as well as the testing of all prototypes (modems, on board active transponders and ancillary systems) operating the EPW in a controlled and operational military environment.</p><p><strong><em>Types of

Current ways of planning, designing and building often overlook the importance of continuously engaging end-users or local communities. Yet, incorporating community knowledge and efforts can lead to more liveable neighbourhoods that reflect local needs and contexts and empower current and future residents. Moreover, the way public spaces are designed can have an important impact on the way people interact with each other, the kind of activities that take place in such spaces, and the trust of people towards their local authority and thus democracy. Therefore, it is key to empower people to take an active role in co-designing those spaces. This can lead to greater acceptance, enhanced sense of belonging, social trust and an increased willingness to further engage with the community, and thus promote a global positive social impact on people's well-being and the neighbourhood as a whole.</p><p>Building on work carried out in previous projects, proposals will study, refine and validate existing engagement approaches, that allow residents, businesses, cultural organisations and local governments to co-design and co-create public spaces in neighbourhoods. For instance, this should include how to involve citizens in the development and maintenance of public spaces and neighbourhoods; or flexible designs allowing communities to re-create or re-furbish spaces according to evolving needs. Special attention should be paid to involve diverse groups and citizens at risk of exclusion.</p><p>Proposals are expected to address all of the following:</p><ul><li>Study and refine engagement model(s) and methodology(ies) that enables the meaningful participation of concerned stakeholders and citizens in the co-design, refurbishment and development of public spaces in their neighbourhoods. The model and methodology should: <ul><li>Be inclusive and accessible, and ensure that citizens are empowered to contribute to the decision-making processes;</li><li>Use innovative digital tools, platforms and technologies such as augmented reality or virtual reality, to facilitate virtual and physical collaboration between citizens, designers, urban planners, policymakers and the construction ecosystem to enhance citizen engagement in the planning, design and construction process while ensuring that digital solutions remain inclusive and accessible, and assessing their added value compared to 'traditional' in-person methods.</li> </ul></li><li>Demonstrate that the chosen engagement approach(es) (e.g. model, methodology, digital tools) can effectively and measurably foster openness, social cohesion, trust and acceptance within communities as well as promote the inclusion of marginalised communities and/or vulnerable groups in public space redevelopment projects. Proposals should demonstrate this in at least three neighbourhoods with differing local environmental, social and economic conditions, and each one located in a different Member State or Associated Country.</li><li>Monitor and evaluate all stages of the chosen engagement approach(es), using an appropriate methodology, and measure the success of projects in fostering openness, social cohesion, acceptance within communities as well as the inclusion of marginalised communities and vulnerable groups.</li><li>Assess how the above may impact future project design and decision-making in the construction of neighbourhoods as well as in the construction ecosystem.</li></ul><p>Cross-sectoral and cross-disciplinary collaboration between architects, engineers, designers, creative sectors, natural and social scientists, urban planners, environmentalists, and by extension the broader cultural and creative sector is encouraged. The involvement of relevant stakeholders such as local small organizations, communities' representatives, end-users, and local authorities in the design and implementation of the project is also encouraged.</p><p>Actions are strongly recommended to collaborate with and build on the work of relevant research.

It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.</p><p>The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7"">https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7</a>).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).</p><p>At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20180612-1"">Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)</a>]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.</p><p>There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[<sup></sup>https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].</p><p>On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'</p><p>Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.</p><p>The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.</p><p>First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (<u>https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf</u>). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://craft-cities.eu/"">https://craft-cities.eu/</a>)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.</p><p>Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1603122220757&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0662"">COM(2020) 662 final</a>]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.</p><p>Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.</p><p>All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.</p><p>By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent?, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/whats-new/newsroom/06-12-2023-geography-of-discontent-regional-development-traps-lead-to-less-support-for-european-integration-and-values_en"">'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe'</a>]]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.</p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:</p><ul><li><strong>The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular</strong> through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.</li><li><strong>The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased</strong> through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.</li><li><strong>Innovative funding and financing models </strong>are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.</li><li>Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by <strong>the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector</strong>. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions.</li></ul><p>These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.</p><p>R&amp;I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Covenant of Mayors and past and ongoing relevant projects funded by Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, such as STARTS, as well as with other EU programmes such as LIFE-CET, LIFE-Circular Economy, URBACT, Green City Accord and European Green Capital/Leaf awards.</p>",,,

It also strives to shift to a circular economy, work towards its zero-pollution ambition, and to protect and restore biodiversity, in line with the European Green Deal goals. The New European Bauhaus (NEB) has been a part of this agenda for the past three years. It is contributing to reducing GHG emissions and embedding circular economy principles in several strategic areas, including the built environment. It is also leveraging the power of culture, art and creativity for the green transition.</p><p>The built environment is a central part of our daily lives. On average, Europeans spend 85 to 90% of their time in buildings. Overall, buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's total energy consumption and for 36% of its GHG emissions from energy, as well as for a large share of air pollutant emissions[[Over 60% of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions come from the residential, commercial and institutional sector (see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7"">https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/dashboards/necd-directive-data-viewer-7</a>).]]. Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).</p><p>At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20180612-1"">Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)</a>]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.</p><p>There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[<sup></sup>https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].</p><p>On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'</p><p>Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.</p><p>The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.</p><p>First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (<u>https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf</u>). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://craft-cities.eu/"">https://craft-cities.eu/</a>)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.</p><p>Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1603122220757&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0662"">COM(2020) 662 final</a>]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places.

Half of all extracted materials end up in the construction sector, while construction and demolition waste accounts for more than a third of all water consumption and waste generated in the EU. Spatial planning also affects transport distances to access buildings and can thus impact the amount of noise and GHG emissions from transport. Buildings also have significant impacts on nature and biodiversity. Urbanisation and construction often lead to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting ecosystems and displacing wildlife, resulting in biodiversity loss. Moreover, pollution and light emanating from buildings can also affect and disturb wildlife. Furthermore, the built environment needs to be made more resilient against natural (climate-extreme events; pandemics) and man-made hazards (cyber threats; terrorism).</p><p>At the same time, innovation in the construction sector spreads slowly. Renovations are still too expensive, too slow, and often of insufficient quality, resulting in renovation rates that are too low. The roll-out of heating and cooling decarbonisation is also progressing at an insufficient pace. And buildings are inefficiently used - 38% of buildings in the EU (28) are under occupied, with a rate higher than 60% in four, and higher than 50% in seven Member States[[Eurostat (2018), <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/DDN-20180612-1"">Overcrowded and under-occupied dwellings - Products Eurostat News - Eurostat (europa.eu)</a>]]. Design for adaptability to changing household sizes, for shared facilities and for multiple use can help use available buildings more efficiently, thus reducing the need for new construction.</p><p>There is also a lack of awareness of circular and innovative approaches amongst the different actors of the construction sector, and it is challenging for public institutions to widely apply more sustainable and climate-resilient practices, in line with the EU Adaptation Strategy[[COM(2021) 82 final]]. There are not enough incentives for such practices, in a market that remains very attached to low costs in the short term. Consequently, sustainable, circular and innovative construction materials and design solutions are rarely widely available, accessible or affordable. Yet, circular economy approaches could lead to reductions of waste and of up to 60 % in the materials-related GHG emitted[[<sup></sup>https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through/cutting-greenhouse-gas-emissions-through]].</p><p>On the supply-side, the EU Emissions Trading System carbon price and carbon cap, combined with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, will lead to a strong reduction of the embodied carbon in key construction materials. And on the demand side, designs and construction of buildings with very low life cycle GHG emissions, including through sustainably sourced materials that store carbon during the life span of the building, can make a strong contribution to reaching EU-wide climate neutrality[[The EU's 2050 Roadmap for whole life carbon of buildings is planned for the first quarter of 2024.]]. As the built environment is an integral part of people's daily lives, this reality affects many citizens who live in buildings that may be old, non-resilient, non-sustainable, polluting (e.g. due to outdated solid fuel (coal, wood) heating), and excessively energy and resource consuming, with consequences on the health and well-being of occupants and others. This affects particularly the less wealthy, especially in absence of targeted public support to restore buildings. The built environment thus has a huge potential when it comes to the reduction of GHG and air pollutant emissions, saving of resources, sufficiency[[The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines sufficiency as 'a set of measures and daily practices that avoid demand for energy, materials, land, and water while delivering human well-being for all within planetary boundaries.'</p><p>Sufficiency interventions in buildings include the optimisation of the use of building space, repurposing unused existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of households.]], climate adaptation, disaster resilience, and improved health and well-being. This while also embedding culture and arts in the solutions being developed. Last but not least, the transformation of our built environment should address questions of affordability, power and responsibility: the determining factor for many households is the short-term economic cost of the transition.</p><p>The Destination New European Bauhaus would operate at the level of neighbourhoods and communities for three reasons.</p><p>First of all, because some results can immediately be implemented, seen and felt at the neighbourhood and community level. Neighbourhoods are understood here as the comprehensive residential systems, in rural, peri-urban or urban areas, where people live, socialize, and find services to meet some - or most - of their daily needs. Neighbourhoods offer a territorial fragment, a community at the level of which different policy areas can be merged using a holistic approach[[The NEB Compass provides guidance on the NEB holistic approach (<u>https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/system/files/2023-01/NEB_Compass_V_4.pdf</u>). A range of EU-funded projects are implementing this approach. For instance, two on-going waves of NEB lighthouse demonstrators are expected to illustrate how the NEB holistic approach can deliver the deep transformation needed to accelerate the green transition on the ground. Other EU-projects are working on operational impact models to support the implementation of NEB principles on the ground (e.g. CrAFt -(<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://craft-cities.eu/"">https://craft-cities.eu/</a>)) as well as for holistic urban planning and for assessing the (co-) benefits of it (e.g. Re-Value (https://re-value-cities.eu/))]]. Solutions to make neighbourhoods more beautiful, inclusive, sustainable, circular, secure and climate resilient can be used as proof of concept and later scaled up or replicated in other contexts. Over the past three years, the NEB has functioned as a living laboratory developing new methods and approaches thanks to research and innovation to drive concrete transformations and accompany both targeted local actions and a wider, radical change of mind-sets.</p><p>Second, in line with the Renovation Wave[[<a target=""_blank"" href=""https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1603122220757&amp;uri=CELEX:52020DC0662"">COM(2020) 662 final</a>]], the NEB reflects the close link between, on the one hand the circularity and renovation of the built environment, and on the other hand, with the social and cultural dimension of places. The way we shape our environment is an expression of culture, cultural heritage, arts, identity and diversity. The NEB takes into consideration those social and cultural dimensions.</p><p>Third, neighbourhoods and communities are the first to feel the quick impact of change and the urgent need for action. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic profoundly changed working, consumption and social habits and, consequently, people's interaction in the built environment. The pandemic also boosted practices of solidarity, reciprocity and cooperation, especially in neighbourhoods with greater social vulnerability. The rise in global temperature levels, increasing frequency and scale of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and droughts, floods, forest fires, and tempests impact and destroy people's homes. At the same time, ageing societies represent a demographic trend that is likely to shape neighbourhood and community patterns in the future. These challenges underscore the need for responsive and adaptive infrastructures that address the new situation and reflect the specificities of the place/territory/community. They also underline the importance of supporting a strong social fabric that helps society to face those challenges and highlight the importance of spaces for sociability and interaction that strengthen community bonds and strategies for coping with emerging challenges. For instance, innovative infrastructure and public spaces should be envisioned to be inclusive of and accessible to people of all ages, commensurate with their specific needs and capacities, including through the integration of technology and smart environments. The need to pay greater attention to the built environment and its social impact and relevance for the community is evident. Yet, there has been scarce research on the new dynamics affecting the relationship between sustainable transformation, the built environment and the society.</p><p>All topics of the Destination New European Bauhaus aim to make the European construction sector more climate friendly and climate-resilient - through circularity and regenerative approaches for sustainability - as well as more competitive while also ensuring that the built environment contributes to restoring natural ecosystems and improving social cohesion, as well as people's health and well-being. By adopting the New European Bauhaus' integrated approach that brings together sustainability, inclusion, and aesthetics through the active participation of citizens and the integration of arts and cultures in transformation processes, the Destination will contribute to developing a new generation of solutions, closer to people and their needs.</p><p>By involving people from diverse backgrounds with different needs through accessible participatory practices, topics will also aim to connect the green transformation with local democracies. This can help restore citizens' solidarity and trust in democracy and avoid a 'geography of discontent?, a phenomenon showing that places stuck in a development trap and where citizens feel left behind are faced with disengagement and discontent in the long term[[For more details, see <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/whats-new/newsroom/06-12-2023-geography-of-discontent-regional-development-traps-lead-to-less-support-for-european-integration-and-values_en"">'The geography of EU discontent and the regional development trap in Europe'</a>]]. This can also contribute to address some of the negative effects of digitalisation on society such as fake news and disinformation.</p><p>Proposals for topics under this Destination should set out a credible pathway contributing to the NEB, and more specifically to one or more of the following impacts:</p><ul><li><strong>The construction ecosystem is more sustainable, less polluting and more circular</strong> through the development of innovative and regenerative designs, architecture, bio-based materials and approaches that are adopted across the construction value chain and included into public and business decision-making. The construction ecosystem also becomes more climate-friendly and climate-resilient through the development of solutions for faster, cheaper and better renovation for zero-emission and energy-positive buildings, for more efficient use of buildings, designs using low-carbon and carbon-storing materials, and solutions. Cutting-edge technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), are integrated and applied with arts, architectural and design sciences at the service of a more regenerative and circular construction ecosystem.</li><li><strong>The trust of citizens in the green transition and democracy is increased</strong> through participatory processes and governance models that balance public and private interests. This is achieved by using insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), social innovation, and by looking at how arts, culture and design can further amplify the transformative potential of those practices and models.</li><li><strong>Innovative funding and financing models </strong>are developed and applied to increase investments in the revitalisation of neighbourhoods. This would involve exploring tailored and innovative funding and financing models that mitigate the perceived risk of solutions for the built environment that combine environmental sustainability (towards climate neutrality, zero pollution and circular economy) with other aspects that increase their acceptance, such as accessibility, affordability, aesthetics and cultural relevance (e.g. identity, cultural heritage, sense of belonging) with the final goal to increase well-being in a cooperative society.</li><li>Wider social acceptance of the green transition and related solutions is supported by <strong>the creation of meaning through the contribution of the creative, arts and cultural heritage sector</strong>. The expertise of stakeholders from the cultural and creative sectors assists companies and policy makers in addressing challenges associated with the green, digital, and social transitions.</li></ul><p>These research components will also be supported by transversal actions to connect them, build synergies, and foster knowledge sharing and learning as well as to support monitoring and evaluation of progress.</p><p>R&amp;I activities under this Destination will complement and ensure synergies with activities supported under several Horizon Europe partnerships, in particular: Built4People, Circular Bio-based Europe and Driving Urban Transition. Synergies will also be ensured with the Horizon Europe Missions, in particular the Climate-neutral and smart cities Mission and the Adaptation to climate change Mission. Opportunities for collaboration and synergies should also be explored and, as appropriate, pursued with other relevant initiatives such as the European Urban Initiative of Cohesion Policy, the Covenant of Mayors and past and ongoing relevant projects funded by Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe, such as STARTS, as well as with other EU programmes such as LIFE-CET, LIFE-Circular Economy, URBACT, Green City Accord and European Green Capital/Leaf awards.</p>",,,

National Coordination Centres can also support priority areas such as the implementation of EU legislation (Directive (EU) 2022/2555, the proposed Cyber Resilience Act38, Cybersecurity Act39). The objective is to support the operation of the NCCs and to enable them to support the cybersecurity community, including SMEs, for the uptake and dissemination of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions and strengthen cybersecurity capacities.</p> <span>Scope</span>:<p>The National Coordination Centre should carry out the following tasks:</p><p>? Acting as contact points at the national level for the Cybersecurity Competence Community to support the EECCC in achieving its objectives and missions;</p><p>? Providing expertise and actively contributing to the strategic tasks of the ECCC, taking into account relevant national and regional challenges for cybersecurity in different sectors;</p><p>?

The funding should foremost facilitate the adoption and widespread use of state-of-the-art cybersecurity solutions. This should equip organisations with the latest and most effective tools and strategies available for cybersecurity, fortifying their overall cybersecurity capabilities, and helping them to become more resilient and better prepared to face the evolving challenges posed by cyber threats in the digital age. Such support should be in synergy with other actions undertaken by NCCs, such as their role as contact point, promotion of participation in cross-border projects and actions, establishing synergies with other activities, and fostering links with the ECCC and other relevant national and European actions such as the Digital Innovation Hubs. This topic targets exclusively National Coordination Centres which have been recognised by the Commission as having the capacity to manage funds to achieve the mission and objectives laid down in the Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and the Network of National Coordination Centres. Indicatively 50% of the grant will be distributed via financial support to third parties. These actions aim at the operation of National Coordination Centres, which occupy a central role in the cybersecurity landscape as foreseen in Regulation (EU) 2021/887. Due to the synergetic role, they play with regards activities at national, regional and local levels, such as addressing cybersecurity in national policies on research, development and innovation in the area of, and in particular in those policies stated in the national cybersecurity strategies, they must be able to handle sensitive information, and be protected against possible dependencies and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity to pre-empt foreign influence and control. As previously noted, participation of non-EU entities entails the risk of highly sensitive information about security infrastructure, risks and incidents being subject to legislation or pressure that obliges those non-EU entities to disclose this information to non-EU governments, with an unpredictable security risk. Therefore, based on the outlined security reasons, the actions relating to SOCs are subject to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EU) 2021/694, in consistency with WP 2021/2022.</p>",,,,,

The COVID-19 pandemic has pointed at several issues (e.g. delivery of essential goods, ensuring uninterrupted and safe public transport operations for essential workers etc.) that need to be addressed to secure future resilience of the transport system and to ensure that the level of transport safety is not only maintained, but also meeting more demanding targets. For instance, the decreased use of public transport during the pandemic has to some extent led to increases in both biking and walking, but also an increased use of cars in some parts of the world. At the same time, decreased traveling has meant fewer vehicles on the roads in certain areas, whereas others have seen an increase of delivery vehicles, as home deliveries have surged. Likewise, the current energy market realities have made even more pressing the need of an energy efficient mobility system that could absorb disruptions in the fuel supply chain.</p><p>Digital tools/services and new transport means (e.g. urban air mobility and micro mobility), new ways how to use the infrastructure (e.g. even more shared spaces with different types of vehicles, both highly automated and manually controlled) in a more energy efficient manner and new behaviour should be included in the research.</p><p>In order to provide safe and resilient transport for all, many aspects are expected to be considered in a clearly multidisciplinary approach. Proposed actions are expected to address at least three out of the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Scenarios of disruptive changes that can make a transport system unstable should be identified, the consequences on transport safety be analysed, and solutions to tackle them developed. This includes safety implications of rapid changes / new incentives (sometimes contradictory to previous ones, e.g. regarding the use of public transport in a pandemic situation).</li><li>Analysis of how socio-economic differences may affect the safety of individuals in case of disruptive changes (e.g. individual mobility options are determined by the socio-economic status).</li><li>Study of how the concept of resilience at the system level can be applied and used for the improvement of transport safety.</li><li>Evaluation of the potential and development of recommendations on how to improve transport safety and resilience through suburban planning and future housing developments with their effects on the demand for transport and through the design of transport infrastructure networks. </li></ul><p>A definition of resilience in the context of transport systems should be provided, and factors of transport safety and energy efficiency that are essential to take into account should be determined. Moreover, scenarios for disruptive changes should be identified that can make a transport system instable, the consequences on transport safety be analysed, and solutions to tackle them be developed. Hence, a structured method to secure safety as an integrated part in resilient transport systems should be provided.</p><p>A solid foundation for this research is the Safe System Approach. It requires the inclusion of relevant expertise in social sciences and humanities (SSH) and will benefit from international cooperation.</p>",,"<p>This Destination includes activities addressing safe and smart mobility services for passengers and goods.</p><p>Europe needs to manage the transformation of supply-based transport into safe, resilient and sustainable transport and demand-driven, smart mobility services for passengers and goods. Suitable research and innovation will enable significant safety, environmental, economic and social benefits by reducing accidents caused by human error, decreasing traffic congestion, reducing energy consumption and emissions of vehicles, increasing efficiency and productivity of freight transport operations. To succeed in this transformation, Europe's ageing (and not always sustainable) transport infrastructure needs to be prepared for enabling cleaner and smarter operations.</p><p>Europe needs also to maintain a high-level of transport safety for its citizens.

Changes can result from the evolution of the CCAM system itself, for example, as a result of increasing connectivity using V2X communication, the use of AI-based systems, and OTA (over-the-air) software updates. The traffic system, in which CCAM systems are being deployed, is changing at a rapid pace as well, with an increased market share of vehicles with higher levels of automation, new (personal) mobility devices and autonomous mobility robots (e.g., for package delivery). </p><p>At the same time, the way CCAM systems interact with humans in traffic is changing. Until full automation in transport is reached, the human driver will keep on playing an essential role. Also, the interaction with other road users will change, supported by technologies that allow a CCAM system to communicate its intentions to other road users. </p><p>As a consequence of these innovations and developments, the safe deployment of CCAM systems needs an extension of the safety validation procedures and certification schemes, taking advanced human-machine interaction and a continuous in-service monitoring approach into account. Due to the many different scenarios and variations that can occur realistically and that consequently need to be tested, it should be possible that a large part of the assessment is performed in a virtual simulation environment. </p><p>The proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: </p><ol> <li>Developing a validation methodology for scenario-based safety assurance of AI-based CCAM functions. Trustworthiness of the AI-algorithms depends on how well the system responds to scenarios in its Operational Design Domain (ODD) - specificity and how it responds in case it ends-up outside its ODD - robustness. Consequently, methods need to be developed on the use of scenarios to describe the ODD of AI-based systems.</li><li>Connectivity. Developing validation procedures for CCAM systems that rely on V2X for safety-critical functions i.e., the inclusion of the connectivity context. Ensuring aspects of reliability, trustworthiness and cyber-security with respect to V2X is essential. The approach to V2X connectivity is technology neutral.</li><li>Continuous Safety Assurance approach. Developing an approach for a continuous safety validation methodology, to monitor the safety state of deployed CCAM systems in operation (real traffic) during its service life, following type approval. Performance metrics for the reliability of the monitored data, including cyber-security aspects, and indicators for the safety state should be proposed. Also needed is the development of requirements for the monitoring system for use in future standardisation, regarding the exchange of data and safety performance indicators with service organisations and authorities.</li><li>Validating the virtual approach. Developing tools that ensure the relevant degree of detail and the appropriate representation of other road users' behaviour (incl. Vulnerable Road Users such as pedestrians and/or bicyclists) in virtual scenario-based testing. This includes methods to deal with perception, localisation, and world modelling errors in the validation procedures.</li><li>Human Machine Interaction. Developing a safety assurance methodology that incorporates the assessment of Human Machine Interaction (both driver-vehicle and vehicle-road user) concepts for higher levels of automation (conformity checks as well as test set-ups with suitable metrics) ensuring safe communication between driver and vehicle and between vehicle and other road users, making Human Machine Interaction inclusive (i.e. in terms of age, mental and physical ability, cultural aspects, etc.). </li></ol><p>Proposed actions are expected to develop recommendations for harmonisation and standardisation and to feed into on-going discussions regarding EU type vehicle approval rules as well as in the framework of the UNECE.</p><p>Actions should be based on the outcomes of previous methodologies developed in HEADSTART, as well as research funded under HORIZON-CL5-2021-D6-01-02.</p><p>Upcoming CCAM projects, in particular in the area of large-scale demonstrations, validation, digital infrastructure and key enabling technologies should be taken into account to ensure compatibility.</p><p>Links should be established with the Mobility Data Space initiatives from Digital Europe, federated data infrastructure projects (Gaia-X, International Data Spaces, Big Data Value - BDV). </p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan and the United States but also with other relevant strategic partners in third countries.</p><p>This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on 'Connected, Cooperative and Automated Mobility' (CCAM).

Interactions with AI-based vehicles are understandable, human-like and reflect human psychological capabilities.</li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>Today's mobility landscape is rapidly changing, as is seen in the recent boom in the detection of advanced and/or complex urban scenarios that add new challenges to the development of CCAM technologies. These novel scenarios are especially emerging with the establishment of new urban traffic regimes and cultures, such as restricted zones, shared zones, and cycle-streets, which need to be taken into account when designing and developing CCAM solutions.</p><p>To integrate and tackle complex traffic scenarios, CCAM technologies will require highly advanced decision-making based on enhanced collective awareness - the stage beyond on-board perception, advancing on e.g. results from projects under CL5-2022-D6-01-05 - incorporating information from multiple sources and including interpretation for the aggregation of this information. Developing collective awareness should take into account the state of the vehicle, the driver and the road user environment. It can also involve the tracking of other road users' behaviour and generating predictions on a short horizon, which can be based on the input from advanced behavioural models, e.g. those developed within CL5-2022-D6-01-03 projects. The integration of these findings will lead to collective awareness for CCAM.</p><p>The use of multiple sources (sensors and sensor fused information, maps, infrastructure, other road users, and localisation systems) and the sharing of the overall situational information and related intentions of the vehicle and that of its direct environment will be an important building block towards collective awareness. Eventually, in future work this can be incorporated in complex, self-organised bottom-up models of collective behaviour based on the change/modelling of individual interactions. Collective awareness should create a larger time window in safety critical situations and generate benefits for the overarching mobility system, which include efficient traffic management and improved traffic flow as it incorporates situation prediction capabilities and environmental benefits (which can eventually include e.g. smart charging strategies).</p><p>AI is a key enabler to bring these increasing amounts of information together, with decision-making enabled both at vehicle level (including safety critical decisions) and at a mobility system level. In order to continue to define the role and limits of AI and of emerging new developments within AI, this topic recommends exploring Hybrid Intelligence (HI) as such a new subset of AI. Hybrid Intelligence is the process of developing and mobilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) to expand on human intelligence and expertise, thereby ensuring human-like control of CCAM operations. Applying an HI approach will allow CCAM technologies to integrate human expertise and intentionality into its decision-making in order to generate meaningful and appropriate actions that are aligned with ethical, legal and societal values. This will be essential to foster user acceptability, trust and adoption, especially when appropriate SSH expertise is included.</p><p>Proposed R&amp;I actions are expected to address all of the following aspects:</p><ol> <li>Methods to establish collective awareness of CCAM applications that are resilient to faulty sources, thereby ensuring safe operations. Guidance for failsafe designs should be developed.</li><li>Methods to embed an HI approach in the entire action chain towards collective awareness (from basic perception to driving functions) to allow for seamless operation and real-time decision-making while enabling human-like control of CCAM applications by combining system and domain knowledge (of the vehicle and its technologies on one hand and of the transport environment including all the human interactions on the other, thereby understanding of potential risks and capabilities and needs of other road users). Tooling will be required to deliver situational awareness information in a structured way, based on multiple sources and in real-time.

Within large complex vessels, system of systems approaches are used together with Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence approaches to integrate diverse systems ranging from sensors, business and cargo management systems, power and engine management, electronic navigation and situational awareness. System integration of systems with proprietary digital control systems has become more and more critical in terms of ensuring safety and efficiency. The complexity and foundation upon software, makes assurance of the resilience of such systems challenging and requires a different to that applied to hardware- based systems. Waterborne digital system can be vulnerable to both malicious intervention and the consequences of system failure. Examples have included the spoofing of navigational GPS signals, ransom wear attacks on integrated container management systems, complete power shutdown and the helicopter evacuation of a large passenger ship when engine protection systems identified a common fault across all engine waterborne systems. The challenge to assure the safety and resilience of digital systems is particularly important within large complex vessels where the level of integration and connectivity is high and where the consequences of failure can be particularly severe.</p><p>In the domain of power generation and management the vastness of new technological solutions, often driven by environmental regulations, poses new challenges in ships' design and management, where the need for integration of diverse energy converters (ICEs, batteries, fuel cells, wind, capacitors, etc.) confront designers and operators with systems based on profoundly different operating principles coming together with different requirements and control and digital systems. Integration for harnessing the full potential in a safe and secure frame is key to their implementation.</p><p>Furthermore, the capability of integrating different systems (and their dynamics) involve an always increased number of sensors, whose data, fused, should become available for optimisation and increased awareness during normal and safe critical operations.</p><p>Comprehensive HAZOP (Hazard Operability) studies are essential for such vessels, yet the methodologies are poorly established within the waterborne sector whilst other sectors operating safety critical digital systems (aerospace, nuclear, medical automotive etc.) have well established practices. Furthermore, applying 'hardware in the loop? to simulation and validation of digital systems in dependent on the quality of the digital simulation model. This can be difficult for waterborne transport due to the variability of ship designs, complexity and lack of relevant data concerning the integrated components. Pre-delivery testing and sea trials could include fault simulation and digital testing founded upon the identification of critical digital systems identified by the HAZOP, yet such trials focus on hard-ware or subsystems such as rudder control rather than addressing the entire integration. For safety critical systems, reliability regimes need to be established to identify the safe default state in case of system failure or the identification of malicious intervention. In this respect the best system state could be: 'fail operational?, 'fail soft?, 'fail safe?, 'fail secure?, 'fail passive?, 'be fault tolerant?.</p><p>Activities will address the development of a HAZOP methodology for whole system assessment of highly digitised, connected complex vessels. The methodology should include system, system of systems designed for specific function or sets of functions and/or a methodology for the entire vessel, including when application of artificial intelligence algorithms is foreseen. The methodology will be developed with relevant stakeholders including shipbuilders, system designers and equipment providers, IT professionals, operators, class societies, regulators. The acceptability of the methodology to all stakeholders will be assessed and an implementation roadmap will be developed to account for any identified barriers. Work will draw upon the expertise of other sectors with more developed procedures for the assessment and assurance of digital safety.</p><p>On-board systems and functions integration by design, for safe and secure operation should be used to test and demonstrate the safety and security of the applications.</p><p>The developed methodology will be applied to a representative complex highly digitised vessel, safety critical systems and functions will be identified, and appropriate reliability regimes and mitigation measures will be established with consideration of both malicious intervention and system failure.</p><p>Cost effective methodologies for validating the safety, resilience and correct functioning of digital and connected safety critical ship systems, including system of systems, will be developed and demonstrated.</p><ul><li>In case of validation on the basis of a theoretical digital models and/or digital twinning (e.g. hardware in the loop) then the validity of the model should be proven as well as its flexibility to be applied towards a range of vessel designs.</li><li>In case of validation on the basis of physical testing of the responses of the final system to a range of fault conditions and malicious interventions during the final trials, there should be assurance that test conditions are representative of the identified risks. </li></ul><p>Guidance should be produced and disseminated concerning the recommended methodology for assuring the safety and resilience of complex digitalised and connected shipping.</p><p>The safety assessment should be developed by using methodologies suitable for being assessed in international fora such as the International Maritime Organisation.</p> <span>Specific Topic Conditions</span>:<p><p>Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5-6 by the end of the project - see General Annex B.</p></p>",,"<p>This Destination includes activities addressing safe and smart mobility services for passengers and goods.</p><p>Europe needs to manage the transformation of supply-based transport into safe, resilient and sustainable transport and demand-driven, smart mobility services for passengers and goods.

Facilitation of a shift to increase efficiency in road safety related public spending across Europe together with a shift towards more energy efficient mobility choices.</li><li>Development and evaluation of strategies to transform the traffic safety culture of road users and stakeholders based on a valid model that identifies the key components defining traffic safety culture, including, for example, social norms, attitudes, perceived control, values, and system assumptions (including its energy efficiency and consumption)</li><li>Concepts and guidelines to make the concept of traffic safety culture an integral part of road safety work of actors across the socio-economic systems of European societies</li><li>Better understanding of the link between road safety outcomes and safety culture; pilot implementation of road safety education at secondary school level and also for decision makers and practitioners in EU Member States/Associated countries. </li></ul> <span>Scope</span>:<p>A Safe System entails the understanding and managing of all elements of the transport system, including the behaviour and interplay of its actors. Comparative analysis shows persistent differences in road safety performances between EU Member States/Associated countries. These differences may be attributable to differences in culture, which are hard to explain with classical risk models. Efforts should therefore be made to complement road safety initiatives by a <em>safety culture </em>perspective, i.e., the values, beliefs, priorities and viewpoints shared among groups of road users and stakeholders that influence their decisions to behave or act in ways that affect safety, while also considering energy consumption. This concept is already well established in organisational research.</p><p>Assessing road safety cultures in different national, regional or local systems, groups and organisations is believed to help understanding and explaining different patterns of risk perception and risk taking across communities and countries - and can likewise inform tailored interventions for these (sub-)cultures, which all come with their specific norms, values, beliefs and behaviours (including gender-related behavioural patterns). These interventions should address all relevant actors in the system for road transport of people and goods, and consider future developments, such as potential impacts by increasing automation levels or by the introduction of new means of road transport such as e-scooters and hoverboards.</p><p>Within this context, actions should contribute to establishing a framework for cultural transformation in road safety across the EU and thereby address all the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Better understanding of the link between road safety outcomes and safety culture, i.e. of sociocultural factors like values, beliefs, attitudes, and norms and their effects on actual behaviour of road users (including subjective perception of safety as well as implications of value of time and institutionalised travel costs) - and the ways how these factors can be sustainably transformed.</li><li>Consideration in particular - but not exclusively - of traffic behaviour with high safety impacts, such as inadequate speed choice, distraction by communication or control devices, driving or riding under the influence of alcohol or drugs, non-use of protective devices, and risks triggered by professional drivers' requirements to multitask and report while driving.</li><li>Assessment of safety cultures and respective activities from other transport modes such as aviation and rail and their potential for road safety.</li><li>Assessment of the interplay between shifting to more energy efficient mobility solutions and traffic safety.</li><li>Consideration of safety impacts of new technologies (including better understanding and use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)) and emerging transport means and services.</li><li>Consideration of the safety impact of the increasing penetration of urban micro-mobility systems in mixed traffic scenarios and evaluation of potential safety improvements for the protection of micro-mobility users.</li><li>Stocktaking of good practices from countries and companies worldwide already successfully applying cultural approaches to (road) safety work, including countries outside of the EU such as the US and Australia.</li><li>Targeting all levels of the socio-economic systems of societies in the EU, i.e. from European to national, regional and local communities, including entities such as schools and workplaces. Also, NGOs, victims' organisations etc. can play an important role in that regard.</li><li>Clear guidance &amp; hands-on advice on the design and evaluation of interventions to define, measure, transform and institutionalise traffic safety culture across all areas affecting road safety - for decision-makers and practitioners, with a good geographic coverage across EU institutions, EU Member States/Associated countries. At the level of individual road users, including VRUs, such interventions may entail targeted educational and communication efforts to challenge wrong beliefs or to clarify misperceived social norms, and the use of incentives and nudging to encourage compliant behaviour. At the level of enterprises and authorities, initiatives may include the take-up of safety culture principles in sustainability reporting and encompass various activities from staff training and supervision to procurement and operations - at best permeating work culture and norms of an organisation. Advice at the level of EU Member States/Associated countries and the EU is sought on how to support such transformation such as with legislation, enforcement, and data.</li><li>At least three different pilot tests of selected interventions at various levels in different EU Member States/Associated countries. </li></ul><p>Actions should be based on the results of previous research projects in this domain, such as the TraSaCu project, and make advances by completing and updating their theoretical foundations, teaming up with EU stakeholders and bringing their findings to life by establishing a framework for true cultural transformation in road safety both among stakeholders and road users. Making use of data that is already being collected in EU Member States/Associated countries about traffic safety culture such as the ESRA initiative (which already involves 60 countries, including over 20 European ones) and Baseline project is strongly encouraged.</p><p>Special attention should be given to EU countries with lower safety performance.

It is therefore important to study how policies and regulations could be best used to govern transport and mobility systems in desired directions, so that they become more sustainable and just, for instance with regard to gender, place, or low-income households, as well as their fiscal impacts.</p><p>In addition, the COVID-19 crisis has significantly altered commuting habits; remote and telework have become widespread together with other flexible work arrangements. The true impact of these changes on gas emissions and on the well-being of people as well as on the real-estate market (offices) are not known. This is now an opportunity to leverage on an ongoing change in habits that could result in significant GHG reduction.</p><p>Proposals should address all of the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Analyse the influence of politicians on the making of sustainable and non-sustainable transport policies, as well as the impact of their design on accessibility in peripheral areas, identifying synergies with the reform of governance instruments of the European Union (e.g. Trans-European Transport Network, Urban Mobility Framework) to enhance the gradual phase-out policy effect for private car ownership.</li><li>Propose approaches that better integrate mobility policies with policies from other sectors (e.g. energy efficiency, renewables, gender mainstreaming, healthcare, retail and poverty and low income population reduction).</li><li>Consider the benefits of public/private partnerships towards future transport and mobility system, as to secure local adjustment and solutions that are effective and economic for private stakeholders, with a long-term sustainable horizon for the society.</li><li>Identify and assess the potential of (shared) mobility hubs at neighbourhood-level and define the role of organisational innovations in supporting them.</li><li>Explore how small, medium cities and metropolitan areas manage the emergence of micro-mobility and how driverless vehicles are likely to affect urban areas and land use (e.g. mixed use of urban space, dynamic parking).</li><li>Identify the major flaws on national transport and mobility regulations in EU countries and provide recommendations on how to better harmonize them trans-nationally (e.g. incentives for putting bicycles on trains etc.).</li><li>Identify regulations and accountability measures to ensure that mobility data are best utilised for the common good, for example, harnessing the potential of data to stimulate innovation for more sustainable mobility behaviour patterns and guide urban planning, while also protecting citizen privacy.</li><li>Analyse the drivers for public acceptability of stringent and mandatory transport policies (e.g. carbon taxes, urban traffic bans).</li><li>Examine the most effective strategies in promoting the transition to more sustainable freight transport in Europe following the recent and ongoing changes in consumer culture, such as the increase in e-commerce and online.</li></ul><p>A 'social optimum' balance should be included to developing research knowledge within new governance models from several perspectives (e.g. socio-economic, environmental, health, accessibility, gender and inclusion, safety and security aspects). Synergies with the projects GECKO, ACCTING and SHARED GREEN DEAL should be explored, given that mobility behaviours and the role of cities as agent of change will influence policy makers in enabling adaptive and anticipatory regulatory schemes and governance with novel policies contributing to sustainable mobility goals.</p><p>In addition to the research activities, actions are expected to involve citizens from different backgrounds and origins in the policy analysis to gather and study their understanding, perceptions, opinions and positions, thus contributing to co-designing and co-assessing the most appropriate policies' recommendations. Citizen platforms if existing, can be used for this purpose.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research.</p> <p>Governance is all the processes of interactions be they through laws, norms, power or language of an organized society over a social system, done by the government of a state.</p><p>Policies are deliberate systems of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes.
